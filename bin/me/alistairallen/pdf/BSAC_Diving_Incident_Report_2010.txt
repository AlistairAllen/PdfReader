Introduction 
 
This booklet contains the 2010 Diving Incidents Report, produced by The British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC) in the 
interest of promoting diving safety.  It is important to note that it contains details of UK sports diving incidents 
occurring to divers of all affiliations, plus incidents occurring worldwide involving BSAC members.  
The 2010 ‘Incident Year’ ran from 1st October 2009 to 30th September 2010. 
 
Report Format 
The majority of statistical information contained within this report is also shown in graphical form.  Please note that all 
statistical information is produced from UK data only and does not include Overseas Incidents unless noted as ‘All 
Incidents’. 
 
The contents of this report are split into an overview of the year, and then the details of nine incident categories plus some 
historical analyses.  The various sections can be found as shown below:- 
 
 i) Overview Page  1 
 ii) Fatalities Page 5 
 iii) Decompression Incidents Page  8 
 iv) Injury / illness Page  18 
 v) Boating & Surface Incidents Page  23 
 vi) Ascent Incidents Page  29 
 vii) Technique Incidents Page  35 
 viii) Equipment Incidents Page  36 
 ix) Miscellaneous Incidents Page  38 
 x) Overseas Incidents Page  40 
 xi) Numerical & Statistical Analyses Page  44 
 xii) List of Abbreviations Page  46 
 
 
Within each category the incidents are listed in the order of their occurrence, not necessarily that of Incident Reference.  
They are laid out in the following form: 
 
  MONTH/YEAR OF INCIDENT  INCIDENT REF.    
  Brief Narrative of Incident.................................................................................... 
  ........................................................................................................ 
 
The nature of many diving incidents is such that there is usually more than one cause or effect.  Where this is the case the 
incident has been classified under the more appropriate cause or effect. For instance an incident involving a fast ascent, 
causing decompression illness, will be classified under 'Decompression Incidents'.

Overview 
 
has followed the pattern of recent years in terms 
of the number of reported incidents.  364 UK 
incidents have been recorded and this is in line 
with the last few years where the average has been somewhat 
under 400.   
This year saw the presentation of the incident report move from 
the Diving Officers’ Conference which was typically in early 
December to the Diving Conference in mid February.  This 
extension of preparation time allowed us to extend the period 
during which we would accept incident information for the 
report.  In the past the cut-off date was mid October; this year 
the same cut-off was announced but because of the additional 
time available reports that arrived up to the end of November 
were accepted.  There was concern that this extension would 
distort the figures when comparisons were made with previous 
years.  To address this a record was kept of those ‘additional’ 
reports so that the effect could be quantified.  In the end only 
twelve more reports were added in this period and, as a result, 
it was considered that the effects of this would be negligible.  
These twelve reports were included and the analysis was 
completed as in previous years.

The distribution of reported incidents by month is shown in the 
following chart and it follows the normal pattern, with 74% of the 
dives taking place in the summer months.  This is slightly higher 
than the average of previous years but this difference is not 
thought to be significant.

Incidents by category 
The incident database assigns all incidents into one of nine 
major categories, and the following chart shows the distribution 
of the 2010 incidents into those categories.

0 20 40 60 80 100

Technique
Equipment
Fatalities
Miscellaneous
Inj ury / Illness
Ascents
Boat / surface
DCI
As in all previous years (except 2007) the largest category 
relates to cases of ‘Decompression illness’ (DCI).   DCI cases 
saw a dramatic reduction in 2007 and it was hoped that this 
marked the beginning of a downward trend.  However, 2008 
and 2009 saw a return to the average of recent years.  This 
year the number of recorded cases was 98; lower than the 
previous two years and in line with a longer term trend of a 
general reduction from a significant peak in 2002.  More detail 
on DCI incidents is given later. 
The second largest category is ‘Boating and Surface’ incidents.  
This category mainly comprises of problems with boat engines 
(engine failure and out of fuel) and lost diver(s).  This category 
had seen a very strong downward trend over previous  years 
due to reductions in both types of incident.  However in 2009 
this number rose dramatically to levels not seen for eight years.  
This year the number of incidents in this category (85) is lower 
than 2009 but still higher than in recent previous years.  This 
increase is entirely due to an increase in boating problems.  
The number of ‘lost diver’ reports is slightly down from previous 
years and indicates a slow downward trend in the number of 
this type of incident.  
The third category is ‘Ascents’ where divers have made an 
abnormal ascent but avoided DCI.  This category has seen a 
steady decline in the number of recorded incidents since a peak 
in 2006.  Prior to this date the number of incidents each year 
had been steadily rising.  The major initiative that has been 
underway in recent years to address poor buoyancy control 
seems to have had a significant effect and this year’s total of 65 
incidents is slightly up on last year but still indicative of a 
general improvement in this area.  More on ‘Ascents’ can be 
found later in this report.   
The fourth category is ‘Illness and injury’ and the bulk of this is 
thought to be cases of DCI.  But these cases are reported 
through the RNLI and their reports do not specifically record 
DCI, they often just state ‘Diver illness’.  For this reason it is not 
possible to distinguish cases of DCI from other diver ailments.  
The number of incidents reported in this category each year has 
remained constant for the last twelve years at around 55 per 
year. 
Although small in number ‘Fatalities’ are the most important 
category and these are also covered later in some detail.

Incident depths 
The following chart shows the maximum depth of the dives 
during which incidents took place, categorised into depth range 
groupings.

The pattern of depths in the 0m to 50m range is very similar to 
that normally seen and reflects the amount of diving that takes 
place in these depth ranges.   
The number of incidents reported in the greater than 50m range 
is 2, much lower than in previous years.  One of these incidents 
was a fatality which occurred during a dive to a maximum depth 
of 60m where the diver was using trimix. 
  
BSAC advises that no air dive should be deeper than 50m, and 
that dives to 50m should only be conducted by divers who are 
appropriately trained and qualified.   
The recommended limit for divers trained to Sports Diver 
standard is 35m and then only when they have received 
appropriate training for diving at this depth. 
BSAC recommends that helium mixtures are used for depths 
deeper than 40m and that mixed gas diving should be to a 
maximum depth of 80m.  Mixed gas dives should only be 
conducted when the diver holds a recognized qualification to 
conduct such dives.  
See the BSAC website for more details of these and other 
diving depth limit recommendations.  
 
The next chart shows the depths at which incidents started.

Inevitably the data are biased towards the shallower depths 
since many incidents happen during the ascent or at the 
surface.  Critical among these are the DCI cases where almost 
always the casualty is out of the water before any problems are 
noted.  This partially explains the large occurrence of ‘Surface’ 
cases as this includes divers with DCI who have left the water. 
Other surface incidents involve boats and boating incidents and 
divers who are lost but on the surface. 
There is one case shown in the >60m category that is not 
shown in the >60m category in the ‘Maximum depth’ chart, this 
is because the maximum depth of this particular incident was 
not recorded.   
 
Diver qualifications 
The next two charts show the qualification of those BSAC 
members who were involved in reported incidents.    
The first looks at the diver qualification.

These data are in line with the normal pattern of previous years 
and  probably reflect the number of divers in these qualification 
grades.

The low number for ‘Club’ instructor almost certainly reflects the 
fact that this qualification is no longer part of the instructor

Divers’ use of the Emergency Services 
Divers’ use of the emergency services shows a monthly 
distribution aligned to the distribution of all incidents, and is 
clearly correlated with the number of dives that are taking place. 
 
235 incidents were reported to us by the Coastguard; this is 
entirely consistent with recent years.

There were 107 incidents reported that involved the RNLI.  
Previous years had seen a steady decline in divers’ need for 
lifeboat assistance.  Last year saw this number jump upwards 
by over 30% to 134 incidents, a level not seen for over twelve 
years.  This year’s total is down from last year’s high and much 
more in line with previous years.  The RNLI’s main involvement 
with divers involves assistance with disabled boats, searching 
for missing divers and the recovery of divers with DCI.

In 2010 112 incidents involved the use of helicopters.  This 
number supports the suggestion made last year that incidents 
involving helicopter rescue are levelling out to a little over 100 
per year.  
In diving related incidents helicopters are mainly tasked to 
support searches for missing divers and to transport divers with 
DCI to recompression facilities.

Fatalities 
17 fatal incidents occurred in the UK during the 2010 incident 
year.  This is above the average of 15.8 fatalities per year over 
the previous ten years.  However, comparisons of this nature 
need to be made with caution since a small change to such low 
numbers can make a big apparent difference to the result.   
8 of these people were BSAC members.  The ten year average 
for BSAC fatalities in the UK is 5.9 fatalities per year and thus, 
from a member’s perspective, it has been an unfortunate year. 
The factors associated with all of these fatalities can be 
summarised as follows:- 
? Three cases involved divers who died of ‘natural causes’.  
Two of these were heart attacks and the third was not 
specified.  In two other cases it seems very probable that 
similar issues arose but there is currently insufficient 
information available to be certain of this.  
? Ten cases involved a separation of some kind.  Four of 
these cases occurred during the ascent from a dive when 
divers became separated; one of these cases involved the 
use of an alternative gas source. Two cases involved three 
or more divers diving together.  Two cases involved divers 
in difficulties during a dive who made direct lone ascents to 
the surface (one from 60m). Two cases involved divers in 
difficulties during a dive where a separation occurred and 
one diver failed to surface.  One case involved a diver who 
became tangled with a shot line during an ascent.  One 
case involved a diver who was thought (incorrectly it 
subsequently transpired) by his buddy to have aborted the 
dive during the descent.  
? Two cases involved rapid ascents and probable 
barotrauma. 
? Two cases involved divers who ran out of breathing gas. 
? One case involved a solo snorkel diver.   
 
Often multiple causes were involved in an incident and with 
many of these fatal incidents there is currently insufficient 
information available to be clear about the exact chain of events 
and specific root causes.  Often new information comes to light 
(from coroners’ inquests for example) after the publication of the 
annual report.  Such information is added to the incident 
database for future research purposes.   
 
Diver age  was highlighted last year as a feature of note in the 
year’s fatal incidents.  8 (57%) of the 2009 fatalities involved 
divers over the age of 50.  This year the number of fatal 
incidents involving divers over the age of 50 was again 8, 
equating to 47% of the 2010 fatalities.  This is against a 
background of only 16% of the diving population being over 50 
(from a BSAC UK site survey). The natural tendency is for 
health and fitness to decline with increasing age and the above 
numbers seem to indicate that divers need to pay more 
attention to these aspects as they grow older.

  ` NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2010

Unusually this year there were no fatal incidents involving 
rebreather divers, only one fatal incident involving a dive to a 
depth greater than 50m and only one death involving a solo 
diver.  In previous years these factors were key elements of the 
fatality statistics.   
Note; during the preparation of a fatalities analysis this year an 
error was found in the 1999 data.  The report recorded 17 
fatalities, but is was discovered that this included a double 
count of a fatality that had occurred in the previous year.  A 
much later press report had been published and led to the belief 
that a separate incident had occurred.  This error has been 
corrected and the chart on page 45, which shows the history of 
annual fatalities, has been amended accordingly.   
 
Decompression incidents 
The BSAC database contains 98 reports of ‘DCI’ incidents in 
the 2010 incident year, some of which involved more than one 
casualty.  When these multiple cases are counted the result is 
105 cases of DCI. 
 
An analysis of the causal factors associated with the 98 
incidents reported in 2009 indicates the following major 
features:- 
29 involved repeat diving  
23 involved rapid ascents 
18 involved diving to deeper than 30m 
15 involved missed decompression stops  
Some cases involved more than one of these causes. 
 
As stated earlier, some of the ‘Injury and Illness’ incidents are 
also thought to be DCI related.   
 
Ascent related incidents 
Although this year has seen a slight increase over last year 
‘Ascent’ related incidents have fallen dramatically over the last 
four years and some of this decline is likely to be due to the 
focus that has been placed on this important area of diving skill. 
65 cases of ‘Ascent’ problems have been recorded in 2010 and 
the majority of these were ‘rapid ascents’.  An analysis of these 
‘rapid ascents’ (where the detail is known) is as follows:- 
 21% Simply poor buoyancy control  
 19% Panic / anxiety / rush for surface  
 14% Delayed SMB problems  
    12% Drysuit control malfunction/mis-use 
 9% Weighting or weight related problems 
    9% Regulator free flows 
 2% Out of air / gas 
 
These causal factors are very similar to those seen in abnormal 
ascents for many previous years. 
 
It is certain that many other such cases have gone un-reported 
but it is anticipated that these root causes will apply to all 
uncontrolled ascents.   
 
Many DCI cases have their roots in these problems; they have 
been recorded under the ‘DCI’ heading but the causal factors 
are often the same, so the actual number of abnormal ascents 
will be significantly higher than 65 cases.  This year’s DCI 
cases included 23 incidents where rapid ascents had taken 
place. 
 
Conclusions 
Key conclusions are:- 
? The number of incidents reported each year in the UK 
seems to have levelled out at around 370 cases. 
? The number of fatalities of BSAC members is 2 above the 
average of the previous 10 years. 
? The number of fatalities of non-BSAC members is 1 lower 
than the average of the previous 10 years. 
? Diver age and related health and fitness issues is emerging 
as a critical factor in this and recent years’ fatalities.  The 
average age of the subjects of this year’s diving fatalities 
was 50.5 years (almost identical to 2009); the average age 
of the background diving population is 38. 
? The deepest depth recorded in the incident database was 
64m and the deepest depth involving a fatality was 60m; 
previous years have seen much greater depths than this 
reported. 
? There were no fatalities involving rebreather divers. In 
recent years rebreather deaths were a significant proportion 
of the total and thought to be disproportionately high 
compared to the number of rebreathers in use.  
? Only one death of a solo diver was recorded.  Again, in 
recent years, solo diving fatalities have been 
disproportionately high.  
? Incidents relating to boat problems (engine and fuel) have 
increased in the last two years.   
 
 
 
As has been stated many times before, most of the incidents 
reported within this document could have been avoided had 
those involved followed a few basic principles of safe diving 
practice.  The BSAC publishes a booklet called 'Safe Diving' 
(latest edition published in September 2010). which 
summarises all the key elements of safe diving and is available 
to all, free of charge, from the BSAC website or through BSAC 
HQ. 
 
Remember you can never have too much practice and the 
further you stay away from the limits of your own personal 
capabilities the more likely you are to continue to enjoy your 
diving. 
 
Please browse through the details in this report and use them to 
learn from others’ mistakes. They have had the courage and 
generosity to record their experiences for publication, the least 
that we can do is to use this information to avoid similar 
problems. 
 
Finally, if you must have an incident please report it using our 
Incident Report form, available free via the BSAC website or 
from BSAC HQ. 
As always, your anonymity is assured – great care is taken to 
preserve the confidentiality of any personal information 
recorded in BSAC Incident Reports.

Fatalities 
 
October 2009 10/001 
The emergency services were alerted when a lone 
spearfisherman failed to return to shore.  An extensive search 
was conducted involving a helicopter, a lifeboat, other vessels 
and Coastguard rescue teams, but it was eventually called off 
due to very severe weather conditions.  The diver's orange float 
and speargun were found but no trace of the diver.  His body 
was found, washed ashore, eleven days later. 
October 2009 10/003 
A diver was recovered from the water after a 14 min dive to a 
maximum depth of 23m.  She had become separated from her 
dive group and at one point during the dive she had become 
caught on the shotline at a depth of 5m.  She was towed 
ashore, resuscitation techniques were applied and a pulse and 
breathing were restored.  An ambulance and a helicopter 
attended; the casualty was airlifted to hospital but died six days 
later.  The cause of death was severe hypoxic-ischaemic brain 
injury following water inhalation, pneumothorax and cardiac 
arrest. 
October 2009 10/002 
Three divers were conducting a safety stop, on a shotline, at a 
depth of 6m.  The leader of this group noticed a diver on the 
shotline below them in a horizontal position.  Nothing seemed 
wrong and he focused his attention back to his buddies.  He 
then noticed a diver above them, inverted, attempting to pull 
himself down the shotline.  He ascended to assist this diver.  
The diver had air in his drysuit legs and could not right himself.  
Two of the divers helped him to regain an upright position and 
he was then able to vent his suit.  During this time the divers 
sank back down to 11m.  The diver who had been inverted then 
indicated that he was out of air.  The leader of the three divers 
gave him his main regulator and deployed his alternative air 
source.  However he was unable to detach the hose of this 
regulator from its clip due to the proximity of the other diver and 
he was taking in water through this regulator.  At this point the 
buoyant diver's buddy appeared and the diver who was 
struggling with water in his regulator indicated to the buddy to 
give the buoyant diver his pony regulator; this he did and the 
buoyant diver seemed to be breathing normally.  The diver who 
was struggling to breathe recovered his own main regulator and 
this resolved his problems.  The buoyant diver indicated to his 
buddy that they should ascend, this they did with one of the 
group of three accompanying them.  The diver who had 
donated his main regulator ascended normally with the second 
of his buddies.  When the buoyant diver reached the surface he 
was seen face down with the shotline tangled around his head.  
The two divers with him removed the rope and lifted his face 
from the water; he was unconscious.  They signalled an 
emergency to the boat, removed the unconscious diver's 
weights and one of the pair gave him rescue breaths.  The 
unconscious diver was recovered into the boat, the emergency 
services were alerted and resuscitation techniques were 
continued.  The casualty was taken by lifeboat to the shore 
where he was declared dead.  Others involved in the rescue 
were placed on oxygen but no ill effects were reported.  
Second-hand reports of the post mortem indicated that the diver 
has suffered a cerebral arterial gas embolism. 
October 2009 10/004 
Two divers were 12 min into a dive at a depth of 50m when they 
became separated.  Silt reduced the visibility and after a short 
search one of the pair surfaced.  When the second diver failed 
to surface the emergency services were alerted.  Police divers 
were called to assist and the missing diver's body was found 
and recovered 12 hours later.

November 2009 10/005 
A diver developed problems at a depth of 30m.  He was 
recovered to the surface and removed from the water.  
Resuscitation techniques were applied and the emergency 
services were alerted.  The casualty was airlifted to a 
recompression facility but declared dead before any treatment 
could be given. 
January 2010 10/060 
After a training dive to a maximum depth of 10m for a duration 
of 55 min a group of four divers surfaced without problems after 
completing a safety stop. The group were approximately 15m 
from shore. One of the divers indicated that he had lost his 
weights. The lead diver told the others to return to shore and he 
would recover the weights. The lead diver descended to the 
seabed at a depth of approximately 2m and located the weights 
approximately 5-6m away. He recovered the weights and swam 
back along the seabed until in a depth of around 1.5m. At this 
point he came across one of the other divers on the seabed. 
The diver failed to respond to signals and was recovered to the 
surface where the lead diver signalled for assistance from the 
others. The casualty was recovered to the shore, his equipment 
removed and CPR conducted for 20-30 min until an ambulance 
arrived. The diver did not survive. 
April 2010 10/061 
A diver collapsed shortly after entering the water for a dive and 
before leaving the surface. The diver was recovered to the dive 
boat and resuscitation efforts were made. The diver was airlifted 
to hospital but did not recover.  Two lifeboats were launched to 
assist.  Initial indications were that the diver suffered a heart 
attack.

April 2010 10/063 
A group of divers were diving from a charter boat on an 
underwater wall. One pair descended to 35m with no sign of the 
wall or the seabed. One of the pair deployed his delayed SMB 
but was noticed by his buddy to still be descending even though 
he was winding in the reel. He descended to a maximum depth 
of 48m before ascending past his buddy, in sight but out of 
reach, and continued directly to the surface. The diver was seen 
from the charter boat to surface and to start finning towards the 
boat. However, as the boat approached him the diver was not 
moving and he began to drift past the diver lift.  A member of 
the crew jumped into the water and was able to get the diver 
onto the lift and recover him into the boat. Resuscitation 
attempts were made using oxygen enriched CPR. A lifeboat, 
which had been out on exercise, attended and a doctor onboard 
pronounced death.

10 min into a dive on a wreck at 22m a diver indicated to his 
buddy that he was not happy. He removed his SMB reel from 
his BCD pocket but then was unable to unzip his other BCD 
pocket to remove his delayed SMB. His buddy deployed his 
own delayed SMB and both divers began to ascend. The buddy 
was concentrating on reeling in line and lost sight of the 
troubled diver and did not see him again until he surfaced to 
see him on the boat lift. The troubled diver had surfaced and 
signalled the boat which manoeuvred to recover him. The boat 
stopped short and the skipper threw the diver a line which the 
diver held on to.  He was pulled onto the lift and recovered to 
deck level. Once at deck level the diver collapsed unconscious 
onto the deck. The diver's equipment was removed and 
resuscitation attempts were made whilst an emergency call was 
made to the Coastguard. The diver was transported by rescue 
helicopter to hospital but he did not recover. His equipment was 
inspected and found to be in good working order. A post 
mortem examination and Coroner's inquest found the cause of 
death to be a heart attack. 
April 2010 10/064 
A group of twelve divers were diving a wreck from a charter 
boat. The divers began entering the water before slack water. 
One pair swam to the shotline and the first diver to arrive 
descended below the surface to allow his buddy space to get 
onto the shotline. He watched his buddy grab the line between 
the shotline and the leader buoy but he remained on the 
surface. After two more pairs of divers had descended the shot 
the first diver ascended with some difficulty maintaining a grip 
on the shot due to the current. When he surfaced his buddy was 
no longer on the line, he then became tangled in the leader line 
and spent some time untangling himself. Once untangled he 
saw a single diver on the boat that he was certain was his 
buddy. The first diver then joined another buddy pair and 
undertook the dive. After the dive it became apparent that the 
buddy had not been on the boat and could not be found.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and a search was initiated involving a 
helicopter, two lifeboats and other craft but the diver was not 
found.  The missing diver was located the following day on the 
seabed close to the wreck.  A subsequent press report stated 
that he had died of natural causes. 
April 2010 10/065 
A pair of divers descended a shotline to a maximum depth of 
31m onto a wreck. At the bottom of the shotline one of the 
divers appeared confused and was not responding normally. 
The diver did not appear happy and began ascending back up 
the line and did not respond to signals. His buddy accompanied 
him up the line signalling for him to take it steady. The diver was 
pulling himself up the line breathing steadily but did not respond 
to signals or other communications. Just below the surface the 
diver stopped. He was still breathing but remained 
unresponsive. His buddy assisted him to the surface and called 
for assistance from the charter boat they were diving from. The 
diver was de-kitted by his buddy and recovered onto the boat 
with the assistance of the crew and resuscitation attempts were 
made including oxygen enriched rescue breaths. The diver was 
airlifted to hospital by helicopter but did not survive. A post 
mortem could not confirm the cause of death.

A group of eight divers were diving a wreck from a dive charter 
boat. One pair of divers had completed a 20 min of dive to a 
maximum depth of 30m. When one diver checked the other's air 
contents, the buddy indicated having 70 bar which was less 
than expected given past experience and he indicated to start 
their ascent. The pair jointly deployed a delayed SMB as 
previously agreed and began their ascent. As they approached 
5m the first diver indicated that they should conduct a safety 
stop but his buddy continued straight on to the surface. The first 
diver surfaced shortly afterwards and his buddy shouted at him 
that he could not breathe and he saw him being sick. The diver 
swam towards his buddy, inflated both their BCDs and tried to 
reassure him whilst signalling for assistance to boats in the 
area. A RHIB carrying divers from another group responded and 
began resuscitation of the casualty whist his equipment was 
being removed. They then recovered the casualty into the RHIB 
and continued resuscitation efforts until a helicopter arrived. 
The helicopter transferred the casualty to hospital but he did not 
survive. The casualty's buddy was placed on oxygen and 
subsequently reported a tingling in his feet. He was 
subsequently airlifted to a recompression chamber as a 
precaution. 
May 2010 10/087 
5 min into a dive at a depth of 16m a diver found his buddy lying 
on his side with his mask half full of water. The diver recovered 
the casualty to the surface and after a struggle managed to 
recover the casualty into their charter boat with the assistance 
of the crew. Resuscitation efforts were made during the return 
to harbour where they were met by a doctor and ambulance 
crew. Resuscitation efforts continued for over an hour but the 
casualty did not survive.  A lifeboat and helicopter were tasked 
to support.

After a 20 min dive to a wreck at 60m a diver surfaced rapidly 
and missed all required decompression stops. The skipper of 
the boat saw the diver come out of the water 'like a torpedo' and 
then fall back face down in the water. The diver was then seen 
finning to try and get back down, he then raised an arm to 
signal distress and then went motionless. The skipper 
positioned his boat beside the diver, lowered the stern lift, with 
himself on it, and used the boathook to pull the diver alongside. 
The diver grabbed the lift handle and his grip couldn't be 
released; this gave the skipper some difficulty in getting the 
diver onto the lift. The skipper cut off the diver's equipment and 
began CPR. The Coastguard was contacted, a rescue 
helicopter was scrambled and the diver airlifted to hospital but 
he did not recover. (Coastguard & media reports). 
July 2010 10/170 
A coxswain and group of twelve divers were diving as six buddy 
pairs on a drift dive between 20m and 30m. A delayed SMB 
from the last pair of divers was sighted in the vicinity of a fishing 
boat but there were no bubbles seen to be coming from 
beneath it. A second delayed SMB was seen close by and a 
diver surfaced beside it alone. A surface search was initiated for 
the second diver and the Coastguard alerted.  The Coastguard 
tasked a helicopter and two lifeboats to support the search.   
Whilst the surface search was ongoing two divers from the 
group descended the first delayed SMB and located the missing 
diver at the end of the line. His regulator was out of his mouth 
and pressing the drysuit inflator produced no effect. Unable to 
recover the casualty the divers returned to the surface. Some 
time later a second pair of divers descended and recovered the 
casualty to the surface and helped recover the diver into a 
lifeboat. Resuscitation efforts were made but the casualty was 
pronounced dead on arrival at hospital. 
August 2010 10/176 
A pair of divers experienced difficulties at a depth of 15m and 
one of them failed to surface from the dive. The alarm was 
raised and a surface search was initiated by the Coastguard 
involving an SAR helicopter, a lifeboat and more than twenty 
other vessels. The diver's body was located underwater 
approximately 4 hours later. 
August 2010 10/190 
A student and her instructor were conducting training in 2m of 
water on a dive from the shore. Approximately 20 min into the 
dive the student was practicing a drysuit inversion recovery 
exercise when she accidentally knocked the instructor's 
regulator from her mouth. After recovering the regulator the 
instructor saw the student close to the surface; she appeared to 
be panicked and to have lost orientation. The student then 
descended again and at first appeared to have regained 
composure but then continued to fall backwards. The instructor 
noticed that student's regulator was missing and her arms were 
moving as if she was trying to locate it. The instructor recovered 
the regulator and presented it to the student twice but there was 
no response. The instructor raised the student to the surface 
using a controlled buoyant lift and shouted for help. Other 
members of the party responded, helped recover the student 
from the water and basic life support was started. One member 
of the group ran to the nearby Coastguard station for 
assistance. The Coastguard alerted an ambulance and rescue 
helicopter. An ambulance arrived and assisted with basic life 
support until the helicopter arrived to airlift the diver to hospital. 
The diver did not recover.

Decompression Incidents 
 
October 2009  10/253 
Portland Coastguard received a call from a dive boat advising 
that they were returning to harbour with a diver onboard who 
had symptoms of DCI.  Coastguard helicopter R-106 was 
tasked to airlift the diver and he was met at the helicopter 
landing site by Poole CRT and a dive doctor and transferred by 
ambulance to Poole hyperbaric chamber for treatment.  The 
boat was met when it returned to shore by Lyme Regis CRT.  
(Coastguard report). 
October 2009 10/014 
A diver conducted a dive with two buddies to a submarine 
wreck at a maximum depth of 36m for a dive time of 28 min. On 
reaching an agreed minimum remaining gas pressure and after 
deploying a delayed SMB the divers started to ascend. The 
subject diver noticed he was having difficulty maintaining 
neutral buoyancy and having to work hard to avoid a fast 
ascent. He experienced further difficulty maintaining a 5m 
safety stop and was starting to breathe heavily. A 3 min safety 
stop was completed and the diver surfaced but was unable to 
inflate his BCD because he had run out of gas and so had to 
orally inflate. Once back onboard the boat the diver reported 
feeling sick, tired and had a red rash on his right hand. He was 
put on oxygen and airlifted off by helicopter to a recompression 
facility where he received treatment. The diver subsequently 
reported that his previous ten dives had been in fresh water and 
he had not adjusted his weights for seawater. (Coastguard 
report). 
October 2009 10/015 
A diver conducted a 16m dive for 45 min duration using nitrox 
32 and conducted a 3 min safety stop. Conditions were good 
but there was some underwater surge. After a surface interval 
of 3 hours a second dive was completed to 16m for a duration 
of 45 min again using nitrox 32 and with a 3 min safety stop. 2 
hours after surfacing from the second dive the diver reported 
experiencing dizziness, nausea, a 'disoriented/disconnected 
feeling' and started to develop tingling in her left hand. Contact 
was made with a hyperbaric centre and advice was given for 
the diver to be placed on oxygen and attend hospital to be 
checked out. On attending hospital the diver was admitted 
overnight for observation and placed on oxygen. Improvement 
was seen in the morning and the diver was discharged. During 
the drive home over hills the diver again became unwell and 
advice was given to drive to a hyperbaric facility for treatment. 
The diver received three hyperbaric treatments which resolved 
most symptoms leaving only mild sensation abnormalities, 
which resolved fully after a week. 
October 2009 10/016 
A diver conducted two wreck dives in the same day. The first 
was to 40m for a duration of 36 min including 12 min of 
decompression stops. After a 2 hour 6 min surface interval the 
second dive was 30m for a duration of 46 min including 14 min 
of decompression stops. The sea state for both dives was 
reported as a moderate swell. Approximately 1 hour 30 min 
after surfacing from the second dive the diver started to notice a 
pain in the surface of her chest. Once back on land the diver 
noticed a mottled rash that was slightly itchy on her stomach, 
back and chest. The diver also had soreness and swelling in 
her breasts. She took two litres of water and two aspirin and 
noticed an improvement in symptoms within an hour.  The rash 
and pain had disappeared 4 hours later and so the diver 
decided not to call for medical assistance. The following 
morning the diver noticed a slight ache in her shoulder that did 
not worsen; the diver associated this with picking up diving kit. 
The next day the ache was still present and the arm was noted 
to be weaker and the diver called the DCI helpline. A skin and 
lymphatic DCI was diagnosed and the diver was referred to the 
local A & E for neurological tests which proved normal. No 
further treatment was given. The diver was recommended to 
seek referral for a PFO test. 
October 2009 10/010 
A diver conducted a first dive to a depth of 42m for 35 minute 
duration. After a surface interval of 2 hours he conducted a 
further dive to 26m for a duration of 25 min to collect scallops. 
Once back in the boat he experienced a pain in his arm and 
was placed on oxygen. The Coastguard was alerted and the 
diver was airlifted to a recompression facility. He received 
recompression therapy. (Coastguard report). 
October 2009 10/036 
Three divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 20m for a 
total of 34 min. One of the divers had some difficulty initially in 
getting down and one of his buddies placed some rocks in the 
pockets of his BCD to help. Towards the end of the dive as the 
group approached a depth of 6m to conduct a safety stop the 
diver who had rocks in his BCD pockets lost control of his 
buoyancy and started to ascend. The diver was unable to 
prevent an ascent to the surface despite dumping air from his 
suit and BCD but the ascent was not fast. On surfacing the 
diver experienced a brief nose bleed of about 2 seconds. The 
diver was joined by his buddies who surfaced shortly after and 
all exited the water together with no further symptoms. About 5 
min after leaving the water the diver experienced a strange 
feeling in his teeth and some pain in his nasal passage followed 
by a tingling in his face. The diver sought assistance, was 
placed on oxygen and advised to attend a local recompression 
facility. The diver was given two recompression treatments. 
October 2009 10/258 
Humber Coastguard received a call from North Tyneside 
hospital reporting they had a diver who had attended and was 
now showing signs and symptoms of DCI following a deep dive. 
Tyneside Volunteer Life Brigade (VLB) attended the hospital to 
assist with transferring the diver to a helicopter for transfer to 
Hull hyperbaric chamber.  Rescue helicopter R-131 lifted the 
diver from the hospital and was met at the HLS at Hull by CRT 
who assisted with taking the diver to the hyperbaric chamber.  
(Coastguard report). 
October 2009 10/260 
Shetland Coastguard received a call from a dive boat reporting 
that they had a diver onboard suffering mild symptoms of DCI.  
An ambulance was arranged to meet the boat on return to 
harbour and the diver was taken to the hyperbaric chamber at 
Stromness for assessment.  (Coastguard report). 
October 2009 10/262 
Clyde Coastguard received a call from a dive boat reporting 
they had a diver who was unconscious following a rapid ascent.  
Tobermory AWLB and rescue helicopter R-177 were tasked to 
proceed to their assistance.  The diver was airlifted and met at 
the HLS by Oban CRT where he was transferred to an 
ambulance and taken to hospital.  However, he was later 
transferred to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for hospital and 
hyperbaric chamber treatment.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports).

December 2009 10/038 
Two divers conducted an uneventful dive to a maximum depth 
of 28 m for a total duration of 41 min. Towards the end of the 
dive the first diver prepared to deploy his delayed SMB. His 
buddy took control of the reel whilst he inflated the delayed 
SMB using his alternate source. As the line deployed it looped 
around the first diver's pillar valve and dragged the diver to the 
surface. The diver regained control and descended again to 
18m where he rejoined his buddy. The pair then completed all 
required decompression stops and carried out a few minutes of 
additional stops. On surfacing the diver felt fine with no 
apparent symptoms. As a precaution the diver breathed 100% 
oxygen via a rebreather during the trip back to shore. The diver 
felt fine the rest of the day but awoke the next morning with 
numbness in one arm which did not clear so he contacted a 
recompression facility. He was advised to attend the chamber 
and en route experienced numbness start in the other arm. On 
arrival at the recompression chamber the diver was assessed, 
confirmed as suffering from DCI and received treatment at the 
chamber.

Two groups of divers, a pair and a trio, completed a night dive 
to a maximum depth of 11m and a duration of 20 and 29 min 
respectively. One of the divers experienced a buoyant ascent 
and separation from his buddies at the end of the dive. The 
following day this diver complained of a tingling in his arm. He 
contacted a recompression chamber and was advised to attend 
hospital and have them refer him to the chamber. He received a 
precautionary recompression treatment. 
February 2010 10/264 
Stornoway Coastguard received a call from a dive boat 
reporting they had a diver onboard suffering from a very minor 
symptom of DCI following an uncontrolled ascent from 25m.  
The diver had completed multiple dives over five consecutive 
days.  Medical advice from the hyperbaric chamber was that the 
diver should be transferred for immediate treatment.  Rescue 
helicopter R-100 airlifted the diver to Dunstaffnage hyperbaric 
chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
February 2010 10/266 
Belfast Coastguard received a call from a diver reporting he 
was feeling unwell having missed 6 min of decompression 
during a dive the previous day.    Medical advice from 
Craigavon hyperbaric chamber was that he should proceed to 
the chamber as soon as possible. He made his own way where 
he received successful hyperbaric treatment.  (Coastguard 
report). 
February 2010 10/056 
A diver completed two days diving within computer limits and 
with no problems reported. The diver had conducted three dives 
a day with maximum depths all between 14m and 20m and 
durations of 23 min to 34 min. On the evening of the first day 
the diver did not consume any alcohol due to feeling slightly 
dehydrated. The day after diving, during the afternoon, the diver 
experienced an ache in her right shoulder and contacted a 
recompression chamber helpline for advice. Initial advice was to 
take anti-inflammatories and a good night's sleep. Although a 
restful night was had the ache was still there the following day 
and the diver was contacted by the chamber and told to come 
in. The diver received two recompression treatments over two 
days and all symptoms were resolved. This was the second DCI 
incident the diver had suffered and so she was advised to 
consider a check for a PFO. 
March 2010 10/072 
A pair of divers conducted an uneventful dive to a maximum 
depth of 28m for a total duration of 45 min including a 3 min 
safety stop. Approximately 1 hour after the dive one of the 
divers felt dizzy and generally unwell. After resting for a further 
3 to 4 min the symptoms did not abate and movement of his 
head increased the dizziness, nausea and difficulties with 
balance. The diver alerted his buddy who conducted a 
neurological assessment and administered 100% oxygen. A 
diver clinic was contacted and evacuation by helicopter to a 
recompression chamber was arranged. At the chamber 
examination suggested a mild vestibular DCI and the diver 
underwent recompression treatment which resulted in a great 
improvement in the diver's condition. 
March 2010 10/073 
A group of three divers entered the water for a dive to a planned 
maximum depth of 20m for a maximum duration of 45 min. The 
divers encountered low visibility and so the lead diver 
connected the other pair with a buddy line and maintained close 
contact with one of the pair. After 26 min a decision was made 
to abort the dive. The lead diver then became separated from 
the others and ascended safely. The pair of divers started to 
ascend but one of the divers had the buddy line wrapped 
around her neck making it difficult to retain the regulator in her 
mouth. The other diver untangled the buddy line but during this 
time the divers were dragged down by the current to a 
maximum depth of 29m. The pair then regained control and 
ascended normally to a depth of 11m where they lost control 
again and ascended to the surface. One diver complained of a 
headache and the other felt a little unwell but after 
administering fluids both appeared to recover within a few 
minutes. The following day the diver who had been tangled in 
the buddy line was referred to a hyperbaric facility where she 
received recompression treatment. Both divers fully recovered. 
April 2010 10/272 
Falmouth Coastguard received a request from the hyperbaric 
chamber at DDRC in Plymouth requesting helicopter assistance 
to transfer a diver suffering from symptoms of DCI.  The diver 
had been making his own way to DDRC but suffered vehicle 
breakdown with his boat on route, while outside the base of the 
rescue helicopter!  Rescue helicopter R-193 was tasked from 
RNAS Culdrose to airlift the diver to DDRC for treatment.  
(Coastguard report).

April 2010 10/077 
During a training dive to a maximum depth of 8m and after a 
duration of 9 min, a student had difficulty in clearing his mask 
and inhaled water up his nose. This caused the diver to cough 
and spit out his regulator. One of two instructors present 
replaced the regulator but by this time the student was starting 
to panic and so a controlled buoyant lift was carried out and the 
student was towed back to shore. The student complained of a 
headache but was otherwise talking and responsive. The 
headache subsided over lunch and the student felt well enough 
to pack equipment and return home with a slight headache. 
Later the same day the student complained of a severe 
headache, neck pain and 'pins and needles' on one cheek of 
his face. The student was placed on oxygen. Advice was sought 
from a hyperbaric centre but recompression treatment was not 
advised. The next day the student was still complaining of a 
pain in the back of his neck and after further examination and 
consultation with a recompression facility he was referred for 
recompression treatment. 
April 2010 10/113 
An instructor and a student were conducting a training dive in 
the use of an SMB and achieved a maximum depth of 23m. 
Approximately 20 min into the dive at a depth of 20m the 
student started to point to her regulator first stage but the 
instructor could see nothing wrong. The student's regulator 
suddenly started to free flow and the student removed her 
second stage from her mouth because she could not see for the 
bubbles and started to swim for the surface. The instructor 
grabbed the student and put his own regulator into her mouth 
but then struggled to locate his own alternate regulator. During 
the confusion the pair separated. The instructor thought the 
student had gone to the surface but could see bubbles from a 
free flow coming from below. The instructor descended and 
located the student and noticed that her mask had fallen down 
her face, she had no regulator in place and her arms were 
flailing in panic. The instructor grabbed her and pushed her up 
as hard as he could. On surfacing the student was on her back 
crying out loud. The instructor swam to her whilst signalling the 
shore and he noticed a rescue boat making its way to them. 
The instructor tried to calm the student down and the rescue 
boat took her onboard and returned her to shore. The 
emergency services were called and the student was airlifted to 
a recompression chamber by helicopter and received 
recompression treatment. The student was discharged the next 
day. 
April 2010 10/279 
Clyde Coastguard received a call from the Air Rescue Centre 
advising they had received a request from the ambulance 
service for a diver to be airlifted to the hyperbaric chamber at 
Dunstaffnage.  The diver had come ashore the previous day 
with problems but felt alright. However he had become unwell 
and reported to his doctor.  Oban Sector Manager assisted at 
the helicopter landing site where the diver was transferred to an 
ambulance and taken to the hyperbaric chamber.  (Coastguard 
report). 
April 2010 10/103 
A diver conducted a series of six dives over a weekend all 
within computer limits and no fast or abnormal ascents and 
experienced a mild headache after one dive. The day after the 
last dive the diver experienced 'pins and needles' in fingers and 
lips, swollen fingers, numbness in right side of mouth, nose and 
cheek, numbness of lower right leg and foot and a severe 
headache. The diver was advised to contact a diving medical 
helpline and they advised attending a recompression facility. 
The diver received two sessions of recompression treatment 
and was discharged. 
April 2010 10/148 
A diver and her buddy completed an uneventful dive to a 
maximum depth of 15m for a total duration of 44 min including a 
3 min safety stop. On recovery into an RHIB the diver started to 
feel intense pain in her back and was sick. She then developed 
'pins and needles' in her feet and spasms in her hands and 
fingers. She was administered 100% oxygen and contact was 
made with the Coastguard by mobile phone after no response 
was received by VHF radio. A diving doctor was consulted and 
on the doctor's advice a helicopter was tasked to airlift the diver 
to a recompression facility. The diver received a total of seven 
recompression treatments for DCI over the next six days before 
being discharged. 
May 2010 10/211 
Two divers conducted two dives in a day 16m for 45 min 
including a 3 min safety stop and 20m for a total 36 min. On the 
second dive the divers had been collecting scallops. Towards 
the end of the dive they sent the scallops to the surface using a 
lifting bag. One of the divers inflated the lifting bag starting with 
60 bar of air and experienced a free flow. He stopped the free 
flow but did not check his contents again. The divers made an 
ascent up a delayed SMB. At 8m the diver ran out of air. His 
buddy provided an alternate source and they continued to 6m 
where both divers lost control of their buoyancy and made a 
rapid ascent direct to the surface. The divers were recovered 
into an RHIB. The first diver complained of no sensation in his 
left hand. He was given fluids and the oxygen set was prepared 
but found to be faulty even though it had just been serviced. 
Oxygen was provided but not in the most efficient way. After 10 
min the diver reported a return of feeling in his hand. Both 
divers were given oxygen for 20 min back on shore with no 
further problems reported. The first diver was subsequently 
found to have a PFO and scarring from pneumonia. 
May 2010 10/287 
Solent Coastguard received a call from a dive boat reporting 
they had a diver onboard who had missed decompression stops 
following a deep dive when he lost his buoyancy control. He 
was displaying signs and symptoms of DCI.  The boat had other 
divers in the water who could not immediately be recovered.  
The boat was placed in a medi-link call with a dive doctor who 
recommended immediate evacuation to a hyperbaric chamber.  
The diver was airlifted to the hyperbaric chamber by rescue 
helicopter R-104 and the fire service assisted at the HLS.  The 
boat recovered its remaining divers and was met on return by 
Selsey CRT.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2010 10/289 
Shetland Coastguard received a call from a dive boat reporting 
a diver onboard displaying signs and symptoms of DCI following 
missed decompression stops when he had a problem 
underwater.  The boat returned to harbour to be met by 
Stromness CRT who assisted with transferring him to an 
ambulance to be taken to Stromness hyperbaric chamber for 
treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2010 10/295 
Dover Coastguard received a 999 call reporting a diver onboard 
who was showing signs and symptoms of DCI.  Medical advice 
was that he should be evacuated as soon as possible.  Rescue 
helicopter R-104 from Solent airlifted him to the hyperbaric 
chamber at Whipps Cross Hospital in London.  (Coastguard 
report). 
May 2010 10/297 
Clyde Coastguard received a 999 call reporting a diver ashore 
who had symptoms of DCI.  Medical advice from the hyperbaric

chamber was that he should be evacuated to the chamber at 
Dunstaffnage for treatment.  He was transferred by an air 
ambulance and land ambulance, and Greenock and Oban 
CRTs assisted at the HLS when the diver was collected and at 
the hospital.  (Coastguard report).

Clyde Coastguard received a call from a doctor at Oban 
Hospital reporting they had been informed by the police on 
Skye that they had a man in custody who was reporting 
symptoms of DCI, after he had been diving over the previous 
two days. The hospital was given medical advice from a dive 
doctor at Aberdeen who advised that the diver was seen in 
hospital for assessment.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2010 10/298 
Milford Haven Coastguard received a 999 call from a diver 
reporting he was ashore and was suffering symptoms of DCI.  
Rescue helicopter R-169 airlifted the diver to the hyperbaric 
chamber at DDRC in Plymouth and Dale CRT assisted at the 
HLS when the diver was collected.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2010 10/118 
A diver and his buddy had conducted a wreck dive to a 
maximum depth of 29m and a bottom time of 39 min. During the 
decompression stop under a delayed SMB the diver's buddy 
required to use the diver's spare regulator. The buddy then 
began to ascend because he was a little under-weighted and 
the diver could not follow him because he had decompression 
stops to complete. The buddy had the delayed SMB and the 
diver had forgotten his own delayed SMB. The diver completed 
his decompression requirements in mid-water and without a 
marker. Total dive time was 79 min. This diver was reported as 
being overdue to the Coastguard  who tasked a SAR helicopter 
but when the diver surfaced safely the helicopter was stood 
down. Shortly afterwards the buddy complained of feeling ill and 
was airlifted to a chamber for recompression treatment. 
(Coastguard report). 
May 2010 10/117 
A diver completed two dives on two different wrecks. He later 
began displaying symptoms of DCI. The Coastguard was 
contacted and arranged for a helicopter landing site. The diver 
was transferred to the landing site by paramedics and the diver 
was airlifted to a recompression facility for treatment. (Media 
report). 
June 2010 10/303 
Stornoway Coastguard was alerted to a diver suffering from 
suspected DCI following a dive to 35m. Coastguard rescue 
helicopter R-100 was tasked to fly the casualty to Dunstaffnage 
chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2010 10/145 
Two divers completed a first dive without incident to 37m for a 
total duration of 33 min including 7 min of decompression stops. 
They then conducted a second dive 4 hours later on a wreck to 
a maximum depth of 39m. Towards the end of the dive one 
diver experienced a free flow on his primary regulator. He was 
diving with a manifolded twin-set with the manifold open. The 
diver tried to retain the free flowing regulator whist shutting 
down the manifold but was unable to, so he removed his rig and 
placed it on the wreck and shut it down, manifold first. The free 
flow stopped and the diver had 20 bar left in the affected 
cylinder. The diver carried his rig over to his buddy and the 
buddy deployed a delayed SMB. During the ascent the diver 
conducted a slow ascent but faster than his buddy until he 
reached 10m at which point he became hooked up on the 
buddy's delayed SMB line. The diver cleared the line but was 
unable to control his ascent and he surfaced without completing 
decompression stops and summoned assistance from the boat. 
He was recovered into the boat and placed on 100% oxygen. 
The tension on the line caused his buddy to release his reel and 
then deploy his spare delayed SMB. The buddy then conducted 
a normal ascent completing 10 min of required decompression 
stops.  The Coastguard was contacted and a helicopter was 
tasked to airlift the diver who had missed stops and transfer him 
to a recompression facility where he was treated for DCI. 
June 2010 10/307 
Diver had been taken to Glasgow hospital where the staff 
requested the diver be transferred to Dunstaffnage chamber.  
(Coastguard report). 
June 2010 10/121 
A diver completed a first dive to a wreck at 45m for a dive time 
of 53 min including 7 min of decompression stops with no 
adverse effects. After a surface interval of 3 hours a second 
dive was conducted to 24m for 37 min including a 4 min 
decompression stop again with no immediate adverse effects. 
Approximately 8 hours and 30 min after the second dive the 
diver awoke with 'pins and needles' and numbness in his right 
hand and aching in the forearm. Fluids were taken and advice 
sought by phone from a local recompression chamber. The 
diver was advised to attend the chamber for examination.  He 
received recompression treatment and was discharged with 
residual symptoms that were expected to resolve with time. 
June 2010 10/125 
MRCC Forth were contacted by a dive support vessel reporting 
they had a diver with suspected DCI heading for St. Abbs 
harbour.  The diver came up from a 16m stop from a 30m dive, 
the vessel had a doctor onboard, Forth Coastguard arranged for 
an ambulance to meet the vessel with inshore lifeboat from St. 
Abbs and Coastguard rescue team from Eyemouth, rescue 
helicopter R-131 airlifted the casualty to Aberdeen Hospital.  
(Coastguard report). 
June 2010 10/127 
A diver had completed a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 
45m using nitrox 25. All stops required by a dive computer were 
completed including deep stops. The diver boarded the charter 
boat using a stern lift, de-kitted and experienced no ill effects. 
The boat returned to harbour and whilst unloading equipment 
the diver experienced vertigo and nausea. A local dive centre 
was alerted and contact was made with the Coastguard and 
100% oxygen provided. The Coastguard tasked a rescue 
helicopter and the diver was taken onboard another charter 
vessel to facilitate transfer from the deck. The diver was taken 
by helicopter to a recompression facility where he received 
recompression treatment for DCI. 
June 2010 10/130 
A diver and his buddy conducted a first dive of the day to a 
maximum depth of 27m and a total duration of 43 min. Surface 
conditions were of a long swell and, whilst waiting for the last 
pair of divers to surface, many of the dive group felt queasy and 
some decided not to do a second dive. During a surface interval 
the subject diver went back to bed and slept. After a surface 
interval of 2 hour and 48 min the diver was woken and asked if 
he was diving and he said 'Yes'. The diver and his buddy 
conducted a second dive to a maximum depth of 24m for 43 
min. The pair were the first to surface and regain the boat. 
Again several divers felt queasy in the swell and the diver along 
with two others went and sat quietly on a bench behind the

cabin. On returning to harbour equipment was prepared for 
storage or offloading. The diver climbed the harbour wall ladder 
a short distance onto the harbour and then collapsed and 
vomited. The diver laid still and was able to communicate but 
was unwilling to move. The diver complained of stomach 
cramps, nausea and feeling dizzy. A local doctor, who was 
passing, was called and took charge. An ambulance was called 
and 100% oxygen administered as a precaution.  Advice was 
sought from a hyperbaric facility. The diver was taken by 
ambulance to hospital during which his condition worsened. On 
arrival at hospital the diver had developed a skin rash. He was 
given intravenous fluids and transported by ambulance to a 
recompression chamber where he received recompression 
treatment for an inner ear DCI. The diver was discharged the 
following day. 
June 2010 10/315 
Solent Coastguard was contacted by a dive support vessel 
informing them they had a diver onboard suffering from 
suspected DCI, following a medical connect call the casualty 
was airlifted by Coastguard rescue helicopter R-104 and 
transferred to Chichester hospital, the HLS was prepared by 
Selsey Coastguard.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2010 10/171 
A diver and her buddy conducted two dives during a day, 9m for 
35 min and 10m for 42 min. Approximately 90 min after 
surfacing from the second dive the diver experienced severe 
dizziness, nausea and pain in her left ear. She subsequently 
noticed a dull ache in her left shoulder and numbness in both 
hands. The diver received oxygen which eased the shoulder 
ache. The diver was referred to a recompression chamber and 
received recompression treatment to rule out DCI which 
resulted in a rapid improvement in symptoms. The diver had 
received previous recompression treatment prior to being 
diagnosed with a large PFO. She had a PFO closure and 
subsequent checks on the closure and lungs have indicated 
there is no underlying problem. It has been suggested that the 
diver may have suffered from salt water aspiration syndrome 
and not DCI. 
June 2010 10/233 
At the end of a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 23m a diver 
deployed his delayed SMB. In doing so he over-inflated the 
delayed SMB, his octopus began to free flow and his reel 
snatched and jammed. The diver was dragged up 
approximately 4m whilst releasing the reel and then, whilst 
trying to stop the free flow, it tangled again and he was dragged 
up further. The diver abandoned the reel and stopped the free 
flow but was unable to dump sufficient air from his drysuit and 
therefore surfaced. On leaving the seabed the diver had 1 min 
of required decompression stops at 3m but on the surface his 
computer showed 'SOS' and 9 min of stops required at 3m. The 
diver self-administered oxygen for 30 min and refrained from 
diving for the rest of the day. No symptoms appeared. The 
following day the diver felt unusually tired and consulted a DCI 
helpline. He attended a chamber for assessment and although 
no obvious signs or symptoms were found he received a 
precautionary treatment and was advised to refrain from diving 
for six weeks. 
June 2010 10/320 
Diver admitted to Glasgow Hospital, the duty doctor contacted 
Clyde Coastguard as he though he may need the Dunstaffnage 
chamber to treat a diver who had problems with one leg 
following a dive.  (Coastguard report). 
 
June 2010 10/322 
Stornoway Coastguard received a call from a dive support 
vessel reporting that they had a diver aboard suffering from 
nausea and a rash following a dive to 22m, medical advice was 
sought and the doctor recommended the casualty and buddy be 
airlifted to a recompression chamber for treatment. Rescue 
helicopter R-100 was tasked with Broadford Coastguard 
assisting with the HLS and refuelling. The casualty was taken to 
Dunstaffnage chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2010 10/136 
A diver and his buddy completed a wreck dive to a maximum 
depth of 22m and a total duration of 38 min. The dive had 
involved a slow descent due to one diver having difficulty in 
clearing ears and it took almost 9 min to reach the maximum 
depth. A current required the divers to hold onto the shotline 
throughout the descent. A normal ascent up a shotline with a 3 
min safety stop at 5m was conducted without incident. On 
surfacing the more experienced diver took over coxswain duties 
to allow others to dive. After 10 to 15 min on the surface the 
diver noticed a pain in his left shoulder as if he had been 
punched. There were no other symptoms but movement made 
the pain worse. The diver was moved to another boat and given 
100% oxygen and isotonic drinks. A neurological examination 
revealed no problems and checks revealed no rash. Once all 
divers had been recovered the boats returned to shore and a 
local recompression facility was contacted who advised 
attendance for further assessment. DCI was diagnosed and the 
diver received recompression treatment that left some residual 
pain in the left shoulder. After two further treatments there was 
no further improvement and the diver was advised to continue 
with anti-inflammatory medication and avoid diving until after a 
review 4 weeks later. The diver had used nitrox 27 for the dive. 
June 2010 10/177 
A diver was on the first dive of the day having completed two 
dives the previous day without any problems. During the 
descent to a wreck at a depth of 34m the diver experienced no 
problems. At 34m the diver experienced a sudden shortness of 
breath. The diver switched to his second regulator on an 
independent cylinder but still felt unable to breathe and became 
anxious. The diver rested on the seabed and swapped 
regulators, in doing so he raised a cloud of silt and lost sight of 
his buddy. The diver decided to ascend and did not complete 
any decompression stops. Total dive time was 7 min. On 
surfacing the difficulty breathing continued and the diver was 
recovered to the charter boat and placed on oxygen for 30 min. 
His breathing recovered to near normal levels very quickly. As 
the diver was not experiencing any symptoms of DCI he chose 
not to return to shore at that time. His equipment was checked 
and no defects were found. On returning to shore a local doctor 
was consulted about his shortness of breath. The doctor 
suspected pneumonia and found evidence of a skin DCI. The 
diver was again placed on oxygen and sent to hospital. The 
diver subsequently received recompression treatment. 
June 2010 10/324 
Holyhead Coastguard was contacted by a dive support vessel 
reporting they had a diver aboard who had made a rapid ascent 
from 40m and was suffering from suspected DCI, the diver had 
made a dive to the same depth 90 min earlier. Holyhead 
Coastguard tasked RAF rescue helicopter R-122 to airlift the 
casualty to Murrayfield Hospital. Vessels from the Liverpool Bay 
oil and gas field offered assistance; the vessel VOS Inspirer 
launched an RHIB to stand by the dive boat. The helicopter was 
met at the HLS by Holyoak CRT. The casualty was the skipper 
of the vessel; the remaining persons (dive charter) were not 
confident to handle the vessel and were escorted into port by 
another vessel.  (Coastguard report).

A diver suffered back pain, tingling fingers with pain and could 
not support his own weight. The pain came on after carrying 
heavy equipment after a dive to 30m for 29 min. Oxygen was 
given and he was advised to go to chamber to rule out DCI. 
June 2010 10/138 
A diver suffered symptoms of DCI after a rapid ascent from a 
40m dive 15 miles offshore. The diver was the boat's skipper 
and no one else onboard had experience of steering the boat. A 
rescue helicopter airlifted the diver to a recompression chamber 
where he was treated. (Media report). 
June 2010 10/139 
A diver had conducted a dive to 20m for 40 min 20 hours 
previously and carried out a dive to 33m for 22 min using nitrox 
32. At the end of the dive the diver deployed a delayed SMB 
from a depth of 27m. During deployment the line became 
tangled around the diver's hand and pulled the diver to the 
surface. Once back in the boat the diver felt pain in the right 
shoulder and chest. The diver was placed on 100% oxygen and 
the Coastguard was called. The Coastguard tasked a helicopter 
to airlift the diver to a recompression chamber. (Coastguard 
report). 
June 2010 10/172 
A diver and his buddy conducted a series of dives as part of a 
club trip. Day 1 27m 42 min nitrox 31,  18m 58 min nitrox 25; 
Day 2 33m 37 min nitrox 31, 36m 27 min nitrox 25; Day 3 43m 
39 min on nitrox 23. Immediately after surfacing from the last 
dive the diver felt pain in his right shoulder. After 15 min the 
pain did not improve and spread to the right side of his neck. 
The diver went onto oxygen whilst returning to shore where an 
ambulance took him to the recompression chamber. The diver 
received recompression treatment which left some pain and a 
general ache around his shoulder. The diver was discharged 
and advised not to dive for four weeks and advised to take 
painkillers until the ache settled down.

Portland Coastguard tasked Portland Coastguard helicopter R-
106 to airlift a diver suffering from suspected DCI from a dive 
support vessel, the helicopter was met at the HLS by Poole 
Coastguard team who assisted with the transfer to the 
ambulance, and the casualty was taken to Poole recompression 
chamber.  (Coastguard report).

A diver using a rebreather made a rapid ascent from a 40m 
dive. The diver was airlifted to a recompression chamber for 
observation and possible treatment for DCI. (Coastguard & 
media report). 
July 2010 10/156 
Towards the end of a dive to a wreck at 30m a diver felt he was 
becoming light. He picked up rocks to compensate and aborted 
the dive. At 20m he could not control buoyancy without finning 
down. He held onto his buddy for support but at 6m the pair 
separated and the diver ascended rapidly to the surface without 
completing 10 min of required decompression stops. The diver 
was recovered into the boat and given oxygen and fluids and 
the Coastguard was contacted due to reported pains in the 
diver's calf muscles. The Coastguard tasked a rescue 
helicopter and the diver was airlifted to a recompression 
chamber for treatment. 
July 2010 10/161 
A diver complained of elbow joint pain following a dive to 46m 
for a bottom time of 30 min and a total duration of 60 min. The 
diver was placed on oxygen, the Coastguard was contacted and 
the diver was airlifted for recompression treatment. The diver 
had been treated for DCI six years previously. (Coastguard & 
media reports). 
July 2010 10/194 
A diver conducted six dives over three days with maximum 
depths between 25 and 35m and decompression stops of up to 
2 min plus safety stops. All dives were uneventful and 
conducted within computer limits. Approximately 90 min after 
the final dive DCI symptoms started to appear. Initially the diver 
experienced an aura in her left eye including some loss of 
vision. Initially this was put down to a migraine which the diver 
had a history of. Discomfort in her right shoulder was put down 
to a pulled muscle whilst carrying equipment and was also 
ignored. About an hour later, whilst having a shower, the aura 
had reduced but an itching was felt and inspection identified 
three itchy rashes. The diver became concerned about DCI and 
placed herself on oxygen and within half an hour the aura and 
one of the rashes had disappeared. A call was made for advice 
to a recompression chamber and they advised contacting a 
local chamber. It was out of office hours and so the local 
chamber was only dealing with emergencies. The diver did not 
feel it was an emergency situation. After a break the diver again 
breathed oxygen for 30 min after which the remaining rashes 
had almost disappeared. The next day the diver contacted the 
local chamber who confirmed a DCI and advised a check for a 
PFO. A subsequent test confirmed the presence of a large 
PFO.

Prior to a dive a diver felt sick due to the rough surface 
conditions. Once on site he wanted to get in the water as 
quickly as possible in the hope he would feel better in the water. 
Underwater the feeling of sickness eased slightly but the diver 
was not enjoying the dive.  Despite his discomfort he continued 
with the dive because it counted towards his speciality training. 
At the end of the bottom time the diver deployed a delayed SMB 
with some difficulties which he resolved. During the ascent, at a 
depth of 5m, his computer was indicating 6 min of 
decompression stops. The diver was diving with nitrox 32 and 
should not have required stops. Due to feeling unwell he 
surfaced and missed decompression stops. Once back on the 
boat the diver collapsed and could not feel his fingers and toes. 
He was placed on oxygen and airlifted for recompression 
treatment. (Coastguard report). 
July 2010 10/337 
Stornoway Coastguard received a call on VHF from a dive 
support vessel reporting having a diver aboard suffering from 
suspected DCI, the vessel was connected with Aberdeen Royal 
infirmary and medical advice given, Stornoway Coastguard 
tasked Coastguard rescue helicopter R-100 to recover the diver 
and buddy who were taken to Dunstaffnage chamber for 
treatment. The helicopter was met by Loch Boisdale CRT who 
prepared the HLS.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2010 10/339 
Portland Coastguard tasked Coastguard helicopter R-106 to 
airlift a male diver from a dive vessel, over the wreck of the 
Salsette, 10 miles west of Portland Bill, after he started showing 
signs of DCI. He was met at Poole by a specialist dive doctor, 
South Western Ambulance and Poole Coastguard Rescue 
Team, and then taken onwards to the recompression chamber.  
(Coastguard report).

A pair of divers were ascending after an uneventful wreck dive 
to a maximum depth of 36m. At the first of three decompression 
stops at 9m one of the divers kept turning away from his buddy 
where he would normally have made eye contact. Afterwards it 
was explained that his delayed SMB line kept pulling him round. 
After surfacing the diver was very quiet and said he felt dizzy. 
His buddy instructed him to inflate his BCD more and go to the 
boat first. As the boat approached, the diver drifted past the tail 
lift and when doing so shook his head and went face down. His 
buddy swam after him and turned him over and pulled him to 
the tail lift. At this point the diver's body had gone completely 
stiff which created great difficulty in recovering the diver onto 
the lift. The skipper of the boat and the buddy managed to get 
the diver onto the lift and recovered into the boat. The buddy 
was then recovered into the boat and given the oxygen kit by 
the skipper who then alerted the Coastguard. The skipper had 
to recover other divers who were surfacing. The buddy started 
to administer oxygen to the troubled diver but it became 
apparent that resuscitation was required and the buddy started 
to administer CPR. CPR was successful and the diver was 
airlifted to a recompression chamber where he was 
recompressed and, within 3 hours, was able to stand and 
reported feeling normal. The diver was kept in hospital 
overnight and received eight further treatments with a further 
three expected. The diver was advised to refrain from diving 
until the cause of the incident could be found and addressed. 
July 2010 10/349 
Shetland Coastguard evacuated a diver suffering from 
suspected DCI from Scrabster, the casualty boarded a ferry to 
travel to the mainland to seek treatment, a medical link call was 
established and Thurso lifeboat was tasked but stood down. 
Paramedics met the casualty on the ferry, the casualty was 
later seen at Stromness chamber.  (Coastguard & RNLI

Clyde Coastguard was alerted to a diver who had completed a 
dive to 30m for 27 min, he had missed 1 min of stops and 
surfaced with a headache, the diver was given 100% oxygen 
and a medical link call was established with Aberdeen Royal 
Infirmary, the diver was taken by ambulance to Millport chamber 
for treatment, Cumbrae Coastguard CRT assisted with the 
transfer.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2010 10/181 
Three divers conducted a dive on a wreck to a maximum depth 
of 30m. One diver had deployed a delayed SMB and during the 
ascent at a depth of 8m another of the three became 
disoriented and sank back down to 12m. The third diver 
descended and checked she was alright. The diver then put air 
into her wing but was then unable to dump it. As she 
approached the first diver at 9m she held on to him and 
dragged him to the surface. Both divers regained control and 
descended back down to 10m. During the descent the second 
diver started to drop rapidly and experienced pain in her ears 
and felt as if she was spinning out of control. She regained 
control and both divers completed 22 min of decompression 
stops. Once out of the water and back onboard the boat both 
divers were given oxygen for the rapid ascent whilst the boat 
returned to shore. As they neared the shore it was discovered 
that the second diver's computer had locked out. The divers 
were taken to a recompression chamber by car and both were 
given recompression treatment. 
July 2010 10/213 
A diver and her buddy conducted two dives in a day. This was 
the diver's first dives for a few months. Dive 1 24m for 32 min 
including a 3 min safety stop at 6m, Dive 2 15m for 32 min 
including a 3 min safety stop at 3m. Due to strong currents both 
dives had involved quite a lot of finning. Following the second 
dive, the divers walked up a fairly steep hill, the diver felt very 
short of breath and had to stop half way up but breathing 
returned to normal after reaching the top. The diver went to bed 
at 10pm but awoke at 4am very short of breath and with pains 
in her chest and back. The diver assumed she had pulled a 
muscle. The next morning a recompression chamber was 
contacted and they advised going to hospital for an x-ray which 
she did but it showed clear. During examination the diver 
noticed her legs felt leaden, generally felt poorly and also noted 
a tingling in one arm. This progressed to having no feeling in 
her left arm and the diver was administered oxygen by hospital 
staff. The diver was transferred to a recompression chamber 
where she received recompression treatment after which she 
was allowed home. However symptoms reoccurred and the 
diver received two further recompression treatments and was 
undergoing further medical treatment six weeks after the 
incident.

A pair of divers had completed one dive the previous day. One 
of the divers had borrowed a drysuit from another diver. 
Following a dive to a wreck at a maximum depth of 30m for 40 
min the divers paused for 30 sec at 8m. Their computers 
indicated 9 min of stops required at 3m. The first diver was 
unable to stop at 3m and continued direct to the surface due to 
difficulties dumping air from the unfamiliar drysuit. Back 
onboard the boat the first diver began displaying symptoms of 
DCI and both divers were airlifted to shore and taken by 
ambulance to a recompression chamber where the first diver 
received recompression treatment. 
July 2010 10/185 
A diver had completed a dive to a maximum depth of 24m for a 
total duration of 44 min including a 3 min safety stop at 6m. 20 
min after surfacing the diver complained of an ache in his right 
arm. The Coastguard was contacted and the diver was airlifted 
to a recompression chamber for treatment. (Coastguard report). 
July 2010 10/186 
Two divers from the same group made rapid uncontrolled 
ascents following a second dive of the day on a wreck at 33m. 
The first diver had deployed his delayed SMB and started his 
ascent when he got caught in the bubbles of another diver, 
became disorientated and went direct to the surface missing 
decompression stops. The second diver had been diving as 
part of a group of four but became separated from them on the 
wreck due to it being dark and visibility of around 3-4m. The 
diver did a circuit of the bow and conning tower and then 
deployed his delayed SMB and began a slow normal ascent to 
around 20m when the ascent became more rapid and the diver 
ascended to the surface without stops and his computer locked 
out. Both divers were recovered and placed on oxygen by the 
charter boat skipper although neither exhibited symptoms. The 
Coastguard was contacted and both divers were airlifted to a 
recompression chamber for assessment.  Both divers were 
reported to have been suffering from spinal DCI.  (Coastguard 
report).

A diver had conducted two dives the previous day without 
incident. The diver and her buddy had an uneventful dive on the 
second day on a wreck to a maximum depth of 30m. The pair 
began a normal ascent but at 20m the diver started to lose 
buoyancy control. It later was discovered that the diver had lost 
a 4kg weight from a weight pouch in her BCD. Her buddy tried 
to assist in slowing the ascent by making himself heavy and 
holding on to her. The diver was swimming down to try and 
compensate but became tangled in the delayed SMB line. At 
7m her buddy freed the diver from the line. The diver then let go 
of her buddy and made a feet first rapid ascent to the surface. 
Her buddy completed 4 min of decompression stops and then 
surfaced to see the diver being recovered into the boat. The 
diver informed the crew that she had experienced a fast ascent 
and missed decompression stops. She de-kitted, oxygen was

A group of five divers were conducting the third dive of a deep 
dive speciality course; this dive was to a maximum depth of 
37m. Towards the end of the dive the instructor deployed a 
delayed SMB and all divers started to ascend. At 21m the reel 
line snapped. A second instructor in the group took one of the 
students and they performed a normal ascent. The first 
instructor deployed his reserve delayed SMB but in doing so 
sank again to a depth of 36m before he could deploy it fully. On 
checking air he found that one of the students was down to 50 
bar, whilst the other had 100 bar. The instructor gave the first 
student his regulator on a long hose and switched to his 
backup. The first diver was reluctant to take the air source and 
started to panic. An ascent was started but as the divers 
ascended at slightly different rates the alternate air source 
regulator started to pull from the first student's mouth and he 
didn't dump air from his BCD fast enough. Buoyancy control 
was lost and all three divers ascended direct to the surface 
missing decompression stops. Their total dive time was 27 min. 
On recovery into the boat one diver complained of chest pains 
and feeling dizzy. The Coastguard was called and the three 
divers were airlifted to a recompression chamber for treatment. 
(Coastguard report). 
August 2010 10/206 
A diver conducted a dive on the second day of a diving trip to a 
maximum depth of 37m and a total duration of 60 min using 
nitrox 25 as his dive gas. The diver completed decompression 
stops of 19m 3 min, 11m 2 min & 6m 11 min as required by his 
computer which was set to include deep stops. All stops were 
conducted using a nitrox 50 decompression mix. On surfacing 
the diver felt a slight pain in the right shoulder which became 
more noticeable whilst waiting to be picked up. On recovery into 
the dive boat via a diver lift the diver noted a lack of strength in 
the shoulder but no additional pain. He alerted the crew and 
was de-kitted, laid down in the cabin and given 100% oxygen 
and fluids. The Coastguard was called and it was confirmed that 
the diver would be met by an ambulance at the harbour. The 
diver was transferred by ambulance to a recompression 
chamber where a doctor confirmed DCI and the diver received 
recompression treatment with a complete resolution of 
symptoms. The diver was advised not to dive for four weeks.

On a weekend charter a diver conducted two dives on the first 
day; 27m for 39 min and 30m for 37 min, both including a 3 min 
safety stop at 6m. On the second day he conducted a dive to 
25m for 42 min, again including a 3 min safety stop. The dive 
was without incident and within normal descent and ascent 
rates. After returning to the shore and unloading equipment the 
diver felt generally unwell and had pain, numbness and tingling 
down his left leg. The leg symptoms were attributed to a historic 
spinal problem. The pain eased during the surface interval but 
the diver declined a second dive from a boat but felt well 
enough to do a shallow shore dive to a maximum of 12m for a 
duration of 59 min with an average depth of 5m. The diver 
continued his holiday and walked approximately 8 miles along a 
coastal path the next day. Travelling home the following day the 
diver experienced numbness in both legs. He consulted a diving 
doctor when the numbness persisted the following day and was 
advised to attend a chamber for a medical examination. He was 
diagnosed with DCI and received recompression treatment with 
complete resolution of symptoms.

A diver and her buddy conducted a dive to 27m. The diver 
checked her gas contents at one point in the dive and had 100 
bar remaining. The divers continued the dive for a further 5 min 
by which time the contents had fallen to 50 bar. The divers 
started to ascend with the diver using her gas quite quickly. At 
6m the diver ran out of gas and went slowly to the surface 
missing 5 min of decompression stops. Her buddy remained at 
6m to complete his stops. Once surfaced the diver alerted the 
dive boat.  She was recovered from the water and placed on 
oxygen. The diver was returned to the shore and driven to a 
recompression chamber where she received recompression 
treatment for pain in the joints and a headache. The equipment 
was tested the following day and no faults were found but on 
refilling the cylinder the valve was found to have worked loose 
and was leaking.

A diver conducted his deepest dive ever whilst using a second 
hand wing that he had not used before. The diver and an 
instructor conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 30m. As the 
pair reached 18m the diver tried to dump air from the wing by 
pulling on the hose but this type of wing did not have that 
facility. It did not occur to the diver to try other means of 
dumping gas. The diver made an uncontrolled ascent from 18m 
to the surface with a total dive time of 30 min. The diver was 
recovered to a boat and monitored for symptoms but none 
appeared. It was decided not to put him on oxygen at that time.

Injury / Illness 
 
 
October 2009  10/011 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 20m for a 
duration of 40 min. After the dive he reported having experienced 
symptoms similar to narcosis towards the end of the dive. He 
indicated that he had started taking steroids a few days earlier 
and suggested that this might have contributed to the symptoms 
experienced. After a surface interval of 2 hours 9 min a second 
dive was undertaken to a maximum depth of 22m. During this 
dive the diver indicated that he was 'not OK' and his buddy 
offered a nitrox 40 mix for him to breathe to see if this would 
alleviate the narcosis-like symptoms. The diver took four or five 
breaths of the nitrox mix and then switched back to his own 
breathing supply (air). The diver then became unresponsive and 
his buddy began raising him to the surface using a controlled 
buoyant lift. The unresponsive diver was breathing from his own 
regulator until the pair reached a depth of 6m at which point he 
began to show signs of coming round but started to lose the grip 
on his mouthpiece. The buddy decided to make a faster ascent 
to the surface. On the surface the troubled diver was responsive 
and asking questions but was unaware of what had happened. 
The buddy towed the diver to shore allowing him to breathe his 
nitrox 40. After recovery 100% oxygen and water were provided. 
The diver stated he had taken two steroids 20 min prior to the 
dive. Medical advice was sought and the diver advised not to 
take steroids 48 hours prior to diving. 
October 2009 10/017 
A dive RHIB called the Coastguard on VHF radio reporting a 
diver who had surfaced from a wreck dive and was bleeding from 
the ear. The diver was airlifted to shore and taken by ambulance 
to a hyperbaric chamber for assessment. The diver had made a 
rapid descent from 15m to 27m and had burst his eardrum. No 
recompression was required and the diver was released home. 
(Coastguard report). 
October 2009 10/046 
A diver entered the water and after a short surface swim began 
to feel unwell and aborted the dive. On leaving the water the 
diver was breathless and overexerted and so a 999 call was 
made. The diver was given the all clear by a paramedic. 
October 2009 10/020 
A diver and his buddy on a dive to a maximum depth of 41m 
spotted a large anglerfish 20 min into the dive. The pair wrestled 
with the fish and after 5 min sent it to the surface. The diver then 
inhaled and got only a quarter of a breath and no more. The 
depth at this point was 36m, dive time 25 min and his computer 
showed 14 min of decompression required. The diver was using 
manifolded twin 7 litre cylinders. He tried to check and open the 
manifold but it would not move and so he assumed it was open 
and he was out of gas. He did not alert his buddy who was diving 
with a rebreather. The diver made a free ascent to the surface 
taking approximately one minute to ascend. On surfacing he was 
recovered to the boat and placed on oxygen. He refused the 
offer to be met by an ambulance on regaining the shore as he 
showed no immediate symptoms of DCI. During the night the 
diver awoke with wheezing, tight chest and difficulty breathing. 
He waited until morning and then contacted a hyperbaric centre 
who advised attending A & E. At hospital he was treated for lung 
inflammation and advised to take it easy for a few days. He 
refused to stay in hospital for observation. No symptoms of DCI 
were experienced. A subsequent examination of the diver's 
equipment revealed that the manifold had in fact been closed 
and he had one cylinder of gas remaining. 
October 2009 10/023 
A diver felt unwell whilst kitting up and decided not to dive. His 
buddy joined another pair of divers who were ready at the same 
time. After the divers had entered the water the diver who had 
been unwell felt better and stood up, he then passed out and 
was unconscious for a few minutes during which time the boat 
skipper called for a lifeboat. The lifeboat attended and the diver 
was checked by a doctor and taken to hospital for checks. The 
diver was found to have been taking painkillers for a knee injury 
and had taken a small amount of alcohol with them the night 
before. The diver was found to have been suffering from severe 
dehydration. 
October 2009 10/028 
A diver who had not been diving collapsed onboard a charter 
boat.  A 'Mayday' call was made and a lifeboat was launched.

panicked after 23 min and made a rapid ascent from a depth of 
14m. The diver was reported to have been coughing up blood 
and was taken by ambulance to A&E for a chest x-ray and was 
released later the same day. 
November 2009 10/029 
A lifeboat was launched to assist a diver who had got into 
difficulties whilst diving a wreck. The diver was recovered 
unconscious onto the charter boat he had been diving from and 
then transferred first to the lifeboat and then to a rescue 
helicopter, which airlifted him to the local hospital. Once his 
condition had been stabilised he was transferred to a larger 
regional hospital to recover. 
November 2009 10/031 
A student and instructor had completed a dive on a wreck and 
left to swim along the bottom back to the shore when the student 
had 100 bar remaining in their cylinder. As they left the wreck the 
student banged his knee on the side of the wreck but did not 
inform the instructor. Due to the pain the student's breathing rate 
increased and the student ran out of air 4-5 min later. The 
instructor provided an alternate source and an uneventful ascent 
using the alternative air source was carried out taking 4 min from 
20 m to the surface including a pause at 6m. At the surface the 
student manually inflated his BCD and the pair swam back to 
shore. By the time they exited the water the pain in the student's 
knee had gone. 
January 2010 10/050 
A pair of divers enjoyed an uneventful a dive to a maximum 
depth of 28m with a gradual ascent back up an underwater slope 
for a total dive time of 40 min including safety stops. The divers 
were fine after the dive but, after a scramble out at the exit point, 
one of the divers, who was wearing twin 10 litre cylinders, felt 
nauseous when he got back to his vehicle. The diver removed 
his equipment but, after standing up quite quickly, fell to the 
ground. The diver then reports to feeling fine again apart from 
being cold after the dive. As a precaution the diver self

A diver descended at a normal rate to a maximum depth of 17m 
with no problems. On the bottom his mask kept filling with water. 
The diver repeatedly tried to clear the mask but was getting 
water at the back of his throat. The diver became anxious and 
made a faster than normal ascent. On surfacing the diver had 
bleeding from his right ear and difficulty breathing. The diver was 
taken to hospital by helicopter and was checked out by staff from 
a recompression chamber and A&E. The diver was discharged 
the same day with slight deafness and was awaiting a referral to 
an ENT specialist.

A diver had trouble clearing her ears around 23m during a 
descent to the seabed at 27m. The diver felt able to continue the 
dive. During the ascent the diver felt in control of her buoyancy 
until reaching 11m when she felt unable to slow down the ascent 
and continued up to the surface missing the dive computer's 
indicated safety stops. On surfacing the diver felt pain in her right 
ear. On recovery to the boat the diver was placed on 100% 
oxygen and monitored. On return to shore a recompression 
chamber was contacted and the diver was advised to attend for 
an assessment. En route to the chamber the diver developed a 
pain in her shoulder. The diver received a precautionary 
treatment in the chamber but there was no change in the 
shoulder pain and the diver was released with a diagnosis of 
muscular pain and an ear barotrauma.

cease diving for a week. The second diver indicated on day five 
of the course that his ears were 'sticky' and he had decided not 
to do the final dive of the course. He did not seek medical advice 
as he had no pain but felt unable to clear his ears and had 
experienced some minor discomfort on previous dives. 
April 2010 10/280 
Forth Coastguard received a call reporting a dive boat that had 
returned to shore and had a diver who had suddenly become

report). 
April 2010 10/111 
A diver had completed a 31 min dive to a maximum depth of 6m. 
On surfacing the diver struggled to breathe and complained of a 
tight chest. The diver was given 100% oxygen but did not 
improve and so a 999 call was made. The diver was taken by 
ambulance to hospital where it was discovered that he had 
suffered a spontaneous pneumothorax a couple of days earlier. 
Diving had made the condition worse. 
April 2010 10/091 
A pair of divers entered the water to dive close to a fort structure 
from a charter vessel but were unable to descend. One diver 
was recovered without problems using the boat's stern lift. The 
second diver got onto the lift but the boat had drifted close to the 
wall of the fort. The skipper attempted to push the boat off and in 
doing so slipped and fell onto the diver on the lift. The skipper 
grazed his leg. The diver suffered pain in his neck and 
shoulders. During the recovery of the rest of the dive party the 
diver also became cold. The diver was taken to hospital by 
ambulance for x-rays and a check-over and was discharged the 
same day. 
May 2010 10/083 
A pair of divers completed an uneventful shore dive to a 
maximum depth of 14m for a duration of 20 min. On surfacing 
one of the divers had difficulty catching his breath and started to 
panic. His buddy started towing him to shore and this was 
reported to the Coastguard. A rescue helicopter was tasked but 
then stood down when it was clear that both divers were safely 
ashore and that neither had experienced a fast ascent. 
(Coastguard report). 
May 2010 10/101 
An instructor and two students conducted two training dives of 
7m for 8 min and, 94 min later, to 19m for 18 min with no 
problems reported. After returning home one of the students 
contacted the club training officer 3 hours after the last dive. He 
reported symptoms of a rash on the back of his hand and 'pins 
and needles' in the hand. The diver was advised to contact the 
DCI helpline and he was advised to go to immediately to a 
recompression facility. The diver attended a recompression 
chamber and was recompressed. There were no changes in 
symptoms and it was suggested that the symptoms may be due 
to an allergy or some other cause. 
May 2010 10/102 
A diving charter vessel called the Coastguard asking for a 
connect call with a recompression chamber for advice. A diver 
had descended down to 30m and then come straight back up. 
The diver complained of a tight throat and was severely out of 
breath. It took 6 min to get his breath back. The diver also 
complained of pain in the shoulder. The diver was advised that it 
was not a DCI and that on return to shore he seek further 
medical advice. (Coastguard report). 
May 2010 10/244

A group of three divers were preparing to dive from a 7m RHIB. 
A shotline had been deployed and the divers prepared to enter 
the water two from the same side of the RHIB and one from the 
other. On the signal to enter the water one of the two divers on 
the same side entered the water ahead of the other. As he 
surfaced he was hit on the forehead by the left hand cylinder of 
his buddy's twin-set. The first diver signalled for assistance and 
was recovered back into the RHIB. First aid was applied to stop 
bleeding and the diver was returned to shore and taken by 
vehicle to hospital for treatment. 
June 2010 10/123 
A diver had completed a dive the day before the incident to 30m 
for a total dive time of 10 min. On the day of the incident the 
diver entered the water with her buddy to dive a wreck. The diver 
experienced a free flow from her octopus regulator. The charter 
boat she was diving from had just moved away when she waved 
from the buoy marking the wreck. The skipper came alongside 
her and lowered the dive lift ladder. The diver looked very 
panicked. The skipper told the diver to hold on to the ladder but 
she was unresponsive. The skipper instructed her a number of 
times how to use the lift. When asked if she understood she said 
'No' and then said she was exhausted. The skipper of another 
charter vessel with a stern lift then positioned his boat alongside 
and assisted the diver onto the lift by standing on the lift himself. 
The diver was recovered from the water and subsequently 
airlifted to hospital by helicopter. The diver is reported to have 
swallowed water whilst panicking on the surface. (Coastguard 
report). 
June 2010 10/311 
Dive boat reported a diver suffering from possible DCI off 
Lossiemouth Harbour, Moray Firth. Diver met by Lossiemouth 
Coastguard rescue team and an ambulance on entrance to 
harbour and was transported to Dr Grays Hospital, Elgin where it 
was assessed he did not need a recompression chamber.  
(Coastguard report). 
June 2010 10/122 
A diver surfaced from a dive to a maximum depth of 40m for a 
total dive time of 80 min and having completed 37 min of 
decompression stops. The diver was using a rebreather with 
trimix 8/42 as the diluent gas. On returning to the dive boat using 
a diver lift the diver complained of feeling unwell, dizzy and sick. 
He reported that he had begun to feel ill during the 
decompression stops, feeling sick and dizzy when he moved his 
head. The diver was de-kitted, sat down and placed on 100% 
oxygen for 45 min. During this time the diver became very cold 
and white on a couple of occasions.  Initially he spoke 
incoherently and was very out of breath. Some improvement was 
seen after 10 min on oxygen and then fluids were given and the 
diver continued to improve. The Coastguard was called and they 
arranged for the diver to be transferred to a recompression 
chamber by helicopter. The diver was diagnosed with a mild 
inner ear barotrauma but did not require recompression. 
June 2010 10/318 
A dive support boat called 'Mayday' reporting to Falmouth 
Coastguard that they had two divers aboard having made a rapid 
ascent from 40m; they had suffered flooding of a full face mask, 
attempted to switch to an auxiliary feed but failed. Making an 
emergency ascent they were recovered breathless and bleeding 
from the eyes and were suffering from shock. Falmouth 
Coastguard scrambled navy helicopter R-193 who airlifted the 
two casualties to DDRC in Plymouth for treatment.  (Coastguard 
report). 
June 2010 10/133 
A diver experienced acute ear pain following a dive to 50m using 
trimix. On returning to shore the diver was transferred to hospital 
for treatment. The diver has a history of ear problems including 
an operation involving the reconstruction of the inner ear. 
(Coastguard report). 
June 2010 10/252 
A pair of divers conducted a dive at an inland site. During the 
descent one of the divers had problems clearing his ears at 6m 
and again at 12m but they eventually cleared. At about 16m the 
diver's buddy signalled him to go in the direct of one of the site 
features but received no response and the diver continued a 
slow descent to the bottom. On the bottom the diver was upright 
but his eyes were wide and staring and he did not respond to 
signals. His buddy took hold of him and inflated the diver's BCD 
but the air escaped immediately due to the pressure exerted on 
the inflation hose activating the dump built into the top of the 
BCD hose. The buddy managed to get sufficient air in to initiate 
a lift and finned to aid the ascent. On the surface he made the 
diver buoyant and filled his own BCD then towed the diver to the 
shore where others assisted in the recovery from the water. The 
diver was checked out and recovered but could not remember 
what had happened. 
June 2010 10/327 
Falmouth Coastguard was alerted to a diver who had surfaced 
from a 9m shore dive for 30 min coughing up blood, 
Porthoustock CRT attended and assisted the casualty into the air 
ambulance for onward transportation to the DDRC Plymouth.  
(Coastguard report). 
July 2010 10/200 
During a dive to 37m for 50 min a diver experienced pain on 
ascent at a depth of approximately 20m. After the dive the dive 
manager noticed blood on the outside of the diver's ear and the 
diver complained of a loss of hearing. On return to the shore the 
diver had some minor pain and discomfort but his orientation 
was good. The diver consulted his doctor who confirmed he had 
perforated his eardrum. Five weeks later the diver's ear had 
recovered and he had returned to diving. 
July 2010 10/163 
Whilst a diver was fitting his fins in preparation for diving from an 
RHIB he slipped at an angle and his cylinder landed on the hand 
of another person onboard trapping this person's hand between 
the cylinder and the tube. After the divers had entered the water 
the injured person was sick and complained of the pain getting 
worse. Medical attention was sought and the diver diagnosed 
with injured tendons in his hand. 
July 2010 10/212 
A diver was returning onto a dive boat via a diver lift when the 
skipper dropped the lift straight down to it's lowered position 
before the diver had stepped off onto the deck. The diver was in 
full kit and suffered jarring which caused ligament damage to the 
right knee. The diver had also removed her regulator and 
swallowed a small amount of water causing her to cough. The 
diver's buddy who was still in the water went to her assistance. A 
diver from another boat also swam over to assist and the diver 
was towed back to the charter boat and recovered using the 
diver lift without further incident. The diver was treated at a local 
medical centre before returning home. 
July 2010 10/174 
A diver conducted two dives during the day. Dive 1 28m for 30 
min including a 3 min safety stop, 3 hours later Dive 2 20m for 40 

 
 
NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2010    
?BSAC - 2010   21 
min including a 3 min safety stop. On returning to harbour the 
diver removed her drysuit and complained of feeling hot. After 20 
min she felt dizzy, had a headache, joint pain and loss of energy. 
Her dive group laid her down, administered oxygen and called an 
ambulance. The ambulance crew checked her over and allowed 
her to travel back to a local campsite with the advice to seek 
medical help if further symptoms appear. No further ill effects 
were experienced and the diver believes she was dehydrated. 
July 2010 10/165 
A diver conducted a series of shallow dives, 8m for 30 min, 10m 
for 40 min & 12m for 40 min. After getting back onboard the 
charter vessel following the final dive the diver started coughing 
and retching. He had enlarged tonsils and had trouble breathing 
through his mouth. The diver was airlifted to shore and checked 
out by a specialist dive doctor and an ambulance crew. The diver 
was diagnosed with inflammation at the top of the throat and that 
it was not a diving problem. (Coastguard report). 
July 2010 10/343 
Forth Coastguard received a call from Ambulance control 
advising of a diving casualty at St Abbs. A link call between the 
casualty and the dive doctor at Aberdeen could not be made due 
to bad signal and a decision was made by the ambulance 
technician that medical evacuation was not necessary as it 
appeared to be a viral infection. Rescue helicopter 177 and 
Eyemouth Coastguard rescue team were stood down and 
returned to station.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2010 10/169 
A diver carried out an uneventful dive on a wreck to a maximum 
depth of 17m for 61 min total dive time including a safety stop 
but no mandatory stops. During the boat journey back to shore 
the diver experienced some numbness and tingling in his legs 
and then his back. After returning to shore and unloading 
equipment the diver asked to use oxygen as a precaution. The 
diver breathed 100% oxygen for 15 min after which the tingling 
eased. No further symptoms were experienced and no further 
action was deemed necessary. The symptoms were attributed to 
rough seas and a challenging RHIB journey to the dive site. 
July 2010 10/184 
Whilst transferring equipment onto a dive boat a diver fell down 
the gap between the pontoon and the boat. The diver suffered a 
severe blow to the lower shin and minimal bleeding. Attendance 
at A&E for an x-ray revealed no broken bones and the diver was 
advised to rest the leg. 
August 2010 10/421 
Lifeboat launched to help diver with illness.  Person brought in.  
(RNLI report). 
August 2010 10/235 
Following a pool session a diver slipped down two stairs on to 
the poolside injuring her left hip and grazing her left elbow. The 
diver was in pain and unable to be moved and an ambulance 
was called and transported the diver to hospital where an x-ray 
revealed no broken bones. The diver was admitted to hospital 
and was awaiting a scan. 
August 2010 10/248 
Following a pool session a diver stood on a low window ledge to 
hang up a T-shirt to dry. He slipped and caught his foot on a 
broken window tile cutting and bruising the skin. The diver was 
advised to attend A&E due to the severity of the injury. 
August 2010 10/203 
A student diver and her instructor had successfully completed 
the student's first sea dive to a maximum depth of 15m and a 
total dive time of 33 min including a 3 min safety stop. The 
student was positioning herself on the diver lift of the charter 
boat they were diving from and gripped the track. The lift was 
actuated before the student was fully on it and her hand was 
caught between the lift basket and the track and crushed. The 
wound was cleaned and two plasters were applied; once ashore 
a bandage was applied. On return home the student visited A&E 
and x-rays confirmed there were no breaks. 
August 2010 10/378 
Liverpool Coastguard coordinated the recovery by ambulance of 
a diver suffering from suspected DCI following a dive to 41m, to 
a recompression chamber. Possible jelly fish sting on way up 
that he may have reacted to, so may not be DCI.  (Coastguard 
report). 
August 2010 10/383 
Falmouth Coastguard tasked Falmouth lifeboat to a dive RHIB 
which had a diver aboard who had surfaced and swallowed or 
inhaled a lot of water at the surface, the lifeboat brought the 
casualty back to Falmouth where it was met by a waiting 
ambulance for onward transportation to Royal Cornwall Hospital 
Treliske.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
August 2010 10/215 
A diver from another boat was seen being towed on the surface 
and the pair were asked if they needed any assistance. The 
person towing declined and dismissed any offer of help. There 
was no mention made of the third person who had been in the 
party but was no longer with them. A few moments later a shout 
for help was heard as the diver being towed had stopped 
breathing. The pair were recovered aboard a charter boat and 
resuscitation efforts commenced. A doctor onboard coordinated 
the efforts whilst giving chest compressions. After about 5 min 
the diver started breathing again and he was placed on oxygen. 
During this time a further call for help was heard from a diver 
assisting a 12 year old boy whose BCD was not giving him 
proper support. Another diver entered the water and assisted the 
recovery of the boy into the RHIB that he had been diving from. 
He was later transferred to the charter boat and comforted as it 
was his father who had been resuscitated. The father and son 
were transferred to hospital by a helicopter. 
August 2010 10/217 
A diver and two buddies conducted a wreck dive to a maximum 
depth of 26m. During the dive the diver was seen to be over-
weighted but he coped with buoyancy control throughout the 
dive. The divers completed a 3 min safety stop at 6m. On 
reaching the surface the diver inflated his BCD but his head 
would not clear the water due to the excess weight he was 
carrying and the BCD being too large. The water was choppy 
and the diver started to panic and let go of his regulator. The 
diver inhaled water as a wave washed over him and he grabbed 
one of his buddies. The buddy tried to calm him down and 
instructed him to replace his regulator which he did. The buddy 
then towed him towards the charter boat but as he approached it 
became apparent that the diver had become unconscious. The 
buddies, together with the boat skipper, managed to manoeuvre 
the diver onto the diver lift and raise him to deck level and 
started CPR. Other boats came to assist and the Coastguard 
was called for assistance. After about 5 min of CPR the diver 
started breathing again normally and was administered oxygen. 
The diver was taken to the shore and transferred by ambulance 
to hospital where he was kept overnight for observation and then 
discharged.

Forth Coastguard received a routine call from a dive boat 
reporting a diver onboard suffering from suspected DCI with 
pains in his back. Whilst the vessel made her way into harbour a 
connect call was established with the dive doctor at Aberdeen. It 
later became evident that the problem was not dive related and 
after being checked over by ambulance technicians all units 
were stood down. Eyemouth Coast Rescue team in attendance. 
Safety advice given to skipper of dive boat.  (Coastguard report).

Boating & Surface Incidents 
 
 
October 2009 10/013 
A lifeboat was launched to assist divers after a member of the 
public reported that divers were at risk of being swept out to sea 
south of a harbour entrance. Two divers, who had been diving 
from the shore, were reported as having difficulty returning due 
to strong currents and offshore winds gusting to 50 knots. The 
lifeboat located two divers, recovered them aboard and returned 
them safely to shore. The lifeboat then stood by looking for two 
other divers who were yet to surface. The second pair of divers 
made their own way back to shore and landed safely with 
Coastguard assistance. 
October 2009 10/012 
A 999 call to the Coastguard was made reporting three divers 
waving and blowing whistles, trying to attract the attention of 
their support RHIB. The Coastguard scrambled a helicopter and 
called other craft in the area to assist. The helicopter, once on 
scene, spotted one diver and SMB and two other divers close to 
the shore. A local charter RHIB picked up the single diver and 
the pair of divers made the shore without assistance. The 
helicopter winch man was lowered to the beach to speak to the 
pair of divers. The divers explained that they had lost one of 
their SMBs and had been trying to attract the attention of their 
cover boat. The cover boat had moored in the next bay and it 
was not possible to establish the reason as the divers and their 
boat cover did not speak very good English. (Coastguard 
report). 
October 2009 10/254 
Portland Coastguard received a call from a dive boat reporting 
that they had broken down and were drifting and still had divers 
in the water.   Swanage AWLB & ILB were tasked to proceed to 
assist, but while they were on route the boat called back to 
advise that he had been able to get his engine started and 
return to shore without any further assistance.  (Coastguard 
report). 
October 2009 10/018 
Two divers experienced engine failure of their 6m RHIB after 
diving. The Coastguard was called in worsening weather 
conditions and RNLI all weather and inshore lifeboats were 
launched to assist. The RHIB was located 1.5 miles south east 
of the dive site and the vessel was towed to the local marina. 
(RNLI report). 
October 2009 10/255 
Humber Coastguard received a call from a dive boat reporting 
that they had broken down, but did not have divers in the water.  
However, shortly after making the call they reported back that 
they had fixed the problem and were again underway.  
(Coastguard& RNLI reports). 
October 2009 10/022 
A group of divers were returning from a wreck dive in their RHIB 
when they heard a call for help. The call came from a 50ft boat 
that was drifting dangerously close to rocks in choppy seas. The 
boat had been incapacitated due to a mooring rope fouling the 
propeller. After assisting the boat safely to shore the divers 
checked under the boat and found a rope tightly wrapped 
around the propeller shaft and they took turns in cutting it free. 
 
October 2009 10/257 
Brixham Coastguard received a call from a dive boat reporting 
they had broken down and still had two divers in the water.  
Plymouth AWLB was tasked to proceed and provide 
assistance. The divers were recovered before the lifeboat 
arrived.  On arrival the lifeboat took the divers onboard and 
towed the boat back to harbour.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
October 2009 10/259 
Falmouth Coastguard received a 999 call from a dive boat 
reporting that they had a solo diver who was 10 min overdue to 
surface. The boat had carried out a search but had been unable 
to locate him.  A broadcast was made to all boats in the area 
and Falmouth AWLB and rescue helicopter R-193 were tasked 
to commence a search.  However, before the lifeboat and 
helicopter arrived on scene, it was reported that the diver had 
been seen on the surface by a yacht.  The yacht was unable to 
recover him, so he was winched up by the rescue helicopter 
and transferred to the AWLB to be taken to the lifeboat station 
to receive medical treatment.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
October 2009 10/261 
Stornoway Coastguard received a 999 call from the shore 
contact of a dive boat reporting that they had a missing diver.   
While resources were being tasked, rescue helicopter R-100 
which was on exercise in the area was tasked to commence a 
search.  However, very shortly after, it was reported that the 
diver had been found safe and well.  (Coastguard report).

March 2010 10/071 
During a boat handling course a student was practicing high 
speed turns. The instructor was standing immediately behind 
the student issuing instructions and maintaining an all-round 
view for other craft in what could be a busy channel. The 
student made a turn that was sharper than previous turns and 
the instructor became unsteady but was holding onto a 
strongpoint so did not fall over. The student then made a turn in 
the opposite direction and hit a wave causing the already 
unstable instructor to go over the side of the boat. His lifejacket 
inflated automatically and his clothing insulated him well. The 
student manoeuvred the boat and collected the instructor at the 
first attempt. The instructor went ashore and changed clothing 
and continued with the course. 
March 2010 10/271 
Brixham Coastguard received a call from a group of dive boats 
reporting that one had broken down. They were able to make 
their own tow, so Brixham Coastguard monitored their progress 
until they reported they had arrived back in harbour safe and 
well.  (Coastguard report). 
April 2010 10/408 
Lifeboat launched to assist dive boat with engine problems.  
Craft towed in.  (RNLI report). 
April 2010 10/275 
Milford Haven Coastguard received lots of 999 calls about three 
divers who had been spotted about 400m from shore drifting 
and possibly in difficulties.  Aberystwyth ILB and rescue 
helicopter R-122 were tasked to proceed to the position and 
Aberystwyth CRT to meet with informants on the shore side.  
On arrival on scene, the CRT reported that there were in fact 
five divers in trouble and they were attempting to make their 
own way back to shore.  Two made it back and three were 
picked up by the ILB before the helicopter arrived.  The divers 
had been caught in a rip current.  They were attended to by an 
ambulance to ensure that there were no medical problems.  
(Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
April 2010 10/088 
A dive boat with six divers onboard suffered sudden engine 
failure. The boat anchored and fired red flares. A lifeboat was 
launched to assist. (RNLI and media report). 
April 2010 10/276 
Liverpool Coastguard received a call from a dive boat reporting 
two missing divers. Lifeboats from Port Erin, Port St Mary, the 
ALB from Douglas IOM, rescue helicopter R-122, the missing 
diver’s boat and one other dive boat in the area were tasked to 
search for the missing divers.  They were found by one of the 
dive boats about 20 min after they had been reported missing.  
They were spotted and picked up by their own boat.  They were 
able to complete all stops and suffered no ill effects, and 
required no medical attention.  It seems that out of three pairs 
of divers, the missing pair got swept away from the area where 
they were expected to surface and were not spotted when they 
did.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
April 2010 10/410 
Lifeboat launched to assist dive boat with engine problems.  
Craft towed in.  (RNLI report). 
April 2010 10/081 
A charter boat with ten persons onboard reported having 
suffered engine failure. An RNLI lifeboat was diverted from a 
training exercise to tow the vessel back to harbour. The 
problem was later identified as a faulty kill cord. (Coastguard 
Report). 
April 2010 10/082 
Three divers were diving from the shore and reached a 
maximum depth of 8m. During the dive the current picked up 
and one diver became separated from the other two. The diver 
surfaced safely after a total dive time of 30 min. The other 
divers when they noticed their buddy was missing looked for 
him for one minute and then surfaced after a total dive time of 
52 min and found their buddy already safely on the surface. The 
divers then tried to swim back to shore but realised that the 
current was too strong and signalled their shore cover who 
raised the alarm. The Coastguard was contacted and a local 
vessel recovered the divers and returned them to shore where 
they were met by local coast rescue officers. (Coastguard 
report). 
April 2010 10/282 
Stornoway Coastguard received a call from a boat reporting he 
had lost sight of one of his divers in fog.  A 'Mayday' broadcast 
was made, and a major search was instigated using the CRT 
and ALB from Barra, rescue helicopter R-100, another vessel 
and the boat who had the diver missing.  The diver was found 
about 20 min after being reported missing.  It seems he had 
taken a bearing and headed towards land and was found on 
some rocks, safe and well.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
May 2010 10/284 
Falmouth Coastguard received an unreadable 'Mayday' call 
which turned out to be from a dive boat in Brixham 
Coastguard's area reporting that they had engine failure and 
were taking water.  There was a dive festival taking place in the 
area, so it could have been one of several boats out.  Fowey 
AWLB, Mevagissey CRT and rescue helicopter R-193 were 
tasked to proceed.  A yacht in the vicinity responded to the 
'Mayday' call and also went to assist.  However, before the 
helicopter and lifeboat arrived, the boat was able to report they 
had made it back to shore under escort of another dive boat.  
The boat was met by the CRT back at the beach.  (Coastguard 
& RNLI reports). 
May 2010 10/286 
Brixham Coastguard received advice from the lifeguards of a 
dive boat stuck on the sand on a beach after it had been loaded 
onto a trailer following breakdown.  Tamar CRT went to the 
scene to assist with recovering the boat and trailer from the 
beach.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2010 10/288 
Brixham Coastguard received a call from a dive boat reporting 
they had engine failure and still had a diver drifting in the water.  
A yacht and a dive boat responded to the Coastguard broadcast 
requesting assistance, and the dive boat was able to recover 
the diver and return him to his own boat. Torbay lifeboat was 
sent to the assistance of the broken down boat and towed it 
back to harbour, where they were met by Torbay CRT.  
(Coastguard & RNLI reports).

The Coastguard received a call from a dive charter vessel that 
an RHIB had lost two divers. Another boat reported they had 
recovered two divers and were returning them to their RHIB. 
The divers had been diving at 12m and had intended putting up 
their SMB just before surfacing. The divers had surfaced and 
could not see their RHIB and so had swum ashore and then 
realised that their RHIB was too far away and were picked up 
by another vessel. The RHIB had been drifting with it's engine 
switched off and had drifted approximately 1 nautical mile away. 
(Coastguard report). 
June 2010 10/150 
A dive RHIB with seven divers onboard experienced severe 
flooding when the self bailer sock became detached. Temporary 
repairs were effected and the boat escorted back to harbour. 
Investigation revealed that the auxiliary engine when lowered 
was hitting the tubing and over time had knocked the tube back 
to the extent that there was nothing for the sock to locate to. 
Adjustments have been made to prevent reoccurrence. 
June 2010 10/151 
Two divers entered the water from an RHIB and began 
descending down the shotline. One of the divers became 
tangled in the trail line. The divers ascended to clear the line. At 
the same time a yacht in full sail ran over the shotline pulling 
both divers to the surface and they both bounced along the hull 
of the yacht. One diver lost her mask but the yacht made no 
attempt to stop. The RHIB recovered the divers who were both 
shaken but not injured. The yacht sailed into the distance and 
then dropped anchor. After the remaining divers in the group 
were recovered the cox drove over to the yacht and challenged 
the crew of three over the incident. None had noticed the shot, 
marked by a large tub, or the RHIB and did not know what the 
'A' flag was supposed to signal and admitted they had not been 
looking. The crew apologised to the divers concerned and 
agreed to be more observant in the future.

A 6.5m RHIB suffered engine failure, due to a split fuel pipe, 
whilst they still had two divers in the water. The skipper tried to 
contact the Coastguard via VHF radio but the radio failed due to 
a blown fuse. Contact was made using a mobile phone which 
gave a weak signal but allowed sufficient detail for a rescue 
helicopter to be tasked. The helicopter located the divers' SMB, 
which could no longer be seen by the divers' boat, and hovered 
over the location. A lifeboat, also tasked by the Coastguard, 
recovered the divers and returned them safely to their RHIB 
which was then towed back to harbour. (Coastguard & RNLI 
reports).

A 5m RHIB was anchored on a wreck with the last pair of divers 
in the water when the engine wouldn't start. The Coastguard 
was contacted by VHF radio to make them aware of the 
situation. Whilst attempts to start the engine were made without 
success a lifeboat was scrambled. Worsening sea conditions 
prevented further attempts to start the engine. The divers 
surfaced and were recovered to the boat. The lifeboat towed the 
RHIB back to shore. 
July 2010 10/158 
The Coastguard received a call from a dive boat taking on 
water. The vessel had divers in the water which other vessels in 
the area were in the process of recovering. A lifeboat was 
launched and they assisted another vessel to take the boat 
under tow back to harbour. It was reported that some dive 
equipment had punctured the port side sponson of the RHIB.

orange flag. Rescue 131 was also tasked but the divers were 
recovered safely by their support boat and all units stood down.  
(Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
July 2010 10/179 
A group of divers entered the water in a tidal area for the final 
dive of a trip. The original site planned was not used due to 
marginal surface conditions. All divers were briefed to remain in 
shallow water around some wreckage and if they experienced 
any current that they should immediately deploy a delayed 
SMB. Five buddy pairs entered the water from a charter vessel 
which was accompanied by a RHIB. The brief was for a 
maximum dive time of 1 hour. One pair of divers experienced a 
moderate current after 30 min and deployed a delayed SMB. 
They continued for a further 10 min and then ascended and 
conducted a 6 min safety stop at 6m. On surfacing the divers 
were approximately 300m from the charter vessel but could not 
attract attention. The RHIB was not in sight. The divers 
deployed an extendable flag as well as a fully inflated delayed 
SMB and tried a whistle, an air horn and shouting but could not 
attract the attention of people in the wheelhouse. The divers 
drifted on the surface for 30 min across a channel and 
eventually climbed out onto some rocks. Meanwhile all the 
other divers had returned to the charter vessel and, realising 
the missing divers were overdue, the RHIB was dispatched to 
search down current for the missing divers. After around an 
hour of searching the divers were spotted on the rocks by the 
RHIB and recovered after they swam out to the RHIB. The 
divers had been spotted on the shore by walkers who had 
alerted the Coastguard by mobile phone. The Coastguard 
requested a lifeboat to launch to assist. The lifeboat met the 
boat as it was returning to harbour and escorted them back.

Ascent Incidents 
 
 
October 2009 10/019 
Two divers on a night dive to an inshore reef were joined by a 
third diver whose buddy had experienced an equipment failure 
before entering the water. During the descent down the shotline 
the third diver had disentangled the pair's SMB from the 
shotline. Towards the end of the dive to a maximum depth of 
15m the dive leader went to signal to terminate the dive, lost 
control of his buoyancy and ascended quickly to 5m 
accompanied by his original buddy. The third diver did not 
ascend at the same time and after regaining control the lead 
diver descended back to the seabed and signalled the third 
diver to ascend. On ascent the lead diver became tangled in his 
SMB line and lost sight of the third diver. The original buddy 
and the third diver both surfaced safely and returned to the 
boat. The dive leader conducted a mandatory safety stop 
indicated on his computer. Total dive time was 48 min. On the 
surface the dive leader and his original buddy were placed on 
oxygen. The dive leader reported a tingling in his right foot. On 
shore a neurological exam was conducted and advice sought 
from a Royal Navy diving doctor who advised a further 
neurological exam at A & E. Attendance at hospital showed no 
adverse effects but the diver was kept under observation 
overnight. 
October 2009 10/027 
At the start of the second dive of a day's training a student diver 
appeared uncomfortable but was not indicating any problem. 
The instructor positioned them to gain eye contact but the 
student seemed preoccupied. The instructor took a grip of the 
student to give reassurance and gain control whilst unaware 
that the student had put air into her BCD and the pair started to 
ascend rapidly. The instructor tried to slow the ascent but the 
student then removed her regulator. The instructor gave the 
student his alternate source which the student put in her mouth 
and then immediately removed it again and appeared to gulp 
water before bolting for the surface. On the surface the student 
removed her mask and the instructor gave the distress signal 
and started towing the student to the shore. Two other divers 
provided assistance before the site staff took over. Diving 
medical advice was sought and the student was placed on 
oxygen, taken into a warm environment and monitored. The 
student was advised to attend A&E which she did and was 
discharged with the advice to consult her GP if her condition 
deteriorated. 
November 2009 10/034 
A lifeboat was launched to assist a diver from a charter boat 
who had made a fast ascent from a wreck. The diver was 
transferred to the local recompression facility but no treatment 
was required. 
November 2009 10/032 
Two students and an instructor were on a training dive. 
Following a slow descent to 12m due to ear problems, one of 
the students got confused over direction and was seen to roll 
over onto her back. The second student assisted her back up. 
During this period the student pressed the purge valve on her 
alternate source by mistake and caused a slight free flow, she 
then inflated her BCD. The instructor grabbed hold of a fin as 
they rose some 3m off the bottom but could not hold on and lost 
his grip around 6m. The other student was still in sight and the 
instructor watched the first student to the surface and start 
swimming to shore. The instructor signalled the other student to 
ascend and they surfaced a short time later to see the first 
student being helped from the water by the dive manager. The 
first student's computer indicated caution due to a fast ascent 
but had not locked out. The student was given oxygen as a 
precaution and monitored but no ill effects were experienced. 
December 2009 10/049 
A diver suffered a fast ascent from 18m 16 min into a dive 
where a maximum depth of 25m had been reached. The diver 
was given oxygen but no other symptoms or treatment were 
reported. 
February 2010 10/085 
Four divers were conducting a training dive to a maximum 
depth of 13m. After approximately 20 min the divers rose up off 
the seabed to practise mid-water delayed SMB deployment. 
The instructor demonstrated followed by practice by the first two 
students. The third student was having difficulty maintaining his 
position and avoiding drifting into the others in the group and 
their SMB lines and, on a number of occasions, he descended 
and swam away from the group before returning. When the third 
student's turn came he prepared his delayed SMB and reel and 
partially inflated it but did not fully depress the ratchet release. 
He attempted to regain control by breathing out and 
repositioning his hand on the reel. His buddies attempted to 
grab his ankles but were unable to slow his ascent sufficiently. 
At around 4m the diver released the reel and attempted to 
dump air from both his drysuit and his BCD but could not 
prevent his ascent direct to the surface. His computer dive 
profile showed a fast ascent from 9m to the surface. The diver 
was recovered by boat and placed on 100% oxygen. He 
remained on oxygen until he had depleted a D-size cylinder. He 
was kept hydrated and monitored for the rest of the day without 
symptoms developing. 
February 2010 10/269 
Clyde Coastguard received a call from a dive boat reporting 
they had a diver onboard who thought he had missed a stop 
after he had lost buoyancy control and wanted medical advice.  
He was displaying no signs or symptoms of DCI.  Medical 
advice from the dive doctor at Aberdeen was to not dive again 
that day and monitor his condition.  (Coastguard report). 
February 2010 10/270 
Clyde Coastguard received a call requesting medical advice for 
a diver who had lost buoyancy and made a rapid ascent.  She 
was displaying no signs or symptoms of DCI and the boat had 
sufficient oxygen. The dive doctor at Aberdeen advised that she 
should be brought ashore and transferred to hospital to be 
monitored on oxygen for few hours.  (Coastguard report). 
April 2010 10/105 
A diver ran out of air at a depth of 23m after a 27 min dive. His 
buddy provided an alternate source but they made a fast ascent 
to the surface after panic set in. 
April 2010 10/227 
Two divers had completed a dive on a wreck at a maximum 
depth of 18m. One diver deployed a delayed SMB from 18m 
and whilst he was doing so the other diver attempted to clear 
his mask which had been leaking. The mask strap came away 
and the mask fell to the seabed. The other diver recovered it 
and held it to the diver's face for him to clear but the diver 

 
 
 ` NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2010 
30  ©BSAC - 2010 
panicked and made a rapid ascent to the surface. His buddy 
followed him to the surface. Both were picked up by boat and 
the diver who had lost his mask was put on oxygen as a 
precaution and monitored for 24 hours but he showed no signs 
or symptoms of DCI. 
April 2010 10/228 
A diver was on her first dive in a drysuit and first in the UK. 
Visibility was poor and at the end of a dive to a maximum depth 
of 12m when the instructor signalled to start ascending the diver 
inflated her suit.  She started finning up but lost control of her 
buoyancy. Total dive time was 15 min. The instructor lost sight 
of the diver and made a controlled ascent to the surface. The 
diver was recovered and oxygen administered as a precaution 
although no signs or symptoms of DCI were present. 
April 2010 10/106 
A diver suffered from bad suit squeeze that in turn caused the 
diver to panic and resulted in a fast ascent. 
April 2010 10/107 
A diver had conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 22m. 
Towards the end of the dive at a depth of 12m the diver had 
difficulty getting air out of her drysuit and made a fast ascent to 
the surface. The diver was given 100% oxygen. 
April 2010 10/108 
A diver had conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 28m and 
was at a depth of 22m when he experienced a regulator free 
flow. The diver made a fast ascent with a maximum dive time of 
10 min. 
April 2010 10/143 
A student was on his second open water training dive. On his 
previous dive he had not been comfortable with a standard 
weightbelt as it had kept slipping. He had borrowed a harness 
weightbelt which was checked as part of the buddy check. The 
student and instructor conducted all training exercises and then 
went on an exploratory dive. The student suddenly lost 
buoyancy and although the instructor grabbed him both made a 
rapid ascent to the surface from a depth of 8m. The dive was 
aborted at that point. Total dive time was 13 min. Once on 
shore it was discovered that a weight pouch had come out of 
the harness. The pouch could not be relocated. No ill effects 
were experienced by either diver. 
April 2010 10/274 
Clyde Coastguard received a second call in a day from a dive 
boat with another diver onboard who had made a rapid ascent.  
Again, the diver was not displaying any signs or symptoms of 
DCI and was placed on oxygen as a precaution.  Medical 
advice from a doctor at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary was that as 
she had no signs or symptoms she should be taken to A&E at 
Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  The dive boat was met by an 
ambulance on return and the diver was transferred to hospital 
for assessment and treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
April 2010 10/273 
Clyde Coastguard received a call from a dive boat reporting a 
diver onboard who had made a rapid ascent, but was not 
displaying any signs or symptoms of DCI and he was placed on

symptoms, he should be taken to A&E at Inverclyde Royal 
Hospital.  The dive boat was met by an ambulance on return 
and the diver was transferred to hospital for assessment.  
(Coastguard report).

After a break from diving a diver swam out on the surface with 
two buddies to a buoy marking a wreck. During the descent 
down the shotline the diver became disorientated. On reaching 
the bottom at a depth of 22m the diver felt uncomfortable and 
started to panic. The diver made a fast ascent to the surface 
and was recovered from the water into a rescue boat. 
April 2010 10/104 
An instructor and two students, accompanied by a sports diver, 
were practicing mask clearing on a 6m platform. The students 
had successfully cleared partially flooded masks with no 
problems. One student in attempting to clear a fully flooded 
mask inhaled water and panicked. The student made a rapid 
ascent to the surface. The instructor attempted to slow the 
ascent but his mask was displaced by the student. On the 
surface the student and instructor were made positively buoyant 
using their BCDs. The student was unharmed and calmed down 
after reaching the surface. The student and instructor 
descended again and completed training without further 
problems. 
April 2010 10/092 
Two students and an instructor were on a training dive to a 
maximum depth of 8m. After completing training exercises the 
group went on an exploratory dive. After a period of time one of 
the students showed the instructor her gauge which showed 40 
bar. The group swam to shallower water and the instructor then 
offered the student his alternate source. The student took in 
water when switching to the alternate source and the group 
ascended to the surface quickly. On the surface the student 
was coughing and slightly breathless but otherwise alright. The 
second student was asked to tow her back to shore. 
May 2010 10/112 
A pair of divers were at 22m 8 min into a dive when one of them 
had a regulator free flow. The diver panicked and made a fast 
ascent to the surface. Both divers recovered after relaxing on 
the surface for a short time. 
May 2010 10/285 
Brixham Coastguard received a call from a dive boat reporting 
they had a diver onboard who had suffered a rapid ascent, but 
was experiencing no signs or symptoms of DCI.  The boat was 
offered medical advice from a dive doctor which they declined 
as the diver was displaying no signs or symptoms.  The 
hyperbaric chamber were made aware of the situation.  The 
diver was placed on oxygen and his condition monitored.  The 
boat was informed to call back for assistance if anything 
changed.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2010 10/097 
A diver broke a fin strap whilst kitting up and was a little 
flustered before entering the water for his first dive of the year. 
He and his buddy entered the water and swam to the shotline. 
The diver had to duck dive and swim down the line, which was 
a usual practice due to air being slow to vent from his drysuit. 
During the dive he felt light and tried to find heavy objects to 
increase his weight but did not find any. At the end of a dive to 
a maximum depth of 23m the pair deployed their delayed SMB 
but had problems doing so. The buoyant diver began to ascend 
and was unable to return to the bottom. He suffered an 
uncontrolled and rapid ascent from a depth of 14m to the 
surface with a total dive time of 35 min. His dive computer 
recorded a rapid ascent and a missed safety stop but did not 
indicate an error. The diver was monitored and no symptoms of 
DCI appeared.

A pair of divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 39m. 
At the start of the ascent the first diver's dive computer 
indicated that a minimum of a 1 min stop at 3m was required. 
The lead diver signalled for a 1 minute stop at 9m to be 
conducted during the ascent and this stop was completed. The 
pair then ascended to 6m and the lead diver signalled for a 9 
minute stop at that level. After struggling to hold this stop for 
more than 1 min the first diver signalled for the lead diver to put 
up a delayed SMB. During deployment the pair descended to 
8m and then returned to 6m but the first diver was still 
struggling to hold the stop. Her computer was now showing 2 
min of required stops at 3m. The diver ascended to the surface 
at increasing speed despite attempting to dump air. The diver 
was picked up by boat and placed on 100% oxygen. Her dive 
computer indicated 5 min of missed stops at 3m. The diver was 
checked and monitored for the next 24 hours. No symptoms 
were evident. Cause ascribed to incorrect weighting using new 
drysuit. 
May 2010 10/100 
During a dive to a maximum depth of 20m a diver became 
buoyant and made an uncontrolled rapid ascent from 9m to the 
surface. Total dive time was 20 min. No ill effects reported. 
May 2010 10/144 
Two divers went on a wreck dive with a planned maximum dive 
time of 45 min. The divers conducted a dive to a maximum 
depth of 34m and started to deploy a delayed SMB around 29 
min as planned. During the ascent one diver had difficulty 
releasing air from both his drysuit and his BCD. He had 
previously only used his drysuit for buoyancy. The diver made a 
rapid ascent direct to the surface and missed all required 
decompression stops. On the surface he was seen to be 
surrounded by a tangle of his delayed SMB line. He reeled in 
the line and the cover boat approached. He then indicated that 
he had missed decompression stops and was going to descend 
to complete them. However, the dive manager insisted that he 
be recovered into the boat and the Coastguard was called. The 
diver was recovered and placed on 100% oxygen and checked 
for signs and symptoms of DCI with none apparent. The 
Coastguard contacted a diving doctor for advice who advised 
that, as long as the diver remained symptom-free, they could 
wait for his buddy to surface. The buddy surfaced after 
completing approximately 15 min mandatory decompression 
stops at 6m but omitting any safety stops. The boat then 
returned to shore and the diver was transferred to A&E by 
ambulance. The diver received several tests and remained on 
oxygen for more than 6 hours without symptoms appearing and 
was subsequently discharged. 
May 2010 10/293 
Shetland Coastguard received a call from a dive boat reporting 
they had two divers onboard who had made a rapid ascent from 
a shallow depth, but were not displaying any signs or symptoms 
of DCI.  They were placed on 100% oxygen as a precaution. 
Kirkwall ALB proceeded to intercept the boat and, on arrival, 
found there were actually three divers.  The lifeboat escorted 
the boat back to shore where they were met by Kirkwall CRT 
and ambulances to be transferred to the hyperbaric chamber for 
assessment.  None of them needed treatment in the chamber.  
(Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
May 2010 10/114 
Solent Coastguard received a call from a dive boat reporting a 
diver who had made a rapid ascent from 30m and missed 
decompression stops.  Medical advice from a dive doctor was 
that as the diver was not showing any signs or symptoms of 
DCI, he should be evacuated as soon as possible to St 
Richards hospital for assessment.  Rescue helicopter R104 was 
tasked to evacuate the diver and transfer. Selsey CRT assisted 
at the HLS and Lymington CRT met the dive boat on return. 
(Coastguard report). 
May 2010 10/294 
Humber Coastguard received a call from a dive boat reporting a 
diver onboard who had made a rapid ascent.  Rescue helicopter 
R-131 was tasked to evacuate the diver and their buddy, and 
the ILB from Seahouses was sent to the scene to assist with 
the transfer.  The helicopter was met at the HLS by Hull CRT 
and the diver and buddy were transferred to Hull hyperbaric 
chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
May 2010 10/301 
Dive boat reported a diver had made a rapid ascent and may 
need medical assistance. Connected through to duty doctor at 
DDRC who said diver should be alright on oxygen unless 
symptoms occurred later. No further action required.  
(Coastguard report). 
June 2010 10/120 
A diver and his buddy conducted a wreck dive to 29m for a total 
duration of 41 min. At the end of the dive the diver made a rapid 
ascent from 25m to the surface despite doing everything he 
could to try and control it. Onboard the charter boat the 
Coastguard was called who then tasked a Coastguard 
helicopter and the diver and his buddy were airlifted to a 
recompression facility. This was the first dive since the diver 
had changed to a 15 litre cylinder and although he had adjusted 
his weights it may not have been sufficient. 
June 2010 10/124 
Three divers conducted a dive on an underwater pinnacle and 
reached a maximum depth of 23m. Towards the end of the dive 
the trio ascended onto a plateau at the top of the pinnacle and 
set off in the direction of the shotline. Unnoticed by the other 
two, one of the divers started to feel herself rising up. She tried 
to dump air from her drysuit auto dump and also tried pressing 
the valve to manually dump air but was still ascending. The 
diver started to slow down as she approached 6m and thought 
she had managed to stop at 5m but was still gently rising and 
could not complete a safety stop and surfaced. Total ascent 
time was 1 min. The diver was recovered to the boat and made 
to lie down and given 100% oxygen. The other two divers 
noticed she was missing and returned to where they had last 
seen her, checked the drop off for signs of bubbles and then 
deployed a delayed SMB and ascended to the surface. On 
surfacing they were relieved to see the other diver already in 
the RHIB. The Coastguard was contacted requesting a link call 
with a diving doctor. The doctor advised that the diver should 
remain on oxygen and be monitored for symptoms. After 1 hour 
on 100% oxygen, without any signs or symptoms of DCI, the 
doctor advised that it was all right for her to return home without 
further assessment or recompression treatment. No adverse 
effects were experienced. 
June 2010 10/313 
Shetland Coastguard was informed of a diving casualty, 53 
male, rapid ascent from 30-35m no signs of DCI, casualty was 
walking up jetty to ambulance. Stromness Coastguard assisted, 
problems with reception with radio at Houghton, tried in several 
places including at top of the hill but couldn’t get through. 
Casualty taken to Houghton, placed on oxygen.  (Coastguard 
report).

Shetland Coastguard was alerted to a diver having made a 
rapid ascent from 8m, the vessel was met by an ambulance and 
the casualty taken to Balfor hospital as a precaution.  
(Coastguard report). 
June 2010 10/129 
A pair of divers planned to dive to a maximum depth of 35m. 
Approximately 7 min into the dive at a depth of 29m one of the 
divers experienced a free flow. He could not read his computer 
or cylinder pressure gauge due to the bubbles. He took his 
buddy's octopus and threw his regulator over his right shoulder 
so that he could read his gauges. His buddy turned off his 
cylinder to prevent further gas loss. The diver signalled to 
ascend but without an air supply for buoyancy the first attempt 
to start the ascent failed. On the second attempt the diver 
finned as well as using his buddy's buoyancy and the divers 
ascended from 25m to the surface without a safety stop. On the 
surface the diver inflated his BCD orally and from his BCD 
emergency cylinder and the pair swam to the shore and exited 
the water. Total dive time was 13 min. The diver was monitored 
for signs and symptoms of DCI for 1 hour but no ill effects were 
noted. 
June 2010 10/245 
A diver experienced a free flow at a depth of 18m. His buddy 
provided an alternate source and they ascended to 12m where 
their gas pressure was down to 30 bar and the divers made a 
fast direct ascent to the surface. Oxygen was administered as a 
precaution for 10 min. No signs or symptoms of DCI seen. 
June 2010 10/132 
A diver forgot to fit his weightbelt. After completing a dive to a 
maximum depth of 31m the diver reported being very light at 
15m and then could not hold his stops at 10m. The diver 
surfaced missing 10 min of stops. Total dive time was 60 min. 
The diver did not display any symptoms of DCI but after 
receiving advice from a diving doctor via the Coastguard the 
charter boat returned to shore and the diver was taken by 
ambulance to a recompression chamber for further 
examination. (Coastguard report). 
June 2010 10/135 
Three divers planned a dive to 30m involving a maximum of 10 
min of stops. The divers started their ascent up the shotline 
after 25 min with 6 min of stops showing. At 15m one of the 
divers wanted to practise mid-water delayed SMB deployment 
which was completed without incident. One of the other divers 
then let go of the shotline to join the other two, lost buoyancy 
control and went directly to the surface omitting 2 min of 
required decompression stops. He was recovered into the boat 
and placed on 100% oxygen for approximately 20 min. No signs 
or symptoms of DCI occurred. The diver did not dive again that 
day or the next day. The other two divers completed their stops 
and ascended normally. On surfacing the diver had found his 
BCD to be half full when he had expected it to have been 
empty. On examination the diver's BCD was found to have a 
slow leak from the inflator valve. 
June 2010 10/209 
Two divers were ascending under a delayed SMB from a dive to 
a maximum depth of 28m for a total of 33 min. As they reached 
a depth of 10m a diving charter boat reversed over their 
delayed SMB whilst trying to avoid a fixed shotline causing 
them to have a brief fast ascent to 4m before descending again. 
The line became tangled with the boat and although the skipper 
was alerted he did nothing to untangle it and some of his 
passengers eventually released the line. The divers completed 
safety stops at 3m with no further problems. 
June 2010 10/326 
Clyde Coastguard was contacted by a dive support vessel 
reporting having a diver aboard having made a rapid ascent 
from 15m following a dive to 27m. A medical connect call was 
established between the Coastguard the vessel and the 
hyperbaric chamber at Millport, the doctor advised the diver 
should be brought to the chamber to be checked over, the diver 
had previously had a PFO resolved. The casualty was 
transferred to Largs lifeboat and taken to shore for onward 
transportation to the chamber, the diver was kept under 
observation for 24 hours.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
July 2010 10/159 
A diver and his buddy conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 
27m for a total of 46 min. During the ascent from the bottom the 
divers' delayed SMB line became snagged at 20m which took 
time to rectify. The pair then ascended to a 6m safety stop for 2 
min. During the final 4m the diver lost control of his buoyancy 
and ascended faster than normal. On the surface both divers 
responded with 'OK' signals but on coming alongside the boat 
one of the divers' computers was sounding an alarm. Once 
onboard, in response to questioning about the alarm, the diver 
reported missing 14 min of decompression stops. The diver was 
placed on 100% oxygen but there were no symptoms of DCI. 
On reaching shore the diver reported some numbness in his 
right hand but explained this was normal for him after gripping 
an object like the oxygen mask for an extended period. The 
diver was taken to a recompression facility and received a 
precautionary 2 hour 20 min recompression treatment. 
July 2010 10/157 
Yarmouth Coastguard received a call from a dive vessel 
reporting that they had a diver aboard who had missed several 
minutes of decompression stops. Yarmouth Coastguard tasked 
Happisburg lifeboat and rescue helicopter R-125 to recover the 
diver and transfer him to James Padget hospital, the patient 
was later discharged requiring no treatment.  (Coastguard & 
RNLI reports). 
July 2010 10/334 
Solent Coastguard was informed by Dover Coastguard of a 
diver in Solent SRR having made a rapid ascent whilst on a 
dive. No further SAR action taken, casualty kept under 
observation.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2010 10/332 
Forth Coastguard received a call from a skipper of a dive RHIB 
reporting that he had a diver that had missed decompression 
stops after a 45m dive. There was a one other diver in the 
water. The RHIB was 3/4 of a mile NE of the Bass Rock. 
Dunbar lifeboat was tasked and a request was made for a 
helicopter. A call was made to the dive doctor in Aberdeen. It 
was established the diver had suffered a panic attack and was 
showing no signs of a DCI, North Berwick and Dunbar lifeboats 
also attended. All units stood down, operations terminated.  
(Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
July 2010 10/229 
Two divers were on a reef dive as part of a week long diving 
trip. One of the divers was fairly new to drysuit diving. After a 
dive to a maximum depth of 30m the divers were at a depth of 
23m and just going into decompression stops when they found 
themselves swimming against a current. The diver lost control 
of his buoyancy which led to a fast ascent from around 20m. 
The diver's computer locked out. His buddy made a controlled

?BSAC - 2010   33 
ascent to the surface. Total dive time was 30 min. The diver 
experienced no symptoms of DCI but was given oxygen as a 
precaution and he did not dive for 48 hours. 
July 2010 10/247 
Following a dive to 37m a diver experienced a first stage 
regulator failure at 28m whilst completing a deep stop. The 
diver ascended to the surface without completing any further 
stops. The diver showed no signs of DCI but was given oxygen 
and advised to attend A&E for assessment. 
July 2010 10/173 
A diver conducted two dives in a day with a 1 hour surface 
interval between dives. Dive 1 20m for 30 min including a 3 min 
safety stop at 3m. Dive 2 20m for a total time of 17 min. At the 
end of this second dive the diver lost control of his buoyancy at 
a depth of 20m and had an uncontrolled ascent to the surface 
missing a 3 min safety stop at 6m. The diver swam to the shore 
on the surface and was given oxygen for 30 min. A 
recompression chamber was contacted for advice and they 
advised that there should be no problem but if any symptoms of 
DCI were to occur the diver should go straight to them for 
treatment. No ill effects were experienced. 
July 2010 10/338 
Clyde Coastguard was contacted by a dive support vessel 
requesting medical advice for two divers who had made a rapid 
ascent following a dive to 25m, the advice was to evacuated the 
divers, both taken to Dunstaffnage initially and one on to Lorne 
& Isle Hospital Oban.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2010 10/175 
Shortly after arriving at 17m at the start of a dive one diver 
experienced a painful cramp in her leg. The pain caused her to 
panic and start to ascend. Her buddy took hold of her BCD and 
tried to control the ascent. Efforts to control the ascent had no 
effect and the speed of ascent increased rapidly. The buddy let 
go at 5m and controlled his own buoyancy making a normal 
ascent to the surface. The buoyant diver surfaced very fast but 
was conscious and talking to those in the cover boat. Total dive 
time was 9 min. Both divers were recovered into the boat. The 
diver who had made the rapid ascent was sat down and 
assessed. She vomited once and requested to be taken back to 
shore but this was refused. Both divers were placed on oxygen, 
given fluids and closely monitored. Medical advice was sought 
and they were advised that no further treatment was necessary. 
The pair were monitored for a further hour and advised to seek 
help immediately if symptoms appeared. No ill effects were 
reported by either diver. 
July 2010 10/239 
A diver on a previous dive had been heavy and so removed 2kg 
of weight. She conducted a wreck dive with two other divers to 
a maximum depth of 38m and a bottom time of 15 min and had 
an indicated 15 min of decompression stops. The shotline had 
come loose from the wreck and so the divers ascended on a 
delayed SMB but the diver was unable to stop at 6m and 
ascended direct to the surface missing decompression stops. 
Her buddies completed their decompression stops and surfaced 
normally. The diver was recovered to the RHIB and although 
feeling normal was placed on 100% oxygen and the Coastguard 
contacted for advice. Sea conditions were deteriorating and it 
was expected to take over an hour to return to shore and so a 
helicopter was scrambled even though the diver was not 
displaying symptoms. The diver was airlifted to a recompression 
chamber and received two precautionary recompression 
treatments but no symptoms of DCI occurred. 
July 2010 10/347 
Solent Coastguard was alerted by a dive support vessel 
reporting that they had a diver aboard having made a rapid 
ascent from 23m whilst deploying a delayed SMB the line did 
not reel out causing the diver to be dragged to the surface. As a 
precaution the diver was airlifted by Coastguard rescue 
helicopter R-104 to Poole HLS for onward transportation to the 
chamber, the helicopter was met at the HLS by Poole CRT.  
(Coastguard report). 
July 2010 10/183 
A pair of divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 22m 
for 35 min. The pair became separated and one diver deployed 
a delayed SMB but became tangled up with the reel. She failed 
to free it and was dragged to the surface in a rapid ascent and 
missed decompression stops. A call to the Coastguard was 
made and the diver airlifted to a recompression chamber. No 
symptoms were reported. (Coastguard report). 
July 2010 10/351 
Shetland Coastguard received a call informing them of a diver 
who had missed stops following a 35m dive for 43 min having 
made a stop at 20m but missed all later ones the diver was 
being administered 100% oxygen. The diver was met by an 
ambulance at Houton for transportation to Stromness chamber.  
(Coastguard report). 
August 2010 10/357 
Brixham Coastguard was contacted by a dive support vessel 
reporting they had a diver aboard who had made a rapid ascent 
from 64m, a medical link call established the diver required 
immediate evacuation, RN rescue helicopter R-193 airlifted the 
casualty direct from the craft and flew to DDRC Plymouth. The 
diver was semiconscious and had breathing difficulties, 
Plymouth CRT met the vessel on return to port.  (Coastguard 
report). 
August 2010 10/358 
Holyhead Coastguard received a call from a dive support vessel 
reporting they had two divers aboard who had made a rapid 
ascent from 20m. A medi link call was established by Holyhead 
Coastguard with a diving specialist, rescue helicopter R-122 
recovered the divers to a chamber for treatment, Hoylake 
Coastguard team prepared the HLS.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2010 10/230 
Five divers were diving a wreck as a trio and a buddy pair. The 
trio descended the shotline with one leading due to difficulty 
clearing her ears. The shotline had strands protruding from it 
where boats had moored and the other pair in the trio had 
problems with entanglement in the line. The divers reached the 
wreck at a depth of 35m and began a circumnavigation of it. As 
they reached the bridge all three had approximately 120 bar 
remaining. One of the divers became distracted by the other 
pair of divers and then became concerned about his air 
reserves. The diver then became confused and signalled to 
head down and forwards believing this to be the direction to the 
shotline but the group ended up on the seabed at a depth of 
40m. The divers tried to head back towards the wreck but could 
not locate it. The diver was now down to 50 bar and so he 
signalled for one of the others to deploy a delayed SMB as both 
had 90 bar remaining. A delayed SMB was deployed but the 
line seemed to take a long time to deploy and the diver began 
ascending before it had fully deployed. One of the others also 
started to ascend and she signalled the third diver with the reel 
to do the same before the line had finished deploying. The first 
two divers ascended to 6m to conduct a decompression stop. 
The third diver was unable to stop and ascended directly to the

surface with the delayed SMB reel. The other two divers 
continued their stop but the first diver was unable to locate his 
pony cylinder regulator. Both divers ran out of air after 
completing 14 min of 17 min required decompression stops. As 
the divers surfaced they saw the boat about to pick up the third 
diver and shouted for her to be put on oxygen. After recovery all 
three divers received oxygen and drank several litres of water. 
The Coastguard was called and, although no symptoms were 
being displayed, medical advice was sought and the divers 
were taken by helicopter to a recompression chamber. They 
were assessed, put on oxygen and monitored for 12 hours and 
released without further treatment. 
August 2010 10/214 
A pair of divers completed the second dive of the day to a 
maximum depth of 29m. The divers deployed a delayed SMB 
from the top of the boilers on a wreck. On deployment, the 
delayed SMB started to stream indicating that the tide had 
turned. As the divers started their ascent the diver with the reel 
grabbed his buddy's BCD and would not let go or wind in the 
reel. The second diver took the reel from him and found it 
difficult to use. The divers continued to rise and at 15m the 
second diver's computer started to sound a rapid ascent alarm. 
The divers continued to the surface unable to control the 
ascent. The second diver's computer indicated they had missed 
9 min of stops. The divers were recovered into their RHIB and 
monitored whilst taking plenty of fluids. Oxygen was prepared 
but not used and no symptoms appeared. Subsequent 
investigation established that the delayed SMB had been drawn 
across the shotline and that a metal snap link at the base of the 
buoy had clipped onto the shotline. Dive profiles showed that 
the ascent was steady and at just over 10m/min. 
August 2010 10/202 
A diver had conducted two dives the previous day without 
incident. The diver and his buddy had an uneventful dive on the 
second day on a wreck to a maximum depth of 32m. The pair 
began a normal ascent but at 7m the diver lost buoyancy 
control and ascended to the surface with his computer 
indicating 7 min of missed decompression stops. He tried to 
descend but then surfaced again and his computer locked out. 
His buddy joined him a short time later having completed a safe 
ascent. On recovery to the boat another DCI incident (Incident 
10/201) was being dealt with. The diver was asked how he was 
and confirmed he was alright but had a very slight pain in the 
chest area which he put down to strain whilst boarding the 
charter boat. He was placed on nitrox and laid down but 
showed no other symptoms. He was taken by the same 
helicopter as the other casualty (Incident 10/201) to a 
recompression chamber. He received a 4 hour treatment. 
August 2010 10/371 
Milford Haven Coastguard was called by a dive support vessel, 
reporting they had a diver aboard who had made a rapid ascent 
from 4m, a medical connect call was established, the duty 
doctor recommended the casualty be given plenty to drink and 
be administered oxygen and kept under observation.  
(Coastguard report). 
August 2010 10/249 
A diver experienced a faster than normal ascent from 22m and 
was put on oxygen for 20 min. No ill effects. 
August 2010 10/377 
A dive support vessel contacted Humber Coastguard 
requesting medical advice for a diver who had missed stops 
following a dive to 38m, the vessel was advised to return to 
port, where a waiting ambulance would take the diver to Hull 
hyperbaric chamber for treatment, Bridlington CRT met the 
vessel when it returned to port.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2010 10/237 
At the end of a dive to a wreck at 40m a waster line was 
attached to the wreck, the main tie in line was removed and a 
lifting bag was attached to the anchor and inflated. The waster 
line snapped and a diver holding on to the shotline was dragged 
up to the surface by the lifting bag, missing decompression 
stops. The diver's buddy deployed a delayed SMB and made a 
normal ascent. The diver was recovered onto the boat and 
placed on 100% oxygen for 90 min. The Coastguard was 
contacted and a helicopter airlifted the diver to hospital where 
the diver was assessed. No symptoms of DCI occurred. The 
diver received a two and a half hour recompression treatment 
as a precaution and was released and advised not to dive for

A dive vessel contacted Shetland Coastguard reporting they 
had a diver aboard who had made a rapid ascent following a 
dive to 41m, missing stops. An ambulance was requested to 
transport the casualty to a recompression chamber for 
treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2010 10/222 
A pair of divers were diving on an offshore reef. The divers 
slowly descended down the reef to a maximum depth of 29m. 
The divers then worked their way back up the reef to 
approximately 25m. One of the divers then experienced cramp 
and was clearly in difficulties but did not indicate to his buddy 
what the problem was. The diver held on to the reef for a few 
minutes and then signalled that he wanted to ascend. The other 
diver deployed a delayed SMB approximately 15 min into the 
dive. The diver started to follow the line up but was signalled to 
slow down as he was a little too fast but, at a depth of 18m, he 
lost control and started to ascend faster. In doing so he held on 
to the delayed SMB line and pulled the other diver up as well. 
The diver ascended directly to the surface. The second diver 
managed to control his ascent before reaching 6m and 
completed a 5 min safety stop and surfaced after 22 min total 
dive time, whilst the buoyant diver observed him from the 
surface. Both divers were then recovered into their boat and the 
first diver was given oxygen and sips of water for 15 min and 
was monitored. No signs or symptoms of DCI were 
experienced. 
September 2010 10/399 
Shetland Coastguard received details of a diving emergency 
from a dive support vessel, reporting having a diver who had 
made a rapid ascent from 20m, 27m dive time 25 min, missed 
no stops, rapid ascent, has been on oxygen since on surface, 
the vessel was met by Stromness CRT and an ambulance, the 
casualty was taken to Stromness for treatment.  (Coastguard 
report).

Technique Incidents 
 
 
November 2009  10/037 
A diver was on a training dive practicing regulator removal and 
replacement in cold water and poor visibility. The diver did not 
replace the regulator properly and so received a mouthful of 
water when she tried to breathe in. The diver tried to remain 
calm and clear the regulator but kept choking on water. The 
instructor took control and recovered the diver safely to the 
surface. No serious effects were experienced. 
April 2010 10/080 
A diver conducted a solo dive to a maximum depth of 6m and a 
duration of 56 min. He had briefed two non-diving friends 
ashore of his plans. On surfacing he was further east than he 
had intended and had a long surface swim back to shore. On 
returning to the location where he expected to find his friends 
they were not there. The friends had not seen the delayed SMB 
surface because it had not been deployed where expected and 
there were several boats moored in the bay. Believing the diver 
to be overdue the friends had moved along the road to try and 
get a mobile phone signal and called a mutual friend in 
Scotland who was a diver. The mutual friend alerted the 
Coastguard in Scotland who raised the alarm with the local 
Coastguard. Local Coastguard tasked local team to investigate 
and found all well. 
May 2010 10/283 
Brixham Coastguard received a call from a person on the shore 
reporting they had seen a diver surface, blow a whistle, raise 
his arms and descend again.  Berry Head CRT and both Torbay 
lifeboats were sent to the scene to investigate.  There was a 
boat in the area that it was ascertained was fishing, and 
someone waiting on the beach for a diver to return, but it was 
not the diver who had blown the whistle.  There was a group of 
divers observed returning to shore and it was found to be one of 
these who surfaced and blew the whistle.  He had agreed with 
his group on the shore prior to the dive that he would go out and 
check the tides and indicate by surfacing, blowing the whistle 
and making an 'OK' signal.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
July 2010 10/340 
Yarmouth Coastguard conducted an extensive communications 
search for a dive boat, which was 2 hours overdue from their 
reported return from a dive. Sheringham Coastguard searched 
the launch sites at Sheringham and spoke to crews of fishing 
boats. Local dive clubs contacted. Someone from the dive boat 
eventually called up reporting they were ashore and apologising 
for forgetting to notify the Coastguard they were ashore.  
(Coastguard report). 
August 2010 10/356 
Yarmouth Coastguard.  Three divers went into the water without 
an SMB, advised by lifeguard that it is unsafe in this area. 
Divers were 100 yds offshore. Hopefully this will not turn into an 
incident but the behaviour of these people is reckless in the 
extreme and it is worth recording that they have been advised 
of their foolishness and have chosen to ignore the advice. 
Should anything to happen to them we will at least know the 
background. The lifeguards are going to keep a watch but there 
is no further action I can undertake at this time.  (Coastguard 
report). 
August 2010 10/196 
A group of four divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 
10m. One of the divers was wearing a twin-set with an isolation 
manifold. Towards the end of the dive the diver began to 
experience difficulty breathing from his regulator. In checking 
his contents gauges he realised that one cylinder was empty 
and the other was completely full and that he had conducted the 
dive with the manifold closed. Because of the multiple options 
of regulators available the diver took the octopus of one of the 
other divers before opening the isolation valve and then 
switching back to his main regulator. No ill effects were 
experienced. 
August 2010 10/365 
Portland Coastguard was alerted by an RYA support vessel of 
an unattended RHIB flying a diving flag 100m off the Nothe 
Fort, Weymouth. While Weymouth RNLI beach lifeguards 
proceeded to investigate a snorkeler returned to the RHIB.  
(Coastguard report). 
August 2010 10/199 
Two pairs of divers were to dive from a boat. After the first pair 
of divers had entered the water the second pair began kitting 
up. One of the divers discovered that his side slung 
decompression cylinder containing nitrox 80 was missing and a 
similar cylinder containing air remained in the boat. This meant 
that one of the first pair of divers had unknowingly taken the 
decompression mix on a dive to 33m.  The dive manager 
deployed a thunderflash to recall the divers. The first pair 
surfaced having reached a maximum depth of 25m. The divers 
were recovered to the boat and the incorrect cylinder identified. 
The diver confirmed that he had not breathed from it.

Equipment Incidents 
 
 
January 2010  10/058 
A diver experienced a regulator free flow at 20m 10 min into a 
dive. 
February 2010 10/059 
A diver experienced a free flow at 21m 23 min into a dive. On 
switching to his buddy's alternate source he could not get a 
breath initially due to a flow stop device being in the 'Off' 
position. 
February 2010 10/055 
After nearly 29 min on a dive to a maximum depth of 20m a 
diver found that, when he tried to inhale, no air was available. 
The diver quickly realised that the mouthpiece had separated 
from the body of the regulator second stage, leaving the diver 
with just the mouthpiece in his mouth. The diver did not breathe 
in any water. He swapped to his own alternate source and 
surfaced safely. 
April 2010 10/090 
Two divers conducted a dive on a wreck at an inland site to a 
maximum depth of 22m. Some time into the dive the pair found 
a shot weightbelt approximately 20m from the wreck and one 
diver sent this up to the surface using his delayed SMB for later 
collection. The second diver then deployed his delayed SMB. 
During this deployment, at a depth of 14m, the second diver's 
octopus started to free flow. Efforts to stop this free flow by both 
divers failed and so the first diver donated a gas source and 
switched to his own backup. During the ascent to the surface 
the free flowing regulator emptied the cylinder. On the surface 
the divers recovered the delayed SMB and weightbelt and 
returned to shore. 
May 2010 10/099 
An instructor and student conducted a closed circuit rebreather 
training dive to a maximum depth of 15m. The student was 
conducting a drill to correct a high oxygen partial pressure 
situation. The student bailed out to open circuit and conducted 
all required actions including isolation of the oxygen cylinder. 
On reopening the oxygen cylinder the PO2 was seen to rise 
significantly to a level in excess of 2 bar. The student remained 
off the loop and repeated the drill with the PO2 again rising to 
high levels. The student then surfaced on open circuit with the 
instructor. On the surface the pair were able to return to normal 
operation and conduct the remainder of training on a 6m 
platform. This was the same pair of divers and problem as 
encountered in incident 10/126. 
May 2010 10/126 
An instructor and student conducted a CCR training dive to a 
maximum depth of 20m. The student was conducting a drill to 
correct a high oxygen partial pressure. The student bailed out to 
open circuit and conducted all required actions including 
isolation of the oxygen cylinder. On reopening the oxygen 
cylinder the PO2 was seen to rise significantly  to a level in 
excess of 2 bar. The student remained off the loop and 
repeated the drill with the PO2 again rising to high levels. The 
student then surfaced on open circuit with the instructor. On the 
surface the pair were able to return to normal operation and 
conduct the remainder of training at 15m monitoring the PO2 
readings with no further problems. This was the same pair of 
divers and problem as encountered in incident 10/099. 
May 2010 10/098 
An instructor and two students were practicing alternate source 
drills on a dive to a maximum depth of 14m. Visibility was poor 
and made worse by disturbed silt from the bottom. After a 
couple of partial ascents the students swapped roles and as 
one donated her alternate source to the other the second 
student's primary regulator started to free flow. The instructor 
attempted to stop the free flow but could not stop it. He then 
went to turn off the cylinder but this did not stop the flow either 
and the instructor realised that he had turned off the first 
student's cylinder by mistake. He turned this cylinder back on 
and neither student noticed. He then isolated the second 
student's cylinder and this stopped the flow of gas. He switched 
the cylinder back on again and the regulator was working but 
there was only 10 bar of gas remaining. The instructor then 
donated his alternate gas source to the second student and all 
three ascended to the surface where the student who was out 
of gas returned to the boat and the instructor and the other 
student descended and completed training. No ill effects were 
experienced. 
May 2010 10/242 
A diver experienced a free flow during a dive to 26m for a total 
of 18 min and made a normal ascent but omitted a safety stop 
on the way up. The divers used their own oxygen as a 
precaution. 
May 2010 10/243 
A diver experienced a free flow at 34m and ascended. Total 
dive time was 19 min. He was placed on oxygen for 5 min as a 
precaution. 
June 2010 10/131 
An instructor was conducting a dive-leading demonstration dive 
for two student divers on a wreck. During the dive the instructor 
saw a weight pouch fall from one of the other divers' BCDs. The 
pouch landed on the deck of the wreck; it was recovered and 
replaced securely. The pouch was only around 2kg and so it 
was considered unlikely to have caused the mechanism to 
release; hence it was assumed that the pouch had not been 
fully secured at the start of the dive. The dive was completed 
without further incident. 
August 2010 10/208 
A recently qualified diver entered the water with an instructor for 
her first dive in the UK at an inland site. At a depth of 4m the 
BCD inflator hose became detached. The pair ascended and 
the diver was made buoyant and both returned to shore. The 
diver was treated for shock. Inspection of the equipment found 
a fault with the inflator hose and it was replaced. The dive 
centre suggested the use of the on site swimming pool to 
undertake an equipment and buoyancy check, which was 
undertaken. 3 hours later the pair completed a dive to 10m for 
25 min without further problems. 
September 2010 10/221 
Two divers undertook a wreck dive using closed circuit 
rebreathers and using DPVs. The divers descended the 
shotline and found poor underwater conditions not suited to 
DPV use but because one diver was trying his with a view to 
buying one he continued with the dive. Approximately 17 min 
into the dive the diver realised that in his excitement to try the 
DPV he had not switched his rebreather to the high set point, 

 
 
NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2010    
?BSAC - 2010   37 
which he then did. 1 min later the diver found the PO2 reading 
to be 2.5 bar, the maximum the cells could report. All cells 
reported this consistently and the unit alarms and head-up 
display were signalling the high level. The diver conducted a 
diluent flush but the levels did not change. The diver went to the 
seabed at 47m and again conducted a diluent flush, again 
without a change of reading.  The diver turned off his oxygen 
supply and continued to flush and achieved a reduction on 
PO2. On turning the oxygen cylinder back on the levels rose 
again to unacceptable levels. The diver then bailed out using 
the integrated bailout valve and settled himself. It took some 
time to prepare to switch to his off-board bailout gas as the 
diver used a gag strap but, having switched, the pair of divers 
made their way to the top of the wreck and the buddy deployed 
a delayed SMB, whilst the diver switched his computer to open 
circuit. The divers began their ascent and the diver switched to 
his off-board decompression gas of nitrox 50 at a depth of 21m. 
The divers conducted decompression stops starting at a depth 
of 24m. Whilst at the 6m stop the diver checked his closed 
circuit rebreather handsets and found they were reading 0.7 
bar. He switched on the oxygen cylinder and found the unit 
maintained a stable reading and so he went back on the loop to 
utilise the higher PO2 for the remaining decompression stops. 
The divers moved up to a 3m stop and after 1 min at this stop 
the unit again started adding excess oxygen which resulted in 
the diver being unable to maintain depth and he slowly rose to 
the surface missing 11 min of decompression stops at 3m. His 
buddy followed him up and missed 18 min of indicated stops. 
Both divers were recovered from the water and breathed high 
PO2 from their rebreathers and took a large amount of fluids. 
No symptoms of DCI were noticed. Investigation of the 
equipment revealed a corroded solenoid. The diver attributes 
this to leaving the unit packed away for three months following 
an overseas trip. 
September 2010 10/231 
Two divers were conducting their third dive of the day after a 4 
hour surface interval. Previous dives were 24m for 36 min and 
24m for 34 min. Towards the end of a dive to a maximum depth 
of 11m in thick kelp the divers agreed to start their ascent. As 
one diver started his ascent his computer indicated he was 
going up too fast and so he pulled his dump valve and the valve 
came away from the jacket, although the diver was not aware of 
the cause at the time. His buddy had looked away briefly at this 
time and only witnessed a mass of bubble above him. The 
buddy surfaced to find the diver unable to stay on the surface. 
The diver signalled for his buddy's octopus believing that he 
had no air. In his panic the diver grabbed his buddy knocking 
his regulator out and pushing him under the water. The buddy 
replaced his regulator, pushed the diver away and took hold of 
him from the side. He was unable to support both of them on his 
own BCD and so released his own weightbelt, instructed the 
diver to do the same and then signalled to the shore for help. 
The divers were now outside the kelp line and were drifting in 
the current and so the buddy towed the diver towards a buoy 
and they awaited for a boat from shore to recover them.

Brixham Coastguard received a call from a person on the shore 
reporting they could see two divers they thought could be in 
difficulty as they seemed to be drifting further out to sea.  Berry 
Head CRT were tasked to proceed to the scene to investigate.  
On route to the scene they spoke to the informant who advised 
that the divers had surfaced and as the CRT arrived the divers 
were just exiting the water unaided.  The CRT spoke to the 
divers who confirmed that they were alright and had not been in 
any trouble.  FAWGI.  (Coastguard report). 
February 2010 10/267

Fatalities 
 
June 2010  10/128 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 29m.  During 
the dive he lost consciousness and was recovered to the 
surface by a controlled buoyant lift.  The diver failed to survive.  
The cause of death was determined to be drowning.  The diver 
had previously had heart surgery but had been passed fit to 
dive. 
 
 
Decompression Illness 
 
October 2009  10/210 
The day after two days diving a diver experienced symptoms of 
DCI and received recompression treatment. The first day had 
included two very shallow dives to less than 5m and a full day 
teaching on the beach. On the second day two dives to 14m 
and 12m were completed for 57 min and 30 min respectively. 
On the evening of the second day the diver reported some 
discomfort but went to bed assuming it was a strain or similar. 
He awoke the next morning with severe pain in both elbows and 
initially put this down to a joint problem and not DCI. However 
the pain increased and so the diver contacted a diving 
colleague who assessed the diver at his home, applied oxygen 
and arranged for transport to a recompression chamber where 
he received two treatments. 
September 2010 10/220 
A diver had conducted a dive to 51m using trimix 21/35 for a 
bottom time of 35 min. He used nitrox 50 for decompression on 
the ascent. On arrival at a 9m decompression stop the diver 
experienced pain in his right elbow. The pain eased at the 6m 
stop but became more severe at the 3m stop and excruciating 
on surfacing. Total dive time including stops was 90 min. The 
dive boat made an emergency call to the Coastguard and 
although in the French sector of the channel UK Coastguard 
assumed control. A helicopter was tasked and airlifted the diver 
to a recompression chamber for treatment. (Coastguard report). 
September 2010 10/240 
On the fifth day of a diving holiday a diver conducted the first 
dive of the day on a wreck to 35m for 44 min including required 
and safety stops. 2 hours 30 min later he conducted a second 
dive from the shore to 35m for 44 min including required 
decompression and safety stops. Within 1 min of exiting the 
water from the second dive the diver was staggering and looked 
pale. He was de-kitted and laid down. The diver complained of 
feeling weak with pains in his right leg and back; he had shallow 
breathing and felt very cold. The diver was given oxygen from 
the remaining gas from a rebreather 2 ltr cylinder. A local 
recompression chamber was called but there was no response 
and so a call was made for an ambulance. A local instructor 
was passing and provided use of his oxygen kit during which a 
rash developed on the diver's stomach but the right leg 
improved and his breathing became easier. The diver was 
taken to hospital by ambulance and was on oxygen and a saline 
drip. A chest x-ray indicated lung barotrauma. A hyperbaric unit 
doctor indicated that the diver had only a 'skin DCI' and would 
only require a 2 hour treatment in a recompression chamber 
and would be alright to fly home in two days time. After 
recompression treatment the diver still complained of 'pins and 
needles' and weakness in his legs, he had low blood pressure 
and was feeling dehydrated. He was kept overnight in hospital 
and then given a further short treatment. He was informed he 
had suffered a spinal DCI which had come on during the night 
and he was kept in hospital for four days with further 
recompression treatments. The diver was then returned to the 
UK by air ambulance and received a further forty hours 
recompression treatment over the next ten days before being 
released. The diver continues to make slow progress towards a 
full recovery. The diver has since been found to have a PFO 
and is considering having it repaired. 
September 2010 10/232 
A diver conducted a series of dives over four days, Two dives a 
day for the first three days and three dives on the final day. 90 
min after the last dive she felt that the skin on the shoulder was 
hot and sore. A red patch appeared on her skin. A skin DCI was 
diagnosed and oxygen and fluids were administered. After 40 
min all signs and symptoms had disappeared. The diver 
refrained from diving for the rest of the holiday. 
 
 
Illness / Injury 
 
October 2009 10/024 
A diver on holiday joined a dive with a local dive centre to dive a 
wreck in 27-30m and a scenic swim afterwards in the cove 
looking at marine life. This was deeper than the diver's previous 
experience (23m), but he felt comfortable on the top of the 
wreck at 27m and subsequently dropped to a maximum of 30m. 
The dive briefing had been to return to the surface with 50 bar 
and the diver indicated to the guide when he had reached 120 
bar. During the swim back along the cove the diver's fin came 
loose and it was tightened with the assistance of the guide but 
this action and keeping pace with the other divers in the party 
was causing the diver's air consumption to increase. When the 
diver's contents were approaching 50 bar he signalled the guide 
and received a signal to ascend. The diver began his ascent but 
then noticed that the guide and the other diver were not 
following. He signalled again and once again received a further 
signal to ascend at which point it was clear that the guide and 
the other diver did not intend to surface at the same time. The 
diver continued his ascent alone and experienced difficulty 
obtaining a breath at 12m and so ascended as fast as possible 
to the surface. On the surface he made himself buoyant with the 
remaining gas in his cylinder. He was out of breath, weak and 
coughing up fluid. The boat responded to his calls for help and 
he was returned quickly to harbour and transported to hospital 
where he was found to be suffering from pulmonary oedema. 
He remained in hospital for two days receiving oxygen therapy 
and was then discharged. He was unable to fly for fifteen days 
and so had to make his way home to the UK overland.

A student diver during the first open water dive complained of 
discomfort in his ear. The dive was aborted and medical 
attention sought. The student was given medication and told not 
to dive for two weeks. 
November 2009 10/251 
Divers were returning to shore following a dive. Conditions were 
flat calm. The boat coxswain swerved to avoid an object in the 
water, which turned out to be a bird. Two divers standing behind 
the coxswain's position were knocked off their feet by the boat's

action and one landed on top of the other. The diver who was 
landed on complained of lower back pain. 
February 2010 10/053 
During a training dive a diver complained of discomfort in her 
ear. The dive was aborted and medical attention sought and the 
diver was given ear drops and informed to try again. The 
following day the diver conducted a dive to a maximum of 3m 
for 15 min but again felt discomfort in her ears. The diver was 
advised not to dive again for a week. 
February 2010 10/069 
During a training dive a student diver did not equalise their ears 
on descent to 3m. The dive was aborted and medical attention 
sought. The diver was advised not to dive for a week. 
March 2010 10/076 
During a training dive a diver could not equalise his ears on a 
descent to a maximum depth of 13m. The dive was aborted and 
medical advice sought.  The diver was advised not to dive for a 
week. 
March 2010 10/070 
A group of eight divers were preparing to dive from the shore. 
One pair of divers were fully kitted and walked approximately 
100m to the shore. Before reaching the water one of the divers 
fell over on the rocks. The buddy and other divers assisted and 
the diver complained of pain in her knee and elbow and had a 
small cut on her hand. The diver was able to flex the affected 
limbs and did not need an ambulance and could walk back to 
the car. The diver was advised to seek medical assistance and 
to apply ice and rest but was able to drive home. Subsequently 
the diver went to hospital and was diagnosed with a fractured 
lower leg and hospitalised for arthroscopic surgery to clean out 
the joint. The operation went well and no pins or screws were 
needed. 
June 2010 10/191 
An instructor and his student had completed a training dive to a 
maximum depth of 22m and total duration of 30 min. During the 
ascent the pair had been close together but on surfacing the 
student could not see the instructor and thought he may have 
dropped something or was switching off his shark shield. The 
instructor had experienced excruciating pain in his right ear 
during the ascent and had lost consciousness. The instructor 
was subsequently spotted face down and unmoving on the 
surface. The cover boat was moved towards him and another 
instructor entered the water and turned him over. He was found 
to be breathing through his regulator but he was unresponsive 
and his eyes were glazed. The diver was de-kitted in the water 
and a nearby boat came to help. The diver was recovered into 
the second boat due to it's lower freeboard. Oxygen was 
administered and the boat made for shore where the diver was 
met by an ambulance alerted by other boats. The diver was 
transported to hospital and diagnosed with a middle ear 
barotrauma. The diver was advised to refrain from diving for 
thirty days. 
July 2010 10/162 
During a sheltered water training dive to a maximum depth of 
4m a student complained of being unable to get his breath. His 
regulator was checked and found to be working normally. The 
lesson was abandoned. It was discovered that the student had 
recently had tonsillitis. The diver was sent for medical advice 
and told not to dive for two weeks. 
 
Boating and Surface 
 
November 2009 10/033 
On launching a boat for a trip to a shallow reef a problem was 
encountered with the tilt mechanism on the starboard engine of 
a twin engine boat. A trip to the workshop rectified the fault. On 
a previous trip a problem with the bilge pump running 
continuously had been reported but was thought to have been 
resolved. On arrival on site the boat tied up to a reef mooring 
buoy and the engines were switched off. Three pairs of divers, 
supported by a non-diving boat handler, completed two dives 
each in two waves. Once the final divers had returned to the 
boat and were safely onboard with equipment stowed the boat 
handler attempted to start the engines but found the batteries 
were flat. The local Coastguard was contacted by mobile phone 
because the boat radio would also not work due to lack of 
battery power. The local Coastguard attended within 20 min and 
provided a spare battery pack with which both engines were 
started. The boat then returned to port under its own power. 
The boat was booked in for maintenance and repairs. 
April 2010 10/089 
A group of divers were returning to harbour in their 8m boat 
after a day's diving on reefs and a night dive. During the return 
to port the masthead light stopped working. The cox continued 
with caution and posted a forward lookout to assist in identifying 
the marina entrance at night and avoiding a shallow reef. As 
they approached the harbour at a speed of 4 knots, within the 
harbour 5 knot limit, the lookout suddenly saw the underside of 
another boat rapidly approaching from the stern. The boat was 
estimated as travelling at 20-25 knots and, before an alarm 
could be raised, the second boat hit the stern of the boat on the 
starboard engine. The bows of the second boat were deflected 
upwards and onto an aluminium tube canopy structure of the 
first boat; this canopy collapsed. Four divers were sitting on the 
rear seat of the boat and the hull of the second boat narrowly 
missed one diver's head. The boat's starboard engine was non-
functional. The two boats separated and the crew checked for 
damage, reported the incident to the local Coastguard and took 
photographs of the other boat for identification. The boat then 
returned to harbour using it's port engine only. 
June 2010 10/149 
A pair of divers entered the water on the east side of an island 
for a planned dive of 45 min. They had previously conducted a 
dive on the west side and experienced no current. As the divers 
approached a corner towards the north point of the island, after 
approximately 28 min, they experienced a strong current that 
was impossible to swim against and so they decided to surface. 
The divers ascended completing a safety stop at 6m. When 
they surfaced they were already 500 m from the island. The 
surface cover boat did not see them surface but initiated a 
search 52 min after the divers had entered the water. Two other 
boats joined the search and the divers were located safe and 
well, 1 hour later, 3 km from the dive site. Their location was 
assisted by the divers deploying three delayed SMBs. 
 
 
Ascents 
 
October 2009 10/025 
A diver was conducting a simulated decompression dive as part 
of his diver training. At the end of the dive the diver ascended to 
the surface without conducting the simulated stops due to loss 
of buoyancy control. Interrogation of the dive computer did not 
indicate a fast ascent.

January 2010 10/066 
On the third day of a diving trip a diver was descending slowly 
with her buddy at the beginning of the dive. Due to problems 
clearing ears she was slightly above her buddy. At a depth of 
around 5m she heard a loud bang and felt she had been hit in 
the neck. She looked around and could see nothing and her 
contents gauge seemed to be fine and so she continued the 
descent. At approximately 14m she checked the gauge again 
and it showed zero. She could not see her buddy as he was 
directly below her and so she made a direct swimming ascent to 
the surface making a conscious effort to breathe out. The diver 
did not experience being out of gas but she surfaced with no 
gas remaining. Her buddy saw her ascending and followed but 
as she appeared to be safely on the surface he conducted a 
safety stop as indicated by his computer. Once recovered back 
into the boat the diver who had made the emergency ascent 
took oxygen and re-hydration fluids as a precaution. The diver 
experienced a slight ache in her bicep and so consulted a 
diving doctor who advised that the gentle dive profiles and 
nitrox use should mean that there would be no problems and 
further advised missing the first dive the next day. 
February 2010 10/224 
Two divers were decompressing after a dive to 40m. One of the 
divers reached back to dump air out of the kidney dump on her 
wing and in doing so air migrated in her drysuit to her feet.  This 
resulted in her feet being pulled from her drysuit boots and a fin 
being dislodged. In trying to resolve the situation the diver 
ascended feet first to the surface. Her buddy attempted to assist 
but was unable to and so he completed his decompression. The 
buddy surfaced to be recovered by a different boat as the 
buoyant diver was being taken back to shore. The diver was 
placed on oxygen and monitored but no symptoms of DCI 
presented. The diver now secures her boots with additional 
gaffer tape before a dive. 
June 2010 10/192 
Two divers were approaching the end of a dive to a maximum 
depth of 20m. One diver had deployed a delayed SMB and after 
approximately 30 min the valve on his inflate/deflate hose 
parted allowing low pressure air to escape. His buddy assisted 
in trying to disengage the valve from the hose but was 
unsuccessful. The diver took his buddy's octopus as a 
precaution . The divers were now at 10m and the delayed SMB 
line had become entangled around the diver's fins, which his 
buddy released. In doing so both divers arrived on the surface. 
Both divers were recovered and checked for any abnormalities. 
Both computers indicated fast ascent warnings but did not 
indicate missed stops. The divers continued to be monitored 
and no ill effects developed. Inspection of the equipment 
revealed that the threads of the plastic housing had stripped. 
September 2010 10/226 
A pair of divers conducted a no stop dive to 30m. At the end of 
the dive the more experienced diver went to deploy a delayed 
SMB but got tangled in the line and was pulled to the surface. 
The buddy was not aware of the deployment and when he 
missed his buddy he minimised his decompression and 
surfaced as quickly as possible. The more experienced diver 
was placed on oxygen and monitored but no symptoms 
developed. 
 
 
Technique 
 
March 2010 10/075 
A dive group had to relocate their planned dive site to an 
alternative more sheltered site due to adverse surface 
conditions. A sheltered bay was found and the average depth 
was determined (12m) using a plumb line. The group were 
briefed to limit dives to a maximum depth of 15m, to ensure 
they stayed away from deeper water with rougher surface 
conditions, for a maximum duration of 1 hour and no required 
decompression stops. One pair of divers, using closed circuit 
rebreathers, deployed a delayed SMB after 7 min and surfaced 
shortly afterwards having been to a maximum depth of 30m. All 
other divers in the group stayed inshore and did not exceed 
12m. 
June 2010 10/146 
A diver who had not dived for a number of months conducted 
his first dive abroad with an experienced buddy, whom he had 
dived with extensively, together with a group of seven other 
divers and a dive guide. The dive was to a maximum depth of 
22m and had a total duration of 40 min. Towards the end of the 
dive the diver's cylinder pressure gauge had fallen to 50 bar but 
the guide seemed to be continuing. The diver became 
concerned that he would not be able to ascend safely with the 
guide with reduced contents and so ascended using his buddy's 
alternate source from a depth of 16m to preserve a reserve of 
gas. Both divers surfaced safely. The dive group remained 
underwater for longer and many surfaced with less than 10 bar 
gas remaining. 
 
 
Equipment 
 
October 2009 10/021 
A diver was completing an uneventful dive. After completing an 
indicated 6m safety stop for 3 min he was continuing towards 
the surface when his buddies signalled him to stop. They 
indicated that they still had more stops to complete. On 
checking his dive computer the diver discovered it was 
reporting a 20m dive for 44 min. Comparison with his buddies' 
computers showed that the dive had been to a maximum depth 
of 27m and a duration of 50 min. A second dive was conducted 
using tables. The computer recorded a dive to 20m for a 
duration of 37 min. The depth of the second dive recorded by 
his buddy was 28m for a duration of 42 min. The computer was 
more than two years old. The manufacturer advised purchase of 
a new computer. 
January 2010 10/051 
An instructor was teaching a group of eight students practicing 
static alternate air source drills. One of the students' regulators 
developed a free flow. The instructor attempted to stop the free 
flow by tapping the regulator but this did not resolve the 
problem. The instructor then got the student to breathe from the 
alternate source of another student and then turned off the 
student's air supply to stop the free flow. Another instructor, who 
was in the vicinity but not part of the group, was called over by 
the first instructor who indicated to him that he should donate 
his alternate source to the student who was without gas and 
assist him to the surface. The second instructor did so and on 
the surface found that he could not inflate the student's BCD 
with the direct feed and so inflated his own jacket in order to 
support the student. He got the student to orally inflate his BCD 
and then both exited the water. The first instructor continued 
teaching the remaining seven students in his group. 
February 2010 10/054 
A dive guide was leading a group on a dive and the whole 
group were making their way to the anchor line for a safety stop 
when one of the divers ran out of air. The diver tried to get to 
the dive guide for assistance but he was too far away and so 
the diver made his way to the surface without a source of gas. 
The dive guide followed him to the surface, checked he was

alright and then brought him back down to 6m using the guide's 
alternate source and they completed an extended safety stop of 
around 5 min. After the dive the diver was monitored for signs of 
DCI but none were found. The diver's contents gauge was 
found to be reading 60 bar even though the cylinder was empty. 
March 2010 10/078 
Three divers entered the water for a planned dive on a wreck to 
a maximum depth of 42m for a maximum of 45 min duration to 
include no more than 8 min decompression stops. Two divers 
were using open circuit equipment and one was using a closed 
circuit rebreather. After 10 min the rebreather diver's 
mouthpiece came away at depth. The diver bailed out onto his 
inboard bailout. He was unable to fix the problem and so 
switched to his off-board bailout and aborted the dive. During 
the ascent there was a problem with the contents gauge on the 
off-board bailout cylinder and so the ascent was completed on 
the alternate source of one of the open circuit divers. On 
surfacing the divers swam back to the boat which was moored 
to the dive site. 
June 2010 10/147 
A student was about to enter sheltered water for a training dive 
when his high pressure hose burst. The hose was replaced and 
training resumed. No injuries occurred.
