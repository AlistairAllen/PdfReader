Introduction 
 
This booklet contains the 2012 Diving Incidents Report, produced by British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC) in the interest 
of promoting diving safety.  It is important to note that it contains details of UK sports diving incidents occurring 
to divers of all affiliations, plus incidents occurring worldwide involving BSAC members.  
The 2012 ‘Incident Year’ ran from 1st October 2011 to 30th September 2012. 
 
Report Format 
The majority of statistical information contained within this report is also shown in graphical form.  Please note that all 
statistical information is produced from UK data only and does not include Overseas Incidents unless noted as ‘All 
Incidents’. 
The contents of this report are split into an overview of the year, and then the details of nine incident categories plus some 
historical analyses.  The various sections can be found as shown below:- 
 
 i) Overview Page  1 
 ii) Fatalities Page 6 
 iii) Decompression Incidents Page 10 
 iv) Injury / illness Page  21 
 v) Boating & Surface Incidents Page  28 
 vi) Ascent Incidents Page  35 
 vii) Technique Incidents Page  40 
 viii) Equipment Incidents Page  42 
 ix) Miscellaneous Incidents Page  45 
 x) Overseas Incidents Page  47 
 xi) Numerical & Statistical Analyses Page  52 
 xii) List of Abbreviations Page  54 
 
Within each category the incidents are listed in the order of their occurrence, not necessarily that of Incident Reference.  
They are laid out in the following form: 
 
  MONTH/YEAR OF INCIDENT  INCIDENT REF.    
  Brief Narrative of Incident.................................................................................... 
  ........................................................................................................ 
 
The nature of many diving incidents is such that there is usually more than one cause or effect.  Where this is the case the 
incident has been classified under the more appropriate cause or effect. For instance an incident involving a fast ascent, 
causing decompression illness, will be classified under 'Decompression Incidents'.

Overview 
 
has seen 314 UK diving incidents reported.  The 
number of reports received in recent years has 
been fairly consistent at around 370; so this year 
represents a 15% drop.   
There are a number of possible reasons for this:-  
? A normal amount of diving has taken place but:- 
o It has been safer and fewer incidents have occurred. 
o A normal number of incidents have occurred but 
fewer have been reported. 
? Less diving has taken place and thus fewer incidents 
have occurred, leading to fewer reports. 
 
It would be nice if the first reason was found to be the cause of 
the reduction (safer diving) but it seems almost certain that the 
true reason is that there has simply been less diving in the UK 
in this period.

The distribution of reported incidents by month is shown in the 
following chart.  Normally about 70% of diving incidents take 
place in the summer months (April to August); this year, very 
unusually, it has only been 62%.

Normally the distribution of incidents by month follows a 
sinusoidal form with the lowest number of dives in December 
and January, rising to a peak in June and July.  This year's 
distribution shows a clear 'plateau' during the summer period at 
around 40 incidents per month being reported.  In a normal year 
the number of reported incidents would have risen to a peak of 
about 60 in June and July.  This plateau accounts for the 
reduced number of incidents reported in the 2012 incident year.  
So, up until April an expected number of incidents were 
reported but in May, June, July and August that number is 
depressed.  This period clearly coincides with the appalling 
weather conditions that the UK suffered this summer.  So the 
clear conclusion is that less diving took place during this time.  
The only other possibility is that for some unknown reason 
diving became safer in just these four months and that seems 
very implausible.  
Incidentally, August and September's totals are always 
somewhat depressed, each year, as a result of the time that it 
takes for reports to reach us.  Each year a number of reports 
are received after our cut-off period for the annual report.  
These reports are included in the database for future research 
purposes but they are not included in the annual report. 
 
 
Incidents by category 
The incident database assigns all incidents into one of nine 
major categories, and the following chart shows the distribution 
of the 2012 incidents into those categories.

0 20 40 60 80 100

Ascents
Injury / Illness
Boat / surface
DCI
 
In 2011 'Boating and Surface' incidents was the largest 
category and it had been ten years since this group had topped 
the list.  This year sees a return to the normal situation where 
cases of 'DCI' are the biggest single category with 'Boating and 
Surface' incident back to its normal second place.   
 
Cases of 'DCI' have been following a slight downward trend 
over the last ten years and this year's total of 83 continues that 
trend.  
 
Incidents involving 'Boating and Surface' events had been 
falling progressively since the late 90s.  In the previous three 
years this number had jumped back up to levels seen 10 years 
earlier.  This year 73 incidents were recorded and this is much 
more in line with the earlier downward trend.   
This category mainly comprises of problems with boat engines 
(engine failure and out of fuel) and lost diver(s).

The third category is 'Illness and Injury' with 51 incidents 
reported.  The bulk of this is thought to be cases of DCI.  But 
these cases are reported through the RNLI and their reports do 
not specifically record DCI, they often just state ‘Diver illness’.  
For this reason it is not possible to distinguish cases of DCI 
from other diver ailments.  51 cases is a little below the average 
of recent years. 
 
‘Ascents’ is the fourth category and this involves incidents  
where divers have made an abnormal ascent but avoided DCI 
or other injury.  This category peaked in 2006 and has been 
steadily falling since that time.  It is good to see that this trend 
has continued in the 2012 incident year.  45 'Ascent' related 
incidents were reported and one has to go back to 1999 to find 
a lower number.  A lot of effort has been put into improving 
diver buoyancy control and these numbers reflect the beneficial 
changes that have been made.   
 
The last category to be mentioned specifically is ‘Fatalities’ and 
although the numbers are quite small it is, of course, the most 
serious.  This year saw 17 diver fatalities; this is somewhat 
above the average of the preceding ten years which was 14.7. 
 
More analysis on these key incident categories is given later in 
the report.  
 
At this point it is important to remember the conclusion that less 
diving has taken place this year.  Less diving will mean fewer 
incidents, so lower numbers in all categories are to be 
expected.  So a lower number does not automatically imply 
improved safety.   
 
    
Incident depths 
The following chart shows the maximum depth of the dives 
during which incidents took place, categorised into depth range 
groupings.

The pattern of depths in the 0m to 50m range is very similar to 
that normally seen and reflects the amount of diving that takes 
place in these depth ranges.   
The number of incidents reported in the greater than 50m 
ranges is 13, very similar to previous years.  However it is worth 
noting that 3 of these 13 incidents involved fatalities; although, 
in one of these 3 cases, depth was not a relevant factor. 
  
BSAC advises that no air dive should be deeper than 50m, and 
that dives to 50m should only be conducted by divers who are 
appropriately trained and qualified.   
 
The recommended limit for divers trained to Sports Diver 
standard is 35m and then only when they have received 
appropriate training for diving at this depth. 
BSAC recommends that helium mixtures are used for depths 
deeper than 40m and that mixed gas diving should be to a 
maximum depth of 80m.  Mixed gas dives should only be 
conducted when the diver holds a recognized qualification to 
conduct such dives.  
See the BSAC website for more details of these and other 
diving depth limit recommendations.  
 
The next chart shows the depths at which incidents started.

Inevitably the data are biased towards the shallower depths 
since many incidents happen during the ascent or at the 
surface.  Critical among these are the DCI cases where almost 
always the casualty is out of the water before any problems are 
noted.  This partially explains the large occurrence of ‘Surface’ 
cases as this includes divers with DCI who have left the water. 
Other surface incidents involve boats and boating incidents and 
divers who are lost but on the surface. 
 
The depth profiles are consistent with previous years. 
 
 
Diver qualifications 
The next two charts show the qualification of those BSAC 
members who were involved in reported incidents.    
The first looks at the diver qualification.

These data are in line with the normal pattern of previous years 
and are thought to reflect the number of divers in these 
qualification grades.

The low number for ‘Club’ instructor almost certainly reflects the 
fact that this qualification is no longer part of the instructor 
development programme.   
 
 
 
Divers’ use of the Emergency Services 
Divers’ use of the emergency services shows a monthly 
distribution aligned to the distribution of all incidents, and is 
clearly correlated with the number of dives that are taking place.  
These charts reflect the April to August 'plateau' that was 
highlighted earlier in the report. 
 
174 incidents were reported to us by the Coastguard.  The 
average number of incidents reported by the Coastguard in 
recent years is just over 200.  This picture supports the 
conclusion that there was less diving than normal in the 
summer months this year.

There were 83 incidents reported that involved the RNLI.  
Earlier years had seen a steady decline in divers’ need for 
lifeboat assistance.  However the previous three years saw that 
trend reversed.  This year's total is in line with the earlier 
downward trend.   
The RNLI’s main support to divers involves assistance with 
disabled boats, searching for missing divers and the recovery of 
divers with DCI.   
These data also reflect the dip in the early summer months.

In 2012 86 incidents involved the use of helicopters.  This is 
lower than normal and again reflects the reduced number of 
dives that have taken place.  
 
In diving related incidents helicopters are mainly tasked to 
support searches for missing divers and to transport divers with 
DCI to recompression facilities.

Fatalities 
17 fatal incidents occurred in the UK during the 2012 incident 
year.  This is above the average of 14.7 fatalities per year over 
the previous ten years.  However, given the small numbers 
involved, this is not thought to be a significant increase.   
 
10 of these people were BSAC members.  The previous ten 
year average for BSAC fatalities in the UK is 5.6 fatalities per 
year, so this represents a substantial increase.  It is necessary 
to go back to 1988 to find a previous year that matches this 
number.

7 of the year's fatalities were non-BSAC members.  The 
previous ten year average for this group is 9.1.  So this year's 
total is normal. 
 
Key factors associated with these fatalities can be summarised 
as follows:- 
? Four cases involved divers who suffered a 'non-diving' 
related medical incident whilst in the water.  Additionally 
there are seven other cases where it seems very likely that 
the diver suffered a 'medical event' whilst underwater, 
although evidence to substantiate this assumption is not 
currently available. 
? Five cases involved a separation of some kind.  Three of 
these cases involved divers who made a conscious 
decision to separate during the dive.  The other two cases 
involved separation that occurred as a result of some other 
developing problem.  Separation in itself is not a cause of 
death but death might have been avoided if the casualties' 
buddies had been with them and thus potentially able to 
help resolve any subsequent problems. 
? Four cases involved divers who were using rebreathers.  In 
two case the use of the rebreather does not appear to be a 
relevant factor.  In the other two cases the divers were lost, 
so no conclusions are currently possible.  
? Three cases involved divers who were diving alone.  In two 
cases the divers elected to conduct the dive alone; in one of 
these cases the diver was lost and in the other the diver 
was recovered unconscious from underwater.  In the third 
case a diver chose to abort a dive during the descent and 
ascended alone.  In this case it seems unlikely that the 
diver would have survived even if he had been 
accompanied.   
? Three cases involved divers diving in a group of three or 
more.  In one case the number of divers present was 
probably not a relevant factor in the fatality; in the other two 
cases it probably was.  
? Three cases involved dives to greater than 50m.  The 
depths involved were 55m, 65m and 70m.  Only thirteen 
incidents were reported involving dives to greater than 50m; 
three of these were fatalities.  However, the 70m incident 
involved a diver who (unknowingly) suffered a serious 
physical trauma immediately before the dive, so the depth is 
not particularly relevant in this case.   
? Two incidents involved divers running out of gas, or divers 
who thought that they had run out of gas. 
 
Often multiple causes were involved in an incident and with 
many of these fatal incidents there is currently insufficient 
information available to be clear about the exact chain of events 
and specific root causes.  Often new information comes to light 
(from coroners’ inquests for example) after the publication of the 
annual report.  Such information is added to the incident 
database for future research purposes.   
 
Diver age has been highlighted in recent years as a feature of 
note in the year’s fatal incidents, with a disproportionate rate of 
fatalities amongst older divers.  This year sees a strong 
continuation of this trend;  11 (65%) of the 2012 fatalities 
involved divers over the age of 50 (and 2 were actually 50).  
This is against a background of only 16% of the diving 
population being over 50 (from a BSAC UK site survey).  
The natural tendency is for health and fitness to decline with 
increasing age and the above numbers seem to indicate that 
divers need to pay more attention to these aspects as they grow 
older. 
A natural and obvious response to this is to consider mandatory 
medicals.  However, expert diving medical opinion is that it is 
not possible to screen for latent medical problems.  Accurate 
and honest reporting in the medical declaration form and 
subsequent follow-up, if necessary, is the correct approach.  
This is the current policy advocated by BSAC and others. 
Decompression incidents 
The BSAC database contains 83 reports of ‘DCI’ incidents in 
the 2012 incident year, some of which involved more than one 
casualty.  When these multiple cases are counted the result is 
91 cases of DCI. 
 
An analysis of the causal factors associated with the 83 
incidents reported in 2012 indicates the following major 
features:- 
20 involved repeat diving  
18 involved rapid ascents 
18 involved diving to deeper than 30m 
  9 involved missed decompression stops  
Some cases involved more than one of these factors. 
 
The content and order of this list is virtually identical to previous 
years. 
As stated earlier, some of the ‘Injury and Illness’ incidents are 
also thought to be DCI related.   
 
 
 
Boating and Surface incidents 
This category of incident has dropped back to earlier levels with 
a total of 73 incidents reported.  The factors associated with 
these incidents are as follows:- 
 29 involved lost diver(s) 
 22 involved engine problems 
 14 involved boat problems 
   8 involved bad seamanship 
Some cases involved more than one of these factors. 
 
 
 
Ascent related incidents 
Ascent related incidents have been falling in recent years and 
this year sees that trend continuing with 45 cases reported.  As 
in previous years the majority of these were ‘rapid ascents’.   
An analysis of these ‘rapid ascents’ (where the detail is known) 
is as follows:- 
 41% Simply poor buoyancy control  
 26% Panic / anxiety / rush for surface  
 21% Drysuit control malfunction/mis-use  
  15% Out of air / gas 
     10% Regulator free flows 
 10% Weighting or weight related problems 
              5% Delayed SMB problems 
 
These causal factors are very similar to those seen in abnormal 
ascents for many previous years. 
 
It is certain that many other such cases have gone un-reported 
but it is anticipated that these root causes will apply to all 
uncontrolled ascents.   
 
Many DCI cases have their roots in these problems; they have 
been recorded under the ‘DCI’ heading but the causal factors 
are the same, so the actual number of abnormal ascents will be 
significantly higher than 45 cases.   
This year’s DCI cases included 18 incidents where rapid 
ascents had taken place.

Conclusions 
Key conclusions are:- 
? The number of incidents reported this year is about 15% 
lower than the level of recent years.  This reduction is due 
to a lower number of incidents reported in the period April to 
August.  It is believed that this is due to the very poor 
weather conditions in the UK during this period resulting in 
a reduced amount of diving taking place.   
? The number of fatalities of BSAC members is substantially 
higher that the average of the previous 10 years. 
? The number of fatalities of non-BSAC members is 2.1 lower 
than the average of the previous 10 years. 
? The causal factors associated with these fatalities and other 
incidents are very similar to those seen over a number of 
years; no new causal factors have been identified.  
? Diver age and related health and fitness issues are still 
featuring as critical factors in this and recent years’ 
fatalities.  The average age of the subjects of this year’s 
diving fatalities was 52.4 years (in line with recent years); 
the average age of the background diving population is 38.  
However, a number of the fatalities of 'older divers' had no 
apparent age related cause. 
? Incidents of DCI continue to fall. 
? Ascent related incidents continue to reduce. 
? Incidents relating to 'Boating & Surface' events have 
dropped back to earlier levels.  
? The above conclusions need to be viewed in the light of a 
probable overall reduction in the amount of UK diving that 
has taken place in this period.   
 
 
As has been stated many times before, most of the incidents 
reported within this document could have been avoided had 
those involved followed a few basic principles of safe diving 
practice.  The BSAC publishes a booklet called 'Safe Diving' 
(latest edition published in June 2011). which summarises all 
the key elements of safe diving and is available to all, free of 
charge, from the BSAC website or through BSAC HQ. 
 
Remember you can never have too much practice and the 
further you stay away from the limits of your own personal 
capabilities the more likely you are to continue to enjoy your 
diving. 
 
Please browse through the details in this report and use them to 
learn from others’ mistakes. They have had the courage and 
generosity to record their experiences for publication, the least 
that we can do is to use this information to avoid similar 
problems. 
 
Finally, if you must have an incident please report it using our 
Incident Report form, available free via the BSAC website or 
from BSAC HQ. 
As always, your anonymity is assured – great care is taken to 
preserve the confidentiality of any personal information 
recorded in BSAC Incident Reports.

Fatalities 
 
October 2011 12/122 
Three divers entered the water and descended to a wreck in a 
depth of 49m.  They explored the wreck together for a while and 
then one of the three left the others to dive alone.  After about 
40 min the two divers agreed to terminate the dive and both 
divers deployed a DSMB.  These two divers were using 
rebreathers with trimix.  One of these divers had planned to 
make his first stop at 18m however when they got to 36m he 
indicated, with an out-stretched hand, that they should level off.  
His buddy noticed that he seemed to be having problems with 
buoyancy control; when he put air into his drysuit it appeared to 
come straight out of the shoulder dump.  They ascended to 30m 
where the diver who had had buoyancy problems was seen to 
be adjusting his mouthpiece; he did not indicate any problems.  
The other diver looked away to wind in his DSMB line and when 
he looked back his buddy was not there.  He looked around, 
could see no signs of his missing buddy and made a normal 
ascent to the surface with 34 min of decompression.  The 
missing diver had gone straight to the surface.  At the surface 
he called for help and got back on the boat.  He was placed on 
oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  He was airlifted to a 
recompression facility but he suffered a heart attack and died 
while undergoing recompression treatment. 
October 2011 12/002 
A diver was seen to descend rapidly past the rest of the group, 
using the line for reference, and contact was lost with him. The 
rest of the group reached the bottom in low visibility.  After a 
short period of time they discovered one of the lone diver's fins, 
and assumed he had ascended.  Upon returning to the surface 
it became clear he had not.   The dive vessel requested 
assistance from the Coastguard when the diver was 15 min 
overdue. Two divers returned to depth and located his body.  
He was brought to the surface. The casualty's weightbelt was 
on, and his cylinder mostly full, although his drysuit inflator was 
found not to have been connected.   Shetland MRCC requested 
the immediate launch of Stromness lifeboat and helicopter R-
137.  Kirkwall coast rescue team awaited helicopter arrival at 
Kirkwall airport, the casualty was recovered and transferred to 
the ALB from where he was winched aboard R-137 and 
evacuated to the HLS.  An ambulance transferred the casualty 
to Balfour hospital in Kirkwall. The casualty was declared dead.  
It was reported at the inquest that the diver had suffered a heart 
attack as a result of a blocked artery.  The diver was described 
at the inquest as a very fit person. 
November 2011 12/003 
Two divers were the last pair to enter the water from a charter 
boat. They entered the water and drifted towards the shotline.  
The lead diver allowed time for his buddy to acclimatise and 
catch his breath and then signalled to descend and received an 
OK signal. The buddy struggled a bit to get down; the dive 
leader maintained eye contact and saw no sign of distress. After 
failing to descend, the pair surfaced and the dive leader noticed 
that the buddy was having difficulty breathing. The dive leader 
made the diver buoyant and removed his weight pouches.  He 
signalled distress to the boat then began towing clear of the site 
to allow the boat room for pick-up. The casualty was 
subsequently found to have stopped breathing and rescue 
breaths were commenced whilst a rope was thrown from the 
boat. The diver was recovered into the boat and CPR started.  
An RNLI lifeboat had been on exercise nearby and arrived 
shortly after a 'Mayday' call was made.  The casualty was 
transferred to the lifeboat which brought him back to shore. The 
diver did not survive.  A subsequent Coroner's inquest found 
death was due to natural causes and that there were underlying 
medical issues. 
February 2012 12/008 
A diver commenced a dive with his buddy and shortly into the 
dive indicated that he didn't feel well.  His buddy raised him up 
to the surface where the diver was unresponsive. The 
emergency services were alerted and the diver was airlifted to 
hospital where he was declared dead.  It was reported that the 
diver had suffered a heart attack.

April 2012 12/011 
A diver was accompanied on a depth experience dive by an 
instructor at an inland site. Following an exploratory dive to a 
maximum depth of 35m the pair were following a guideline back 
up an underwater roadway. As they approached 30m the diver 
signalled and then took the instructor's alternate source. The 
pair started to follow the guideline.  The diver seemed to allow 
the regulator to twist in his mouth and the instructor tried to 
replace it but the diver was less responsive. The instructor 
decided to initiate an ascent but the diver became unresponsive 
and gripped the line tightly. The instructor attempted to inflate 
the diver's BCD and then his own but the response was too 
slow and so he jettisoned weights and the pair ascended to the 
surface where the alarm was raised. The instructor commenced 
rescue breaths until the rescue boat came alongside.  The diver 
was recovered and returned him to shore where CPR was 
conducted until the arrival of paramedics and an ambulance. 
The diver did not recover. 
May 2012 12/012 
The divers carried out kit set up and full dive planning.  They 
planned a no stop dive with simulated deco stops using nitrox 
50. The group consisted of three student divers and one 
instructor plus one safety/assistant diver. After a briefing, the 
group swam to the descent point and everyone signalled 'OK'. 
They dropped to 4m to carry out a bubble check, then continued 
their descent to 31m. At 31m one of the students turned to the 

 NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2012    
?BSAC - 2012  7 
assistant diver for help as he had a free flow. He was able to 
switch to his pony cylinder whilst the assistant diver shut down 
his back gas. The student remained on the pony because the 
ascent was about to begin, and they would be switching to a 7 lt 
nitrox 50 cylinder at 18m.  The two divers swam closer to the 
rest of the group, and at this point the instructor signalled to the 
group to deploy their SMBs. The instructor was helping a 
student who was having a slight buoyancy control issue with 
their SMB deployment. The assistant diver deployed his and 
locked the reel in ratchet mode. He then saw the student who 
had had the free flow racing upwards in front of him. The 
assistant diver swam after him, grabbed him by a fin and 
dumped air from his BCD to arrested his ascent.  He brought 
him back down to the bottom but the student was distressed 
and panicking.  The student was tangled in his SMB line and 
the assistant diver need to use both hands to untangle him as 
his line was wrapped around his waist and around his cylinder 
and his movements were making it worse.  Once the line was 
cut free the student looked panicked and made frantic out-of-air 
signals using the cut throat signal. He was given the assistant 
diver's primary second stage and the assistant switched to his 
back-up. They made the decision to escort him directly to the 
surface and signalled an ascent. The troubled student 
immediately grabbed the assistant and started finning upwards 
very rapidly. The only means they had to slow the ascent were 
pulling down on the inflator hose dump valve and not finning. At 
all times during the ascent to the surface the troubled student 
had a primary second stage in his mouth. Upon surfacing, the 
student appeared to move and was floating on his back with his 
BCD fully inflated. The assistant turned towards the shore and 
signalled for help.  The emergency response team arrived and 
the student was helped out of his equipment and into the boat.  
The boat took the student to the quayside where they began 
performing CPR.   There were no obvious injuries to the 
casualty's face, but blood was originating from the nose and 
mouth. The majority of his drysuit was removed and there was 
bruising to the top of his arms.  Resuscitation efforts continued 
along with help from the paramedics, however he did not 
respond and was pronounced dead after 45 min. 
May 2012 12/013 
A group of three divers were exploring a wreck in a maximum 
depth of 24m.  About 40 min into the dive they attempted to 
pass through a hole in a bulkhead between two of the ship's 
holds.  In the process silt became stirred up and one of the 
divers became separated. The other two waited for him and 
then began to search.  On two occasions they saw his torch 
light in the wreck but they were unable to get to him.  Disturbed 
silt made their search much more difficult.  They continued to 
search for a further 10 min before starting their ascent.  The two 
divers surfaced expecting to find their buddy and, when he 
didn't surface, they took additional gas supplies and re-entered 
the water to search for him. They could find no trace of the 
missing diver and so left a line marking his last known position 
and surfaced. The Coastguard was alerted and surface 
searches were conducted by a helicopter and lifeboat as well as 
other surface craft, along with further underwater searches but 
no sign was found of the missing diver. The diver's body was 
discovered in the vicinity of the wreck two days later by Royal 
Navy and police divers and it was recovered. 
May 2012 12/014 
Three divers entered the water for a dive on a wreck at 55m. 
During the descent one of the divers, who was second on the 
line, had problems with his ears and so paused and ascended 
slightly. He was passed by the third diver who continued his 
descent. The diver with ear problems managed to clear them 
and continued his descent.  On the way he was passed by a 
diver ascending who he assumed was the third diver in the 
group but was unsure due to poor visibility. As the two divers 
reached the wreck they found that the visibility was very poor 
and decided to abort the dive and ascend. On regaining the 
boat they discovered that the diver who had passed them was 
not their buddy but another diver who had also decided to abort 
due to the poor underwater visibility. The pair de-kitted and 
waited for their buddy to surface. After a time they became 
concerned as no DSMB was evident but they could see bubbles 
away from the shotline. One of the divers was preparing to kit 
up in order to look for the missing third diver when a DSMB 
surfaced but was not fully inflated. The kitted diver was still 
concerned and so entered the water and descended the DSMB 
line. He found the missing buddy but was concerned that the 
DSMB line was not taut and that his main cylinder was down to 
15 bar, although his decompression cylinder had not been 
used. The diver decided to assist the buddy to the surface and 
on regaining the boat it was discovered that the missing diver 
had not completed his safety stops. The diver complained of 
feeling unwell and asked to lie down. Shortly after the diver's 
condition deteriorated; CPR was commenced and the 
Coastguard was alerted.  CPR continued until the arrival of a 
rescue helicopter which airlifted the unconscious diver to 
hospital but he did not survive. (Coastguard report). 
May 2012 12/015 
A pair of rebreather divers were the first pair of a group of divers 
to enter the water for a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 37m. 
The other divers were on open circuit and conducted a shorter 
dive than the rebreather divers. Following an uneventful dive 
the pair of rebreather divers returned to the shotline.  One of the 
divers prepared to release the grapnel and noted his buddy 
clipping off his torch. After releasing the grapnel the diver turned 
but could not see his buddy. He conducted a search of the area 
and then, when he could not find him, assumed that he had 
ascended the shotline to start his decompression. The diver 
ascended and completed his own decompression requirements 
but did not see his buddy again and surfaced on the shotline. 
Around the time of the separation, the missing buddy's DSMB 
had surfaced and was monitored by the charter boat skipper. As 
the buddy became overdue one of the divers on the boat re-
entered the water and followed the DSMB line down to 30m to 
find the reel but no sign of the diver. The Coastguard had been 
alerted to the overdue diver and a surface search was 
conducted involving two lifeboats, a warship, a rescue 
helicopter and other surface craft. The current had started 
running and so an immediate underwater search was not 
possible. Three divers entered the water on the next slack and 
conducted a search in very poor visibility; they did not find the 
missing diver. Over subsequent days searches were conducted 
by police divers but no sign of the missing diver was found. 
June 2012 12/016 
A group of divers had been diving from the shore in windy 
conditions. They were diving from a sheltered gully to a 
maximum depth of 12m and all had completed a dive from the 
site in the morning without problems. A few of the group had 
completed a second dive also without incident and a couple had 
left the site to start the journey home but several divers were 
still available to act as shore cover. Underwater conditions were 
of good visibility, 3-4m, and whilst there was a small amount of 
surge there was no current underwater. A pair of divers entered 
the water for their second dive and were seen to surface in the 
mouth of the gully 18 min later and they signalled for help. One 
diver drifted out of the gully whilst the other swam to some 
rocks and clambered onto them. He was subsequently swept off 
the rock by a wave and was then seen face down on the 
surface and appeared unresponsive. Two members of the 
group entered the water and recovered the unconscious diver 
back to shore. The Coastguard was alerted at the same time. 
Once on shore CPR was commenced with oxygen enriched 
rescue breaths. CPR continued until a rescue helicopter airlifted 
the diver to hospital in Edinburgh. The diver did not recover.  
The diver's buddy managed to swim to and climb out onto rocks

where he was subsequently recovered by a lifeboat crew and 
returned to shore without injury but suffering from shock.

A pair of divers completed a 27 min dive to a maximum depth of 
24m and made a 1 min stop at 9m and a 3 min stop at 6m on 
their ascent.  They ascended the boat's anchor line and arrived 
at the surface normally.  One of the pair moved to the ladder 
towards the rear of the boat while her buddy stayed on the 
anchor line submerged to avoid surface conditions and to 
prevent congestion at the ladder.  The first diver stood on the 
ladder but did not climb it.  She said words that suggested she 
was caught on something and it is thought that it was her reel 
line caught on the ladder.  Her mouthpiece was replaced and 
she sank back into the water.  She was not seen again.  The 
buddy was recovered and a search conducted in the area down 
wind and tide.  The Coastguard was alerted.  A helicopter, three 
lifeboats and other craft carried out a search but the missing 
diver was not found.  The diver's body was recovered from the 
shoreline twenty four days later. 
July 2012 12/111 
Three divers entered the water and descended to a wreck in a 
maximum depth of 65m.  One of the three was using a 
rebreather.  This diver conducted his dive solo, once 
underwater.  The other two divers report seeing him towards the 
end of the dive in the vicinity of the shotline.  They say that he 
looked confused and one of the pair pointed towards the 
shotline.  The two divers ascended safely but the solo diver 
failed to surface.  The Coastguard was alerted and a search 
was initiated involving two lifeboats, a helicopter and other 
surface craft.  Later divers conducted a search of the wreck and 
the immediate area but the missing diver was not found. 
July 2012 12/112 
A diver and his buddy prepared to enter the water to dive a 
wreck.  One of the pair stated that he felt a bit sick but would be 
fine once in the water.  This diver entered the water first and his 
buddy followed.  Initially the buddy went towards the wrong shot 
buoy and, realising the error, moved towards the correct buoy.  
As the buddy swam towards the diver who had felt sick he 
noticed that the diver did not have his regulator in his mouth 
and that his mask was displaced.  The buddy shouted for help.  
The troubled diver then started to sink.  The buddy was able to 
grab the sinking diver's BCD hose.  The buddy tried to put his 
octopus regulator into the diver's mouth but he was 
unresponsive.  The buddy tried to inflate the diver's BCD and he 
managed to drop his weights.  The boat's skipper, alerted to the 
problem, sent two other divers in to help.  They got the diver 
onto the boat's lift and he was recovered into the boat.  
Resuscitation techniques were applied and the Coastguard was 
alerted.  The diver was airlifted to hospital but he failed to 
recover.  Examination of the casualty's equipment showed that 
his regulators were functioning normally and that his BCD was 
partially inflated.  The Coastguard report states that this was the 
diver's first sea dive for twelve years.  He had done two recent 
fresh water dives and was wearing an additional weightbelt to 
compensate for the increased water density.  He still had one 
weightbelt on when recovered.  It is thought that the diver had 
suffered a heart attack. 
August 2012 12/113 
Two divers entered the water from the shore after a thorough 
buddy check.  One of the pair was diving with a relatively new 
twin-set and he wanted to use the dive to increase his familiarity 
with the equipment.  They swam on the surface and then 
descended to a depth of 2m.  They continued the dive for 10 to 
15 min to a maximum depth of 5m.  Visibility was very poor and 
they surfaced to check their bearings, dived again but surfaced 
soon afterwards as the visibility was so poor. They started a 
surface swim to the shore.  On the way the diver with the new 
equipment suggested that they dive again as he wasn't 
comfortable with his kit.  On the seabed, at 3m, the diver 
adjusted his harnesses, indicated that he was happy and that 
they should ascend.  At the surface the other diver noticed that 
the diver had no regulator in his mouth.  He grabbed hold of him 
and tried to support him.  He tried to give the troubled diver his 
octopus regulator but he would not take it.  The rescuing diver 
inflated his own BCD and suit.  He tried to inflate the casualty's 
BCD but the hose was not connected.  He tried to reconnect it 
but couldn't.  He tried giving the casualty his own main regulator 
but this was not accepted.  He dropped the casualty's 
weightbelt but he was still sinking.  He struggled to remove his 
twin-set.  The set got caught in a number of places and caused 
the casualty to invert.  Once free, the casualty floated to the 
surface and the rescuing diver quickly righted him.  He 
attempted rescue breaths but could not support the casualty at 
the surface to do so.  He signalled distress and pulled the 
casualty onto his chest to support him.  He then commenced 
towing him to some nearby rocks while using his octopus 
regulator to try to get some air into the casualty.  The 
Coastguard was alerted.  Other divers arrived and the casualty 
was lifted onto the rocks.  Resuscitation techniques were 
applied.  Oxygen was used and the casualty was taken by 
lifeboat and ambulance to hospital where he was pronounced 
dead on arrival. 
August 2012 12/114 
A diver was preparing to dive on a wreck in a depth of 100m 
using a rebreather.  As he moved towards the entry point he 
slipped and fell to the deck.  He was assisted to a bench to 
recover and the boat was repositioned.  Meanwhile his buddy, 
who had already entered the water, commenced his dive alone.  
The diver who had fallen then entered the water with another 
pair and began his descent.  At 70m this diver decided to abort 
the dive and made his way back up the shotline.  He passed a 
pair who were decompressing at 50m.  They reported that he 
looked distressed and was breathing heavily.  A little later they 
looked up and saw the diver motionless above them with his 
mouthpiece out of his mouth.  They moved up to him and 
attempted, unsuccessfully, to replace his mouthpiece.  They 
inflated his BCD and sent him to the surface.  The diver was 
recovered into the boat and resuscitation techniques were 
applied.  The Coastguard was alerted and the diver was airlifted 
to hospital where he was declared dead. It is reported that 

 NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2012    
?BSAC - 2012  9 
cause of death was drowning as a result of the effects of 
serious internal injuries caused by the earlier fall. 
August 2012 12/115 
A diver was conducting a dive to a wreck in a maximum depth 
of 48m.  The diver and his buddy were using air in independent 
12 lt twin cylinders and nitrox 80 as decompression gas for 
accelerated decompression. The diver had changed his 
configuration and had attached his 7 lt decompression cylinder 
to his twin-set as a back-mount. This required his cylinder to be 
switched on before the dive. The regulator and contents gauge 
were each marked with tape and were routed down the diver's 
right hand side, which was the same side as his primary 
regulators. The pair entered the water and the diver's buddy 
waited for him at 6m.  When the pair were together they 
switched on their torches and descended. The buddy 
descended the shotline ahead of the diver who did not follow as 
quickly as normal. On arrival at the wreck the diver tied off his 
marker strobe alongside the 3 others on the shotline. There was 
a slight current on the wreck and the pair began to explore the 
wreck.  After exploring the stern they started to make their way 
back against the current towards the shotline. The buddy 
stopped at a prominent feature to observe the overall scene. 
The diver approached his buddy and placed his hand on his 
shoulder whilst he changed regulators. The diver then pointed 
to the shotline and swam off. The buddy then found the diver on 
the shotline without his regulator and not breathing.  The buddy 
tried to get the diver's attention and get him to accept a 
regulator but despite assistance from another diver there was 
no response. By this time the buddy had 30 min of mandatory 
decompression to conduct and, as there were no signs of life, 
he sent the casualty to the surface where he was recovered 
onto the charter boat.  The Coastguard was alerted and 
resuscitation techniques were applied. The diver was airlifted to 
hospital where he later died. 
September 2012 12/162 
Two divers made their descent onto a wreck site at 36m, then 
continued around the wreck. After 14min one of the pair began 
to get too much air in his drysuit feet and rose about 5m. He 
righted himself and descended to his buddy at 30m but he 
seemed a bit panicked, signalling he wanted to go up. He had 
110 bar of air, so his buddy led him to the shotline. The troubled 
diver ascended the line hand over hand pulling himself up, 
getting faster on ascent; the buddy tried to dump air and slow it 
down. He wouldn’t make a safety stop and rapidly went to the 
surface, inflated his BCD and waved to the boat in distress. As 
the boat approached him he became unconscious so his buddy 
administered rescue breaths until he was lifted onto the boat. 
The Coastguard was alerted and resuscitation techniques were 
applied.  A medical link call was established.  The casualty did 
not respond to treatment and did not regain consciousness.  It 
is reported that this diver had finished a drysuit training course 
the day before and was diving with the course instructor.  It was 
suggested that he suffered a heart attack.

Decompression Incidents 
 
October 2011 12/004 
A diver conducted two dives in a day both to a maximum depth 
of 35m each for a total duration of 28 min with a surface interval 
between the two dives of 47 min. Following the second dive the 
diver reported to the on site dive centre complaining of pains in 
his right shoulder and 'pins and needles' in his arm and right 
wrist. The diver was given oxygen and regained normal 
sensation in his wrist after 5 min but no change in his shoulder 
pain after 25 min. The diver was given advice and fluids and the 
contact details for the local recompression chamber. 
October 2011 12/017 
A rebreather diver was preparing to enter the water with an 
open circuit diver for a planned dive to 42m for 25 min bottom 
time and a total dive time planned using the open circuit diver's 
air and nitrox 50 deco gas. The rebreather only started with one 
controller and so the dive was aborted before entering the 
water. The rebreather diver then borrowed a twin-set with two 
12 lt cylinders of nitrox 32 which were bled down and then 
topped up to produce a mix suitable for the planned depth 
(nitrox 27). The wing and harness from the rebreather were 
used to support the twin cylinders and provide buoyancy. 
During the dive the setup was not well supported and moved 
from side to side.  At the end of the dive, the diver started his 
ascent and deployed a DSMB then reached for the wing dump 
valve but could not locate it due to unfamiliarity, the dump being 
behind him.   A buoyant ascent was started but the diver was 
able to initially maintain contact with his buddy by swimming 
against the increasing buoyancy and with his buddy corrected 
his attitude in the water. On ascending to 21m the diver was 
unable to control his buoyancy any more and he made a direct 
ascent to the surface switching to nitrox 60 on the way up. On 
the surface the diver signalled the boat and continued to 
breathe from the nitrox 60 until picked up by the boat. On return 
to the boat the diver was placed on 100% oxygen, laid down 
and given fluids. The Coastguard was contacted and a link call 
made with a diving doctor who recommended recompression. A 
helicopter was tasked and airlifted the diver to a recompression 
chamber where a skin DCI was diagnosed. The diver was given 
a 6 hour treatment with complete resolution of symptoms. The 
diver was advised not to dive again for six weeks.

Brixham Coastguard tasked RN rescue helicopter R-193, to 
airlift a diver with suspected DCI sickness to DDRC in Plymouth 
for treatment. The diver was from a dive boat who noticed that 
when he surfaced he was showing signs of DCI.  Diving at 
Whitsand Bay, Plymouth. Plymouth inshore lifeboat and other 
vessels including MCA Falcon assisted from sea and Tamar 
Coastguards assisted from shore.  (Coastguard & RNLI 
reports). 
October 2011 12/238 
Shetland Coastguard was alerted by a dive vessel of a male 
diver suffering from severe abdominal pain which was believed 
to be dive related, the vessel was met by an ambulance and the 
casualty transferred to the chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard 
report). 
October 2011 12/020 
A diver prepared to dive for the first time with a new set of twin 
10 lt cylinders. He conducted a weight check beside the pier 
before getting onto the boat but neglected to take account of 
the cylinders being full. The diver was buddied with a rebreather 
diver for a dive on a wreck at a maximum depth of 29m. After 
31 min bottom time the diver had accumulated 7 min of stops 
and signalled his buddy he wanted to ascend. The buddy had 
previously said that he may split the pair as he was able to stay 
down longer with his rebreather. The open circuit diver then 
deployed his DSMB as instructed by the skipper and started his 
ascent. The diver was unable to maintain control of his 
buoyancy due to the reduced air content of his cylinders and, 
despite dumping all buoyancy and trying to swim down, 
ascended direct to the surface missing 6 min of required stops. 
The diver gave a distress signal to the boat and on being picked 
up advised them of the missed stops. The diver was advised 
that as no symptoms were evident that he should sit down and 
drink some water. The boat recovered the remaining divers and 
returned to harbour. The diver then consulted the trip organiser 
and was advised to continue to monitor for symptoms. When 
the time came to return home no symptoms were apparent and 
a check for arm strength was given but seemed fine.  The diver 
was given an oxygen cylinder and regulator for the journey 
home just in case. The driver was driven home by a friend with 
no indication of symptoms. Once at home the diver took a cool 
shower and then became dizzy, lost his balance and 
experienced a headache. He got out of the shower and decided 
to use the oxygen. The diver then attended A&E, was 
diagnosed with DCI and transferred to a recompression 
chamber for treatment.  The diver received a 6 hour treatment 
and was discharged the next day following a complete 
resolution of symptoms. 
October 2011 12/030 
A diver had conducted two training dives the previous day 
involving a number of ascents. The following day the diver, with 
an instructor and two buddies, conducted a first dive to repeat 
the controlled buoyant lift drills from the previous day. He had 
difficulty with these and made a number of unsuccessful 
attempts at ascents from 18m with a total dive duration of 14 
min. Following the dive, during the swim back to the shore, the 
diver undertook a 50m rescue tow. After the dive it was 
identified that the diver and his buddy were both carrying too 
much weight. The diver decided he would not do the next dive 
because he was exhausted and wanted a rest. After a surface 
interval of 2 hours 44 min the diver joined the group again for a 
dive to a maximum depth of 16m for 11 min. The diver was 
acting as an observer on this dive whilst others in the group 

 NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2012    
?BSAC - 2012  11 
practised ascents. During the swim back on the surface the 
diver was asked by the instructor if he wanted to drop down to 
10m to practise the ascent again because he had seemed 
annoyed he had not succeeded previously. The divers 
descended to a maximum depth of 13m for a 3 min duration 
and the ascent was conducted successfully. The diver had not 
noticed that his computer had activated an alarm due to the 
short surface interval and was locked out. Following the dive 
the group packed up and went for a debrief where the diver had 
a coffee. The diver did not feel brilliant and had an aching arm. 
The diver then went to work for a couple of hours and then 
returned home. The pain in his arm was increasing and he tried 
looking for signs of bruising but did not recollect banging the 
arm. Later in the evening the diver contacted a member of his 
club and was advised to call a diver helpline. On contacting the 
helpline the details were taken and the diver was advised to 
attend a recompression chamber where he received a 6 hours 
30 min treatment followed by a 2 hours 30 min treatment the 
following day with a significant reduction in symptoms. 
November 2011 12/247 
Brixham Coastguard was informed by Plymouth Longroom port 
control that a dive boat had requested permission to head back 
to Queen Ann Battery marina at speed with a diver with 
possible DCI. Dive boat skipper had made own arrangements to

Holyhead Coastguard was alerted to a diver who had suffered 
serious DCI following a dive in a freshwater quarry. The diver 
was unconscious, face down, for few minutes on the surface.  
The dive was for 5 min in the water to a depth of 56m. Holyhead 
Coastguard tasked rescue helicopter R-122 to fly the casualty 
direct to a recompression chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard 
report).

An instructor and 4 students were engaged in a training course 
at a maximum depth of 6m. During alternative source practice, 
the casualty accidentally knocked his own regulator out of his 
mouth and went from surprise to panic and made for the 
surface. The instructor tried without success to replace the 
casualty's regulator while slowing their ascent to the top. At the 
surface, casualty stated he was alright so the instructor left him 
with a passing instructor for a few minutes while descending 
again and taking two other students through the skill. When 
back at the surface, the instructor asked the casualty if he 
wanted to try the skill again, the casualty initially said yes then 
started having chest pain so he was taken to shore and put on 
oxygen.  The emergency services were called and, out of 
precaution, they took casualty to hospital. Further tests revealed 
possibility of an air bubble behind casualty's heart.

A diver conducted two dives a day over a weekend with dives 
on day one no deeper than 10m.  On day two she dived to 18m 
and then, after a surface interval of 2 hours 15 min, she dived to 
a maximum depth of 20m. During both dives on the second day 
the diver experienced buoyancy problems with her drysuit, 
feeling that air had become trapped.  She had difficulty 
maintaining a 6m safety stop on the first dive rising to 2m and 
then fighting to get back to 6m.  On the second dive she could 
not control the stop at all and ascended direct to the surface 
and remained there. After a surface interval of around 5 hours 
the diver began a car journey home.  An hour later she began to 
feel unwell with a headache and fatigue which both gradually 
increased until she fell asleep. On returning home the diver took 
pain relief and went to bed but had a restless night. The 
following morning the diver noticed a purple rash in clusters on 
her chest, neck and back; she still had the headache and felt 
tired and lightheaded. The diver discussed it with her husband 
but felt uncomfortable phoning a recompression chamber. The 
diver was eventually persuaded to call the chamber and after 
describing her symptoms was advised to attend straight away. 
The diver attended a recompression chamber and was 
recompressed on a royal navy table 62 with extensions and 
received a follow up treatment the next day

Diver in difficulties, A dive vessel called to advise MRCC 
Brixham that they had a diver onboard who was possibly 
suffering from a decompression problem after diving the wreck 
Abelard, at the end of Plymouth Breakwater. Diver taken to the 
DDRC for assessment  (Coastguard report). 
March 2012 12/050 
An instructor conducted two training dives involving a number of 
ascents. The first dive was to a maximum depth of 20m for a 
total dive time of 20 min and involved two ascents from 20m to 
6m and both were controlled and within the limits of dive 
computers. A 3 min safety stop was conducted at a depth of 6m 
before a controlled ascent to the surface. After a surface 
interval of 2 hours 30 min a dive was conducted to a maximum 
depth of 15m and involved two more ascents with the instructor 
was acting as a 'casualty' . The first ascent was uncontrolled 
from 10m to 3m before the ascent was halted and the pair 
descended to repeat the ascent. The second ascent was 
controlled, stopping at 6m and a 3 min safety stop was 
completed before a controlled ascent to the surface. Three days 
later the instructor noticed an unusual throbbing pain in her 
arms which came and went rather than being continuous. The 
arm also felt weak and was described as a dead weight. The 
following day she contacted a diving doctor and was advised to 
report to a recompression chamber where she received 
recompression treatment resulting in full resolution of 
symptoms. 
March 2012 12/365 
The casualty completed a deep dive in the morning, then went 
on a fun dive after a surface interval of 1 hour 46 min. The dive 
profile was 12m for 20 min, there were no issues except for a 
rapid ascent computer warning. No symptoms appeared until a 
few hours later when casualty felt numbness and weakness in 
right arm. Casualty was treated in chamber for DCI.

Clyde Coastguard received a call from ambulance control 
requesting assistance to transfer a diver suffering from DCI to 
the recompression chamber at Millport, Isle of Cumbrae. Largs 
RNLI inshore lifeboat was tasked to meet the ambulance and 
transfer the casualty to the Isle of Cumbrae.  (Coastguard

Milford Haven Coastguard was alerted by a dive support vessel 
to a 40 year old male suffering from DCI, RAF helicopter R-169 
evacuated the casualty to the hyperbaric chamber in Derriford 
on the duty diving medical officer's advice. Dale Coastguard 
rescue team provided initial first aid and prepared the landing 
site. Two other divers who had surfaced quickly but with no 
symptoms were assessed by both RAF and ambulance 
paramedics before being released.  (Coastguard report).

A diver and his buddy conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 
26m for a maximum duration of 35 min including 9 min at a 
depth of 6m checking their buoyancy and carrying out safety 
stops. Both divers were using dive computers, with the diver 
using a new computer. After returning to the RHIB with no 
problems they stowed their kit and started to have lunch. After a 
period of 10 min or so the diver complained of pain in the right 
side of his chest and of having no feeling in one of his legs. The 
diver was laid down with legs raised and given oxygen. The 
Coastguard was informed and after consultation with a diving 
doctor the RHIB was advised to return to harbour to be met by 
an ambulance. On returning to shore the diver was transferred 
by ambulance to a recompression chamber where he received 
a 5 hour treatment. The diver was reported to have suffered 
DCI due to dehydration.

Clyde Coastguard received a call from a dive vessel advising 
that a female diver aboard was suffering from DCI following a 
dive on the Tapti off Coll. Rescue helicopter 177 airlifted her 
from the vessel to Lorne and the Isles hospital in Oban where 
she was kept for observation. Oban Coastguard rescue team 
manned the landing site.  (Coastguard report). 
April 2012 12/064 
An instructor and student were diving on a wreck at a maximum 
depth of 18m. A gas check around 20 min into the dive 
indicated that the instructor had 135 bar and the student had 
110 bar remaining. Around 22 min, after some previous 
buoyancy issues, and at a depth of 13m the student's 
weightbelt came undone and fell off. The student and instructor 
managed to swim down and grab the belt. The student held 
onto a rock whilst the instructor struggled to refit the belt for 
approximately 6 min. After successfully refitting the belt the 
instructor checked the student's gas and found he had only 10 
bar remaining and so she gave him her alternate source.  They 
started to ascend after 28 min. The instructor had 30 bar 
remaining. During the ascent the student became inverted and 
the pair made an uncontrolled ascent to the surface. The 
instructor ensured both their BCDs were fully inflated on the 
surface and signalled distress to the cover RHIB.  The boat 
came alongside and requested the divers swim around and 
away from the rocks to allow the boat access. On recovery into 
the boat the student was placed on oxygen and then the 
instructor was recovered and both divers shared the oxygen 
supply. Whilst the second diver was being recovered a lone 
diver surfaced and signalled distress (Incident no. 12/063) and 
was subsequently recovered; that she had also had a fast 
ascent. The oxygen equipment was then shared between the 
three divers who were breathing from it for one minute each 
whilst waiting for the remaining divers to surface. As the oxygen 
began to run low the skipper contacted a charter boat in the 
area which provided an additional oxygen set which the three 
divers then shared between them. Attempts to contact the shore 
by VHF radio were unsuccessful and so the boat returned to 
shore after recovering the remaining divers. On approaching the 
shore the boat signalled distress to the shore party and by the 
time the boat arrived several additional oxygen sets were 
available. All divers were placed on oxygen and the Coastguard 
was alerted. The Coastguard tasked a rescue helicopter, which 
was being refuelled at the time.  The three were monitored and 
given fluids and none displayed any symptoms of DCI.  At the 
recompression chamber the student and the diver from the 
second incident were assessed and found not to require 
recompression treatment. The instructor started to display 
symptoms of visual disturbances, memory loss, aches in 
various joints and felt generally exhausted. She received two 
recompression treatments over the next two days, appearing to 
make a full recovery and was released. After several days the 
instructor complained of slight memory loss and occasional 
trouble finding words when speaking and joint weakness. The 
instructor represented to the chamber and was given two further 
treatments over two days before being discharged again. Some 
speech and memory symptoms persisted. 
April 2012 12/061 
A diver conducted a drift dive to a maximum depth of 21m for a 
bottom time of 42 min. On leaving the bottom the diver had 9 
min bottom time remaining on his computer. The diver made a 
controlled ascent to a depth of 10m where he lost control of his 
buoyancy and made a fast ascent to the surface. His buddy 
asked if he was alright and he responded "not sure" and said he 
felt disorientated. On exiting the water and boarding the charter 
boat his condition deteriorated and he felt unsteady and sick. 
The diver started to vomit and was offered anti-seasickness 
medication by others on the boat but he declined. Whilst this 
was happening the boat skipper pulled into a sheltered cove for 
the surface interval.  Meanwhile the diver's condition 
deteriorated further. The diver was still dressed in his drysuit 
and so was assisted to remove it by others and he went to lie 
down in a bunk whilst the dive boat moved to the second dive 
site. Another diver reported his condition to the skipper and said 
he would not do the second dive in order to look after him. At 
that point the diver was placed on oxygen. Shortly after all dives 
were completed and the boat returned to shore. On returning to 
shore the skipper contacted the Coastguard. The Coastguard 
contacted the duty diving doctor and the diver was referred to a 
recompression chamber for treatment of a vestibular DCI. 
(Coastguard report only) 
April 2012 12/065 
A diver was on a training trip as part of a group. Prior to the trip 
she had experienced a short lived cold/flu following a flight from 
New Zealand to the UK. The diver was still feeling run down as 
a result, had limited her diving in the preceding days and had 
not dived at all the day before the incident.  On the day of the 
incident the diver conducted three shore dives. On all dives 
during the trip the diver was wearing a neoprene drysuit that 
she was using for the first time, she was also wearing a 100gsm 
undersuit because she felt the cold. As a result the diver 
required 16 kg of weight which she distributed with 4 kg in the 
BCD pockets and the remainder on a weightbelt with traditional 
airline-style release buckle. The first dive was to a maximum 
depth of 12m for a total duration of 40 min including a 3 min 
safety stop at 5m. During this dive the diver experienced some 
problems with her BCD and the dive was aborted but safety 
stops were still completed. Following a surface interval of 2 
hours 15 min the diver conducted a training dive where 
controlled buoyant lift and other rescue skills were practiced. 
The dive was to a maximum depth of 6m but involved 4 or 5 
ascents and an approximate duration of 30 min. The dive 

 NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2012    
?BSAC - 2012  13 
culminated in a full controlled buoyant lift ascent followed by a 
surface tow and recovery onto shore with simulated CPR; this 
required a lot of effort. Following a surface interval of 3 hours 
and 30 min the diver entered the water for a non-training 
recreational dive with a recently qualified diver; this dive was 
planned for a maximum depth of 10m and a duration of 30 min. 
The pair descended to a maximum depth of 11m and then 
made their way slowly back to shallower depths. The diver had 
a couple of buoyancy problems but managed to rectify them 
and continue the dive. After approximately 25 min, while at a 
depth of 7m, the diver's weightbelt came undone and fell off. 
The diver managed to catch the weightbelt by the buckle, 
however, despite being advised to the previous day, she had 
not fitted a weight retainer and so three of the six 2 kg weights 
slipped off the belt. The diver then made a fast ascent to the 
surface. Her buddy had been looking in the opposite direction at 
the time and had not noticed and, on finding the diver missing, 
made a normal ascent to look for her. The pair were reunited on 
the surface and swam to shore where they alerted the shore 
cover to the fast ascent. The diver initially showed no symptoms 
of DCI, however, after an hour on the surface, the diver 
reported feeling generally unwell and was monitored closely. 
Later that evening the diver complained of nausea and started 
to vomit intermittently. The diver was assessed by two people 
but no symptoms other than nausea could be identified, 
although one thought they may have detected a slight 
weakness in one arm. A recompression chamber was 
contacted and they advised the divers to continue to monitor 
overnight and contact again in the morning. The diver continued 
to feel nauseous and vomited approximately every hour with no 
change in symptoms. On contacting the chamber again they 
advised that a neurological examination should be made at the 
local hospital. The examination was inconclusive and the diver 
was advised to transfer to the recompression chamber for 
further assessment. At the chamber the diver was diagnosed 
with a vestibular (inner ear) DCI and was given three 
recompression treatments over the next three days. After 
treatment the diver continued to experience slight bouts of 
nausea gradually receding in intensity and duration. 
Subsequent investigation by an ENT specialist identified some 
ear damage but no effect on hearing. The diver has planned 
further investigation for a PFO. 
April 2012 12/057 
A diver aborted his first dive of the day to a maximum depth of 
5m after 90 secs due to poor visibility. After a surface interval of 
3 hours the diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 19m 
for a total duration of 25 min including a 3 min safety stop at 
6m. Later that evening the diver contacted his diving officer to 
report that he had rashes on his body, 'pins and needles' in his 
legs and arms and a very bad headache. The diver was advised 
to phone the emergency services to alert them of his condition 
and of the potential implications of a PFO. The diver was placed 
on oxygen in the ambulance and contact with the duty naval 
medical officer was made. The diver was taken to a 
recompression chamber for treatment. 
April 2012 12/066 
A group of three divers were on the fifth day of a week long 
training trip. The previous day two of the divers had conducted 
dives of 9m for 30 min and 13m for 33 min whilst the third diver 
had completed dives of 9m for 19 min and 9m for 32 min. 
Adverse weather conditions had caused the group to move to a 
coastal quarry dive site to give experience of wall diving. 
Access to the site involved a steep and long walk from the car 
park and equipment was transferred in two to three trips. Entry 
to the water involved a scramble over rocks. One diver entered 
the water by climbing over rocks and she fitted her equipment in 
the water. A second diver entered the water in his equipment 
but fitted his weights once in the water and the instructor 
entered the water in full kit. The group then conducted a buddy 
check and swam to their descent point on the surface. The 
group reached a maximum depth of 16m and maintained a 
planned depth of 12-15m. After 20 min the group had reached 
an area where the wall had been knocked through to the sea 
and they were at a depth of 13m. One of the divers lost control 
of her buoyancy at this point and headed upwards. The other 
two followed her and control was re-established at around 9m at 
which point visual contact with the wall had been lost. The 
instructor then took control and started to head east towards the 
exit point.  He then realised this would take them over the 
deepest point of the site and so he turned to face the other two 
and signalled them to stop.  He intended to deploy his DSMB 
from mid-water to provide a fixed reference for the group. 
Before he could remove his DSMB from his pocket the first 
diver again had a problem with her buoyancy and headed 
upwards. The instructor was unable to keep both divers in view 
and so opted to stay with the second diver. The first diver 
gained control of her buoyancy and started to look for the other 
two including descending again to a depth of 11m and then 
ascending to the surface without conducting a safety stop. The 
other pair stayed together and the instructor deployed his 
DSMB; during the deployment their depth varied between 6m 
and 9m. The pair then made a faster than normal ascent fearing 
that the first diver had made an uncontrolled ascent and may 
require assistance on the surface. As the pair approached a 
depth of 2m the first diver could see them from the surface and 
signalled that she was OK and the pair continued direct to the 
surface. The first diver had a total dive time of 25 min and the 
other pair had completed 28 min. The three then swam back to 
the exit point on the surface. Out of concern that she may have 
had a fast ascent, the first diver was checked out, after getting 
changed out of her wetsuit; she was very cold but she reported 
feeling absolutely fine. Other divers in the group subsequently 
planned to enter the water for a second dive. However, as they 
prepared to kit up, the instructor reported he was feeling some 
abnormal muscle aches and requested they didn't go in 
immediately whilst he saw how the aches developed. After 
approximately 10 min he said they could go in, however, before 
they descended, he changed his mind and asked them to return 
to shore. The instructor then went onto oxygen and the RN 
advice line was contacted, which required going part way back 
to the car park to obtain a mobile phone signal. The instructor 
carried the oxygen cylinder in one hand and the mobile phone 
in the other whilst talking to the doctor as he was walking back 
to the car park. The diver was advised to attend A&E for further 
checks to rule out other causes for the aches. The doctor then 
called back and advised all three divers to go to hospital. Other 
divers in the group recovered the equipment to the cars and the 
group departed the site approximately 1 hour after the instructor 
went onto oxygen. The oxygen ran out just before arrival at 
hospital 45 min later. At A&E all three divers were put on 
oxygen and were transferred to the nearest recompression 
chamber by helicopter. After assessment the instructor and the 
second diver were recompressed. The two divers were released 
from hospital the following day but the instructor received three 
further 2 hour treatments before being discharged home with 
the ache in his arm still persisting, although it had alleviated 
temporarily when in the chamber. The conclusion was that the 
ache was probably not due to DCI and may have bean 
aggravated by carrying equipment including the oxygen 
cylinder.

A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 27m for a total 
duration of 43 min. On returning to the dive RHIB the diver 
began to exhibit signs of DCI and the Coastguard was 
contacted. The Coastguard tasked a rescue helicopter and the 
diver was subsequently airlifted to a recompression chamber 
where he received treatment. (Coastguard report).

Solent Coastguard received a VHF radio call from a dive boat 
requesting the evacuation of a diver with suspected DCI after 
missing 15 min of stops and complaining of a pain in his right 
shoulder. The skipper was immediately put in a medi-link call 
with the duty dive doctor, who recommended that the diver be 
airlifted to the nearest recompression facility. This was due to 
the nature of the diver's symptoms and the vessel being 20 
miles from the nearest harbour at Poole and waiting to recover 
further divers.  Maximum depth of dive 50m with bottom time of 
25 min. Casualty wearing a rebreather and separated from his 
buddy at 24m. Buddy then sighted the casualty at 9m when he 
appeared to be unable to control his buoyancy and missed a 
planned stop at 6m. The buddy surfaced normally. The 
casualty's computer stated 15 min of missed stops. Shortly after 
surfacing he complained of pain in his right shoulder for which 
he was given oxygen.  Location of incident: 18 nautical miles 
SSE of Durlston Head.  (Coastguard report).

Portland Coastguard tasked Coastguard rescue helicopter R-
106 to Dale Pembrokeshire to evacuate a diver showing 
symptoms of DCI. The 19 year old lady was flown to Poole 
where the landing site was manned by Poole coast rescue 
officers before being transferred to the recompression chamber 
by ambulance.  (Coastguard report). 
April 2012 12/229 
An instructor attended a club warm-up weekend. She carried 
out two shallow training dives on the first day of 4m for 24 min 
and 2 hours 30 min later to 3m for 18 min although more time 
was spent in the water doing weight checks and buoyancy 
adjustment than the total dive times. At the end of the first dive 
her student lost a fin and the instructor submerged briefly to 
recover it. On the next day the instructor was preparing to dive 
from a charter boat when her buddy's inflator hose failed and he 
decided not to dive and so the instructor joined another pair. 
Prior to the dive the instructor bent down to get her weightbelt 
when the boat moved in the swell and she hit her head on the 
bench. Although a little painful, the diver experienced no loss of 
consciousness or disorientation and continued to kit up. The 
instructor and her two buddies conducted an uneventful dive to 
13m for a total of 30 min including a 3 min safety stop, although 
the diver did feel colder than the previous day. Following the 
dive the instructor decided not to do a further dive as she felt 
tired and wished to return home sooner. On returning home she 
felt exhausted and had to go to sleep immediately on getting 
home and slept for at least 1 hour. Over subsequent days the 
instructor felt increasingly worse with symptoms of 
disorientation, lack of concentration and blurred vision but put 
this down to the effects of concussion. She then started to feel 
facial numbness, predominantly on the right side of her face 
and tingling on her cheeks and lip. She attended her GP who 
suggested mild concussion and mask squeeze, although the 
diver discounted mask squeeze as there was no bruising and 
she hadn't felt any squeeze whilst diving. She also reported that 
she had experienced similar symptoms previously following 
diving and flying, which had resolved within a day or two. The 
following day there was no improvement and she attended a 
recompression chamber where she was assessed by a diving 
doctor and was diagnosed with static neurological DCI. As this 
was now three weeks after the onset of symptoms there was 
concern about the effectiveness of treatment but the diver was 
given recompression treatment for 4 hours 45 min with some 
resolution of symptoms. Three further treatments achieved 
some further small improvements. During treatment the 
instructor noticed her ears were sore and felt 'fluid' running 
down inside her right ear and was advised to consult an ENT 
specialist and have other tests. ENT tests showed no problems 
with ear clearing or hearing and she advised to make contact 
again should there be a reoccurrence. A subsequent dive 
resulted in facial numbness symptoms again and further tests 
have been inconclusive as to cause.

A diver conducted a series of dives over two days using air.  
Day 1; 18m for 45 min then 22m for 37 min after a 3 hour 49 
min surface interval, then 9m for 31 min after a surface interval 
of 8 hours 18 min.  Day 2; 31m for 28 min then 8m for 37 min 
after a 7 hour 59 min surface interval.  Appropriate stops were 
made on all dives.   During the last dive the diver felt tired and 
momentarily dizzy.  After the last dive, back on shore, he again 
felt dizzy; his peripheral vision became blurred and he 
developed a pain behind his eyes.  The diver had suffered 
migraine in the past (last attack two years earlier) and he 
thought that this was the cause.  He consulted a doctor and 
took Ibuprofen.  The following day he had reduced pain.  He 
took more Ibuprofen, the pain was resolved but he did not feel 
fully fit.  Later the following day the pain returned and the 
following day he attended a recompression facility.  He received 
two sessions of recompression treatment.  The diver's buddy 
suffered no ill effects.  It remained unclear if this was DCI or 
not. 
April 2012 12/270 
Clyde Coastguard was informed of a diver feeling unwell 
following a dive to 30m. The dive boat was met by an 
ambulance for onward transportation to a recompression 
chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
April 2012 12/073 
A student arrived at an inland dive site early in the morning. The 
weather was cold and it was raining on arrival and persisted 
throughout the day. The student waited almost 4 hours, 
standing in the rain, before entering the water. By this time the 
diver had become very cold. An assistant instructor 
demonstrated a stride entry. The student was seen to become 
distressed and she started to cry.  But, on being asked by the 
supervising instructor, agreed she was well enough to continue. 
On entering the water, in a borrowed wetsuit, the diver felt 
shocked by the cold but confirmed again she wanted to 
continue and the groups descended and proceeded with the 
planned training exercises including a controlled buoyant lift 
and mask clearing. After the exercises, which had included one 
ascent to the surface, the lead instructor checked that the 
student group was comfortable.  They all said that they were 
getting cold but agree that they should continue with a swim to 
explore the quarry. The student reported that everything 
seemed normal even though it was exceptionally cold as she 
swam around. After a dive time of 23 min the student suddenly 
spotted what appeared to be her instructor sinking below her 
into the depths; she felt confused and worried but then suddenly 
arrived on the surface and realised that she had been 
ascending rather than the instructor descending. On surfacing 
the student felt shaken, dizzy and nauseous. She made her way 
back to shore and tried to exit the water but could not raise her 
foot onto the step. She told the instructors on the shore that she 
needed a minute or two to catch her breath and was 
subsequently able to get a grip on the steps and pull herself up. 
On getting out of the water the student removed her equipment 
and felt an urgent need to relieve herself. She made her way to 
the toilets and experienced a very painful bladder. In the toilet 

 NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2012    
?BSAC - 2012  15 
she was unable to remove her wetsuit as she did not have the 
strength and she asked another person to help her remove it. 
Despite the pain she was initially unable to pass urine;  a while 
later she was able to but with some pain. The student then 
rushed to the changing room to put on warm clothes as she was 
shaking with the cold. She experienced aches in her muscles 
and joints and her head was spinning. On returning to the group 
the student explained her symptoms and was advised to have a 
warm drink. The student became increasingly panicked, 
agitated and angry with people who tried to talk to her, which 
was uncharacteristic. She subsequently went to get a hot coffee 
but felt nauseous and went to be sick, vomiting for around 5 
min. On returning to the group she was again checked and 
advised to take warm drinks. The student slowly improved and 
by the time the group left for home she had a headache and 
was still dizzy but the nausea and shakes had ceased. On the 
drive home the student told her driver how she was feeling and 
was advised to take a warm bath on returning home. On 
returning to the club equipment store the student carried her 
cylinder and equipment back into the basement whilst 
struggling to stand upright. Her head was spinning again and 
her eyes ached. She described her symptoms to an 
experienced diver in the group and was reassured that it was 
the effects of the cold and he was sure she would be alright and 
she went home.  At home she took a hot bath and had some 
hot food and no longer felt nauseous but the dizziness was 
worsening especially after the bath. She went to bed and fell 
straight asleep but woke several times during the night with 
pounding headaches. The next morning she contacted a diving 
helpline and, after describing her symptoms, was advised to 
attend a hyperbaric unit for assessment. At the recompression 
chamber the student was assessed and found to have 
problems with the nerves of her left hand and right leg. She 
received a 4 hour 45 min recompression treatment after which 
her symptoms improved considerably. The diver received four 
further treatments of 1 hour 40 min over the next four days.  A 
computer dive profile provided indicates that the diver dived to 
4m for about 3 min and then surfaced.  1 min later the diver 
dived to 4m for about 14 min and then surfaced.  5 min later to 
a maximum depth of 14m with a rapid ascent back to the 
surface after a duration of 9 min.

A diver was airlifted by helicopter from a charter boat after 
suffering from symptoms of DCI following a dive to 60m. After 
airlifting the diver the helicopter suffered mechanical problems 
and landed at its base. A second helicopter was tasked and the 
helicopter transferred the diver to a recompression chamber 
where he received treatment.

Solent Coastguard coordinated the recovery of a diver from the 
Isle of Wight by Coastguard rescue helicopter R-104 to a 
recompression facility at Chichester for treatment, the diver had 
felt unwell at home following a dive to 35m and self admitted to 
A&E on the Island.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2012 12/091 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 27m.  With 
3 min of no stop time remaining one of the divers started to 
deploy a DSMB but the line became tangled on the reel.  The 
other diver then deployed his DSMB.  He set the reel to allow 
the line to run freely but then dropped the reel, which fell into 
the wreck.  The diver pulled on the reel to recover it and wound 
up the line as they ascended.  The delays caused them to 
require decompression stops.  The diver who had dropped the 
reel was a little light on the ascent so the other diver gave him 1 
kg of lead at 18m.  Both divers began to experience problems 
with buoyancy control and they were carried directly to the 
surface missing 6 min of stops.  Once out of the water they 
were placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  The 
divers were airlifted to a recompression facility where one was 
given recompression treatment because she exhibited an 
abnormal reaction to nerve stimulation. 
June 2012 12/105 
A pair of divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 
40m using air.  They made a controlled ascent with the 
following stops: 1 min at 22m, 1 min at 18m, 1 min at 15m, 1 
min at 12m, 1 min at 9m, 4 min at 6m and 1 min at 4m.  One of 
the pair switched to nitrox 36 for the 9m and 6m stops and then 
back to air before finally surfacing.  10 min later the diver who 
had used nitrox experienced a pain to his right side, under his 
rib cage.  At first he thought this was a muscular strain but it 
persisted and he began to feel light-headed.  He was offered 
oxygen but as the shore was close they continued back to land.  
He was assisted ashore, placed on oxygen and the Coastguard 
was alerted.  An ambulance crew attended and the diver was 
airlifted to a recompression facility.  He was diagnosed with a 
vestibular DCI and received a series of treatments over the 
following days. His condition continued to improve. 
June 2012 12/093 
A diver conducted a series of dives over a three day period.  On 
day two she dived to 17m for 38 min.  2 hours later she dived to 
23m for 38 min.  On the third day, after a 20 hour surface 
interval, she dived to 30m using nitrox 32.  During this dive her 
minimum remaining no stop time was 2 min.  She arrived back 
at 6m, with her buddy, after a dive duration of 36 min.  They 
conducted a 5 min safety stop and then surfaced.  At the 
surface they had to wait for about 10 min to be picked up 
because their boat was busy with other divers. Once back in the 
boat she got cramp in her leg whilst removing her drysuit.  
Some time later the diver developed short-term memory loss.

She was placed on oxygen, the Coastguard was alerted and the 
diver was airlifted to a recompression facility for treatment.  
There was a suggestion that the diver may have suffered a mild 
stroke. 
June 2012 12/094 
A group of five divers undertook a 'dry dive' in a recompression 
chamber.  They were taken to a simulated depth of 41m.  
Problems with ear clearing resulted in less time than planned at 
this depth.  During the decompression phase, they breathed 
100% oxygen for 9 min at 9m.  Their total dive duration was 31 
min.  After the dive one of the party experienced a dull ache in 
his elbow but did not think it was related to the dive.  The 
following morning he had a swelling in his neck and felt unwell.  
He contacted the hyperbaric facility and went to them for 
examination.  He was diagnosed with a possible skin DCI and 
given recompression treatment.  During an air break he began 
to fit.  He was stabilized and returned to surface pressure.  He 
was referred for a PFO test which proved positive.  He was 
advised not to dive again. 
June 2012 12/287 
A 'Pan Pan' alert was received from a dive support vessel 
reporting they had a diver who had surfaced with symptoms of 
DCI, a medi-link call with the dive doctor was carried out and 
evacuation was recommended to a hyperbaric chamber. R-131 
was tasked and because of the poor visibility at Hull the pilot 
decided he would be going to Aberdeen. The casualty refused 
any medical assistance or evacuation despite recommendation 
from the vessel skipper, dive doctor and the helicopter 
paramedic.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2012 12/171 
The day after a dive using nitrox 32 without incident to a 
maximum depth of 30m for a total duration of 40 min including 
stops of 1 min at 13m and 3 min at 5m a diver reported feeling 
unwell and had a headache. The diver rang a diving doctor and 
she was advised to have recompression treatment as a 
precaution. The diver was recompressed for a total of 4 hours 
45 min with relief of all symptoms. 
June 2012 12/181 
Two divers were airlifted by helicopter to a recompression 
chamber following a dive in a disused quarry. (Media report 
only). 
June 2012 12/104 
A pair of divers descended a reef to a depth of 35m.  One of the 
pair was wearing a new drysuit.  He familiarised himself with the 
drysuit controls during the descent and put air into his BCD 
once on the seabed.  This diver was breathing air from a 12 lt 
cylinder and carried a 3 lt pony cylinder.  After 25 min he 
signalled that he had 100 bar and, at a depth of 33m, they 
agreed to terminate the dive.  Both divers deployed DSMBs and 
began their ascent.  At this point the diver with the new drysuit 
had 12 min of stops indicated and 80 bar in his cylinder.  He 
was a little buoyant and ascended quickly to 15m where he was 
able to regain control and his buddy caught up with him.  At 6m 
his computer indicated 9 min of stops.  He experienced difficulty 
controlling his buoyancy and his depth fluctuated between 4m 
and 8m.  He became tangled in his DSMB line and his 
breathing rate increased as he and his buddy tried to free him.  
He grew agitated and was breathing heavily.  With 6 min of 
decompression remaining his main cylinder was down to 20 
bar; he changed to his pony cylinder.  He started to float to the 
surface but managed to get back down to 6m.  His pony 
cylinder was quickly consumed and he indicated to his buddy 
that he would need his buddy's alternative source.  The buddy 
was using nitrox 28 and had completed his stops, but he only 
had 40 bar remaining and the troubled diver still had 3 min of 
mandatory stops remaining.  The buddy realised that they did 
not have enough gas and, not wanting to run out completely, 
indicated that they should surface.  They made a slow 
controlled ascent to the surface.  Once back in the boat the 
diver was placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  
After abut 15 min the diver developed a pain in his right elbow 
and right knee joints.  Both divers were taken by lifeboat and 
ambulance to a recompression facility where the subject diver 
received recompression treatment. 
June 2012 12/127 
A diver was on his seventh dive of a week's diving.  His 
previous two dives, the day before, were 14m for 33 min and 
then 5m for 15 min with a surface interval of 3 hours 8 min.  The 
plan for the seventh dive was 20m for 30 min; the actual dive 
was 25m for 24 min.  All dives were conducted using BSAC88 
tables.  After the dive, the diver felt cold and developed a 
headache.  Later he declined a second dive and mentioned his 
headache.  The diver was a little unresponsive and unsteady so 
he was placed on oxygen and taken to a medical facility.  Diving 
medical advice was sought and the diver was airlifted to a 
recompression facility where he received two sessions of 
recompression therapy.  He made a full recovery. 
June 2012 12/232 
Two divers made a rapid ascent and on surfacing made an 
emergency signal to their charter boat. The charter boat 
recovered the divers and placed both on oxygen and then made 
an emergency call for assistance to the Coastguard. The call 
was heard by divers in a RHIB nearby which had divers in the 
water and had witnessed the original distress signal. One of the 
crew onboard was a diving doctor and she offered her 
professional skills which were gratefully accepted and so she 
swam over the charter boat leaving her coxswain to recover 
their remaining divers. The doctor checked the two divers and 
found that one was very unwell whilst the other complained of 
severe leg/calf pain. The doctor provided medical care whilst 
the charter boat returned to harbour, leaving a last remaining 
pair to be recovered by the RHIB. The RHIB recovered its own 
divers and when the charter boat divers surfaced they 
recovered them as well, although initially the divers swam away 
from the RHIB until the situation was explained. At the harbour 
the ill divers were airlifted by helicopter tasked by the 
Coastguard and transferred to a recompression chamber for 
treatment. One of the divers required extensive recompression 
treatment for neurological DCI. 
June 2012 12/358 
A diver suffering from DCI was airlifted to a hyperbaric facility 
for treatment.  (Media report only). 
June 2012 12/176 
A diver conducted two dives during a day acting as an assistant 
to an instructor conducting training.  The first dive was to a 
maximum depth of 8m and 29 min duration and, after a surface 
interval of 22 min, the second to a maximum of 11m and 40 min 
duration. The diver used nitrox 26 for both dives and his dive 
computer was set for air. Early during the second dive the diver 
made an ascent from around 2m to the surface whilst staying 
close to one of the students. After the student had stabilised the 
dive proceeded under control to an area close to the first dive 
where a search was conducted for cue cards lost during the first 
dive. Although the diver had felt he was physically exerted the 
search continued to a maximum depth of 11m without finding 
the missing cards and the diver and his buddy made a slow 
ascent following the quarry bed back to the entry point and they 
conducted a safety stop at 5m for 3 min.  After surfacing and a 
debrief the group left the site to return home. During the drive 

 NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2012    
?BSAC - 2012  17 
home the diver began to experience stiff joints and aches in his 
upper body and the symptoms became progressively worse 
during the drive home. Once at home the diver contacted a 
recompression chamber and he was advised to attend for 
assessment as a precaution.  Following examination the diver 
was diagnosed as suffering from DCI and was recompressed.

The Yorkshire air ambulance transferred a male suffering a 
diving sickness related illness to the Hull hyperbaric unit after 
being landed by a dive boat. Units and resources had been 
tasked without MRCC Humber involvement.  (Coastguard 
report). 
July 2012 12/206 
Two divers were paired with two experienced divers for a depth 
progression dive to a maximum depth of 35m. Towards the end 
of the dive, the dive leader realised that the group had overrun 
their time due to poor visibility and had started to go into 
required decompression stops. One of the divers was identified 
as not having sufficient gas to allow the planned return along 
the shore to their start point. The dive leader deployed a DSMB 
to enable a controlled ascent. The diver who had insufficient 
gas now indicated he was getting low and his buddy offered him 
his alternate source; this was declined and the diver started to 
ascend the DSMB line. At a depth of 22m the diver's contents 
was down to 30 bar and the diver panicked and started to 
ascend too quickly and lost sight of his buddy. The diver 
surfaced without completing any stops and made his way to 
shore. When the other three divers surfaced the diver was 
already being attended to by the on site staff and was being 
given oxygen. The diver attended a recompression chamber the 
following day and received a precautionary recompression 
treatment. The diver has since had a check up and been 
cleared to dive. 
July 2012 12/143 
A pair of divers conducted a 42 min dive to 21m with a 3 min 
stop at 6m.  2 hours later they dived to 21m for 36 min with a 3 
min stop at 6m.  Once out of the water one of the pair 
developed an abnormal feeling in his legs, 'pins and needles' 
and a pain in his stomach.  He felt very unsteady.  This diver 
suffered from arthritis in his right hip joint but had never had 
'pins and needles' before.  He was placed on oxygen and diving 
medical advice was sought.  The 'pins and needles' subsided.  
The diver was taken to a recompression facility for assessment.

helicopter landing site.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2012 12/227 
A diver and his buddy completed a dive without incident to a 
maximum depth of 25m and a total duration of 46 min with a 1 
min stop at 6m. Approximately 4 hours after the dive the diver 
went to work and then started to experience a slight pain in his 
knees and a tingling sensation around his face. The diver 
contacted his buddy for advice regarding the symptoms and 
was advised to call a duty doctor at a recompression chamber 
who suggested that he attend for further examination. The 
examination was inconclusive but the diver was advised to 
undergo a precautionary recompression treatment for 4 hours. 
The diver had this recompression treatment and was 
discharged home the following day. His buddy did not 
experience any symptoms. The diver had suffered a serious 
head injury some months previously that had resulted in being 
unconscious for approximately 4 hours but had been advised at 
A&E that it should not prevent him diving. The diver has sought 
further medical advice and been advised not to dive for nine 
months.

chamber and was kept in overnight.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2012 12/135 
Two divers conducted a dive to a wreck at a maximum depth of 
42m using nitrox 28.  During the dive, one of the pair became 
uneasy and they ascended the shotline early.  At 12m they 
switched to their decompression gases; one using nitrox 50 and 
the other nitrox 72.  The diver on nitrox 72 was about 2m above 
his buddy when he became aware of an abnormal amount of 
bubbles coming from his buddy.  He was preparing to switch 
back to his dive gas to go to the buddy's assistance when the 
buddy rushed past him, pulling himself up the shotline.  The 
buddy went directly to the surface while the diver on nitrox 72 
completed his 5 min stop.  The troubled diver was recovered 
into the boat and placed on oxygen.  He said that he felt unwell 
and complained of stomach pain.  The Coastguard was alerted 
and a lifeboat launched to assist. The troubled diver was taken 
by lifeboat, ambulance and helicopter to a recompression 
facility where he was treated for DCI.

Following an air dive to a maximum depth of 30m, two divers 
ascended to 15m where a 1 min stop was planned.  At this point 
one of the pair lost control of his buoyancy and despite he and 
his buddy attempting to dump air from his drysuit and his BCD, 
they were both carried to the surface.  Their dive duration was 
24 min and they missed 3 min of stops at 6m.  Both divers were 
placed on oxygen.  The buoyant diver then developed 'pins and 
needles' in his left hand and the Coastguard was alerted.  The 
other diver had no symptoms and switched to nitrox 50.  They 
were taken by ambulance and helicopter to a recompression 
facility where they both received treatment and were then 
discharged later that day. 
August 2012 12/311 
Following a 21m dive with duration of 42 min the diver did not 
go into deco during the dive and completed a 3 min 6m stop, as 
a precaution, diving on air.  The dive seemed to go to plan only, 
once on deck, approx 15min later, the diver started getting 
symptoms. The casualty was transferred to St Richards’s 
hospital Chichester by Coastguard rescue helicopter R-106.  
(Coastguard report). 
August 2012 12/146 
Two divers were at a depth of 18m when one of the pair 
panicked and rushed for the surface.  His buddy attempted to 
slow the ascent.  The panicked diver spat out his regulator at 
16m.  The buddy replaced and purged the regulator.  On 
surfacing the alarm was raised and a number of divers at the 
site responded and recovered the diver from the water. On 
examination the diver was found to have no signs of breathing 
and his airway was obstructed with water and frothy mucus. The 
diver was recovered from the water and turned on his side to 
drain the fluid.  He was found to be unresponsive to voice and 
pain but had a strong carotid pulse. Following further efforts to 
clear the airway the diver started breathing again and as the 
onsite rescue team arrived the diver was placed on oxygen.  He 
was unresponsive for about 6 min.  He was breathing and had a 
strong pulse but he was very grey.  He slowly recovered after 
20 min on oxygen.  An air ambulance attended and the diver 
was taken by ambulance to hospital.  He received hyperbaric 
treatment the following day. 
August 2012 12/224 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 37m for a total 
duration of 36 min including stops at 6m for 6 min, using nitrox 
26 for the dive and nitrox 29 for the stops. Approximately 45 
min after surfacing the diver noticed an itching sensation across 
the top of his back and a red rash extending down his right arm. 
Suspecting a skin DCI the diver started breathing oxygen whilst 
lying down and taking fluids. After approximately 40 min on 
oxygen the rash cleared noticeably and no other symptoms 
became apparent. An ambulance attended the scene 
approximately 1 hour after starting oxygen but the crew were 
unfamiliar with DCI and conducted basic checks and gave the 
all clear. 
August 2012 12/149 
Two divers were at a depth of 25m when one of them became 
low on air and panicked.  His buddy offered his octopus 
regulator.  They made a rapid ascent to the surface.   Their dive 
duration was 25 min.  Once back in the boat the divers 
exhibited symptoms of DCI and the Coastguard was alerted.  
The divers were airlifted to a recompression facility for 
treatment. 
August 2012 12/195 
A diver was pulled rapidly to the surface when his SMB line was 
snagged by a boat. The diver was recovered by his dive boat 
and then transferred to a lifeboat which had been launched.  He 
was taken back to shore where he was transferred by 
ambulance to a recompression chamber. (Media report only). 
August 2012 12/160 
A diver conducted a series of four no stop dives over a two day 
period.  On the first day his dives were: 25m for 41 min and 
21m for 42 min with a 1 hour 53 min surface interval.  On the 
second day his dives were 23m for 42 min and 24m for 37 min 
after a 2 hour surface interval.  He was diving with air.  On the 
third dive an issue with his buddy's buoyancy caused him to 
miss a safety stop.  Once back in the boat the diver noticed a 
pain in his right bicep.  Initially he thought that this was due to a 
muscle strain which occurred whilst using the diver lift.  Some 
hours later the pain moved to the diver's shoulder.  He was 
placed on oxygen, diving medical advice was sought and he 
attended a hospital.  Various tests were conducted and advice 
was given for the diver to attend a recompression chamber.  On 
the way the pain in his bicep became intense.  He was given 
recompression treatment and this dramatically reduced the 
pain.  After the treatment the pain had gone.  He subsequently 
experienced 'pins and needles' across his chest but this 
condition resolved after a few days. 
August 2012 12/196 
Holyhead Coastguard received a call requesting assistance for 
a diver with suspected DCI at Dorothea quarry.  His dive buddy 
had become nauseous and started to vomit approximately 1.5 
hours after they had surfaced from a 61m dive.  North Wales 
police were alerted to the incident by MRCC Holyhead as this 
location is classed as inland water; it was agreed that MRCC 
Holyhead would co-ordinate this incident for the rescue of the 
diver. North Wales ambulance service was contacted for the 
request of the air ambulance but this unit was tasked to a 
separate incident and was not able to assist. ARCC were 
contacted to request the use of rescue helicopter R-122 from 
RAF Valley, this was tasked with immediate effect with an ETA 
on scene of 10 min.  Llandwrog Coastguard rescue team were 
tasked to assist with on scene communications at the quarry 
and to monitor the helicopter landing site. The casualty was 
assessed on scene by the helicopter crew and airlifted to 
Murrayfield hospital hyperbaric chamber.  Hoylake Coastguard 
rescue team were tasked to Murrayfield hospital to assist the 
helicopter crew with the casualty and to monitor the helicopter 
landing site. The casualty arrived at Murrayfield hospital for 
treatment.

Shetland Coastguard was alerted to a dive support vessel 
coming into Stromness with a diver suffering from suspected 
DCI, the skipper felt that it would be quickest to just run them to 
the chamber in own car, Shetland Coastguard arranged for the 
chamber to be alerted.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2012 12/169 
Three divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 15m.  
After 85 min they reached a depth of 6m.  After 94 min they 
ascended to 4m and then surfaced very slowly.  Their total dive 
duration was 101 min.  During the dive their computers 
indicated that their minimum remaining no stop time was 35 
min.  One of the divers then felt lethargic for the next two days 
but put this down to exercise and participation in another 
energetic sport.  On the third day his condition had deteriorated 
and he had difficulty focusing his eyes and his concentration 
was lacking.  He sought diving medical advice and was advised 
to attend a recompression facility.  DCI was diagnosed and the 
diver was given two sessions of recompression treatment.  
Fatigue and dehydration were cited as exacerbating factors

although the divers had taken care to drink what they felt to be 
adequate fluids. 
August 2012 12/326 
A dive vessel  contacted  MRCC Solent on VHF ch 67 stating 
that one male diver had reported 'pins & needles' in his hands 
after making a routine drift dive to 14m and successful 
completion of decompression stops before surfacing.  A medi-
link call was arranged between the duty dive medical officer and 
the dive vessel,  after extensive questioning the duty dive 
doctor deciding that the casualty needed to be airlifted to the 
nearest hyperbaric chamber. The dive buddy was not required 
this time. Coastguard rescue helicopter R-104 was tasked.  St 
Richards, which was the nearest chamber, landing site was 
manned by Selsey Coastguard and Portsmouth sector 
manager, who was in the area, was diverted and manned the 
landing site. South east coast ambulance service was tasked to 
the landing site.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2012 12/151 
A diver completed a 37 min dive to a maximum depth of 22m 
with a 3 min stop at 6m.  Shortly after surfacing he developed 
an ache in his shoulder, ‘pins and needles’ and started to feel 
dizzy.  He was placed on oxygen and his condition improved.   
The Coastguard was alerted and the diver was airlifted to a 
recompression facility.  He was diagnosed with a severe spinal 
DCI and needed several sessions of recompression.  This diver 
normally dived using nitrox but, on this occasion, he used air.  
During the dive he had been swimming hard against a current.  
The diver had had a DCI two years earlier, again using air.

Belfast Coastguard was informed of a diver with suspected skin 
DCI, information only call to inform us of a diver being 
transported to Craigavon dive chamber with a case of 
suspected skin DCI. No assistance required from Coastguards.  
(Coastguard report).

A diver became unwell after a dive to 65m. The diver was taken 
to a recompression chamber for treatment. (Media report only). 
September 2012 12/330 
Solent Coastguard received a 'Pan Pan' alert from a dive vessel 
on VHF ch16 stating that one male diver had just completed a 
dive to 56m and was showing signs of DCI. The casualty had a 
pain on his left side, initially thought it could have been caused 
by his diving cylinder hitting his side during his dive. His 
condition deteriorated and he was put on pure oxygen by the 
dive boat skipper. Throughout the dive nothing untoward had 
happened and all stops had been undertaken, his dive buddy 
with the same dive profile was fit and well.  A medi-link call was 
arranged between the duty dive medical officer and the dive 
boat; after extensive questioning the duty dive doctor decided 
that the casualty needed to be airlifted to the nearest hyperbaric 
chamber. The dive buddy was not required this time. Rescue 
helicopter R-104 was tasked to take the casualty to St Richards, 
which was the nearest chamber, landing site was manned by 
Selsey Coastguard and south east coast ambulance service 
were tasked to the landing site, evacuation was undertaken with 
the casualty.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2012 12/331 
A dive support vessel called Shetland Coastguard reporting 
they had a diver aboard suffering from suspected DCI. The 
diver was taken to Balfour hospital for treatment.  (Coastguard 
report). 
September 2012 12/231 
A diver had conducted two dives to 25m and 15m both within 
computer limits. During the dives the diver's buddy had 
experienced some problems with his buoyancy which resulted 
in some 'up and down' during the ascents. Following the first 
dive the diver noticed that he was dehydrated and drank lots of 
water. Following the second dive, after 1 hour 30 min, the diver 
felt a tingling in his hands and numbness in his fingers. The 
diver helpline was contacted and oxygen was administered. By 
the time an ambulance arrived the diver felt fine but was 
advised not to drive and was taken by ambulance to a 
recompression chamber where he received recompression 
treatment for suspected DCI. 
September 2012 12/164 
Three divers conducted a 31 min dive to 31m.  After a surface 
interval of 2 hours 45 min they dived to 20m for 57 min with a 6 
min stop at 6m.  The following day they dived to 25m for 40 min 
with a 6 min stop at 6m.   Some time later, back on shore, one 
of the divers noticed 'pins and needles' in his left thigh.  This 
sensation then spread down to his knee and calf muscle.  He 
was placed on oxygen and given fluids to drink.  Diving medical 
advice was sought, the Coastguard was alerted and the diver 
was airlifted to a recompression facility for treatment.  A second 
diver also experienced 'pins and needles' and a feeling of 
coldness in his left foot and ankle, but these symptoms receded 
and he took no action.  The third diver experienced 'pins and 
needles' in his left leg whilst driving home, but put this down to 
the drive.  The following day the symptoms had returned and 
increased in both divers.  They both sought diving medical 
advice and received recompression treatment.  The 'pins and 
needles' remained for one of the three but resolved five days 
later. 
September 2012 12/337 
Brixham and Portland Coastguard assisted in a medical transfer 
by R-193 of two divers from Frenchay Bristol to DDRC for 
treatment. No further details of where incident occurred are 
available.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2012 12/200 
Shetland Coastguard was alerted by a dive support vessel of a 
diver suffering from suspected DCI, symptoms included 
numbness in both legs.  The diver was conscious. Shetland 
Coastguard tasked Kirkwall lifeboat which recovered the diver 
and was met by an ambulance.   The casualty was taken, by 
ambulance, to Balfour hospital for treatment.  (Coastguard 
report). 
September 2012 12/338 
Shetland Coastguard was made aware of two divers being 
transferred to hyperbaric chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard 
report). 
September 2012 12/377 
A diver completed a 58 min dive to a maximum depth of 34m.  
She completed all necessary stops plus a 3 min safety stop at 
6m.  She switched from nitrox 30 to nitrox 44 at 21m during the 
ascent.  After the dive she noticed an itchiness across her 
stomach and right breast.  She put this down to irritation from 
her undersuit and took an antihistamine tablet.  After a 2 hour 
40 min surface interval she conducted a dive to 25m for 48 min 
including a 3 min safety stop at 6m.  After this dive her 
abdomen and right breast became very painful; it felt like 
bruising.  She began to feel unwell and was placed on oxygen; 
this alleviated the pain.  The Coastguard was alerted and the 
diver was returned to shore.  She was taken by ambulance to a 
recompression facility.  The affected areas were now exhibiting

a dark purple rash and swelling.  She was diagnosed with a skin 
and mild lymphatic DCI and given recompression therapy.  The 
following day the symptoms had reappeared and she received 
further recompression treatment.  The condition slowly resolved 
over the next few days.  She was advised to seek examination 
for a PFO.  Her buddy was unaffected.

Shetland Coastguard was alerted to a diver who had suffered a 
broken wrist having fallen on deck, the vessel was heading into 
Houton to meet an ambulance for onward transportation to 
Balfour for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
October 2011 12/360 
Casualty was practicing snorkel regulator exchange at the 
surface when she aspirated water and went into panic. She was 
towed to shore and given oxygen and her inhaler. Her asthma 
had been declared on her medical and she had been cleared as 
fit to dive by a doctor. 
October 2011 12/024 
A diver on a training course with a rebreather had conducted a 
dive the previous day to a maximum depth of 10m for a total 
duration of 31 min.  On the second day the diver and his 
instructor were conducting a dive to a maximum depth of 32m 
and had been in the water for 82 min when the diver became 
unresponsive at a depth of 12m. The diver was raised to the 
surface and the alarm raised. A rescue boat came alongside to 
find the diver was not breathing and had his head underwater. 
The diver was de-kitted and landed into the rescue boat, his 
airway cleared and CPR was started. Two people administered 
CPR with oxygen enriched rescue breaths and the diver began 
breathing again after 5 to 6 min. Air ambulance crew took over 
after 8 min and the diver was airlifted to hospital. The diver was 
reported to be diabetic requiring to monitor his blood sugar 
levels. 
November 2011 12/246 
Stornoway Coastguard was informed by a dive support vessel of 
a diver who had completed two dives and was complaining of 
headaches and had blood stained sputum.  The vessel was 
alongside and the casualty was being administered oxygen. A 
medical link call was established, the doctor advised it was most 
likely to be trauma rather than dive related, a friend of the 
casualty took the diver by car to Uist and Barra hospital to be 
examined. Stornoway Coastguard tasked both an ambulance 
and Benbecula CRT to obtain details and check that the casualty 
had got to hospital safely.  (Coastguard report). 
December 2011 12/249 
MRCC Falmouth were contacted on VHF channel 16 by a dive 
support vessel reporting one of their divers suffering from a 
perforated eardrum, the casualty made a normal ascent with 
assistance from the buddy diver, once the vessel had recovered 
the remaining divers they returned to its home port of Mylor near 
Falmouth where it was met by an ambulance, the casualty was 
assessed by a paramedic and taken to Royal Cornwall Hospital 
Treliske for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
January 2012 12/048 
A diver was entering the water using a giant stride entry when his 
cylinder caught on the side causing the regulator first stage to 
strike the diver on the back of the head. The diver was recovered  
from the water and checked over for signs of concussion and 
monitored over time. 
February 2012 12/040 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 21m for a total 
duration of 36 min. During his ascent at the end of the dive the 
diver lost control of his buoyancy at a depth of 9m and made an 
ascent direct to the surface. The diver's computer did not show 
any alarms and initially the diver did not display any signs or 
symptoms of DCI. After de-kitting the diver said that he did not 
feel well and then he collapsed. The diver was caught by others 
and laid down as he was barely conscious; the alarm was raised. 
The on site safety team attended and oxygen was administered 
as a precaution. After a few minutes the diver came round and 
remained on oxygen for 15 min. The diver was subsequently 
found to have been wearing an additional undersuit but had not 
adjusted his weights. The diver was also found to have worked 
12 hour shifts for the preceding three weeks and had finished 
work at 3am the night before, had had two hours sleep and then 
driven 200 miles to the dive site. 
February 2012 12/044 
A trainee diver had previously conducted a try dive. On the 
evening of the incident he had completed a swimming test 
without difficulty and was being instructed in equipment 
assembly when he complained of feeling breathless and asked 
to sit down. The trainee began to feel faint and was attended by 
a doctor who was a club member and the pool lifeguard was 
requested to get him a drink from the vending machine whilst the 
doctor took a history. The trainee recovered quickly as he started 
to drink, his colour improved and the doctor decided he had felt 
faint due to lack of food taken during the day. The trainee was 
not allowed to train further that day and he was advised on the 
importance of eating properly before exercise. 
March 2012 12/043 
A pair of divers were walking with their equipment to the water's 
edge at an inland site when one of them spotted a diver in the 
water who did not look well. He asked the diver if he was alright 
but got no response; the diver then slumped in the water. The 
diver dropped his own equipment and jumped into the water and 
tried to support the now unconscious diver and struggled to 
remove the diver's rebreather harness and had to use his line 
cutter to cut him out. Another diver entered the water and tried to 
give rescue breaths but was unable to and said there must be a 
blockage. The diver was recovered from the water and CPR was 
started. The unconscious diver had yellow froth around his 
mouth and nose that was being pumped out with each 
compression. An oxygen kit was provided and one of the 
rescuers took the pocket mask from the kit and started giving 
rescue breaths but had difficulty confirming that the chest was 
rising. After a period of time the diver appeared to be making 

   NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2012 
 
22        ©BSAC - 2012 
efforts to breathe and so chest compressions and rescue 
breaths were halted and the diver was given oxygen from a 
demand mask which was purged to assist breathing effort.  The 
diver's suit was cut open from the neck to the navel to reduce 
restrictions. An ambulance arrived and transported the diver to 
hospital where he was kept in over the next two nights and was 
due for further tests on the third day. The diver was reported to 
have been pulled out of the water at the same site with breathing 
difficulties some five months previously. 
March 2012 12/215 
Three divers entered the water for a shore dive from a shallow 
beach. The three swam out on the surface using snorkels and 
found the visibility to be poor at around 1.5m and so swam out 
further on the surface until the visibility improved to around 2m 
approximately 100m from shore. The group descended and 
stayed at a depth of 5m for a few minutes before one of the 
divers noticed a slight swell. As the diver was susceptible to 
seasickness she began to feel queasy. After 15 min the group 
changed direction and reached a maximum depth of 11m. 
Approximately 19 min into the dive the group decided that the 
visibility was too poor and thus they would return to shore. As 
they turned the diver who felt seasick knew she was going to be 
sick and signalled to ascend. The three started to ascend and, at 
around 6m, one of the others in the group ascended quicker than 
the other two. On surfacing they asked if the diver who had 
ascended quickly was alright but she was already heading back 
to shore and said she was fine. As they were swimming back the 
seasick diver was sick, which she attributed to the effect of the 
swell and the salami sandwich she had for lunch. Total dive time 
was 23 min. 
March 2012 12/069 
An instructor and two students entered a swimming pool for a 
training dive with both students using new equipment. One of the 
students was of a very slight frame and had previously been 
using a child size BCD with a 7 lt cylinder. She was using a wing 
style BCD that had been bought second hand and had a 10 lt 
cylinder fitted. The group checked their weighting and 
descended to the bottom of the pool at a depth of 4m. All 
signalled OK and then the instructor demonstrated a fin pivot and 
asked the student to mimic this. The student indicated that she 
wasn't happy and pointed to her forehead. The instructor 
presumed this was a sinus problem and led the group up to a 
depth of around 2m and settled there. On checking, the student 
appeared uncomfortable in her BCD and had risen slightly. She 
then flipped forward forcefully to try and adjust the BCD and to 
descend to the other pair. The student's cylinder flew up her 
back and the regulator first stage struck the student on the back 
of her head knocking her unconscious. The instructor responded 
immediately and raised the diver up to the surface using a 
controlled buoyant lift and the second student followed them up. 
The student was recovered to the side of the pool and lifted from 
the water.  Her equipment was removed whilst the instructor 
secured the second student on the surface. The student 
recovered consciousness shortly after being recovered from the 
water and was placed in the recovery position by the pool 
lifeguards. The student was upset and embarrassed and 
suffering slight vision problems. An ambulance was called and 
the student was taken to hospital where she was checked out 
and discharged a few hours later. Inspection of the BCD 
confirmed a fair degree of movement between the tank and 
jacket and the jacket was a little large for the student.  The 
problem has since been rectified by wearing additional clothes 
and adding releasable crotch straps. 
March 2012 12/074 
A group of three divers conducted an uneventful dive to a 
maximum depth of 17m and a total duration of 43 min including a 
safety stop of 3 min at 6m. After exiting the water one of the 
divers complained of feeling unwell, lightheaded and nauseous. 
The diver was laid down and give oxygen via a non-rebreather 
mask. The diver experienced an improvement in symptoms 
although admitting to not feeling 100%. Planned further dives 
that day were aborted. 
April 2012 12/234 
Ten days after the incident in report 12/233 an instructor 
conducted an uneventful dive to a maximum depth of 23m for a 
total of 22 min. The instructor had deployed a DSMB after 10 min 
and the pair had planned practice safety stops at 12m for 1 min, 
9m for 1 min and completed a 3 min safety stop at 6m. After 
agreeing to ascend the pair started to swim upwards but, after 
two turns of the reel the instructor became disorientated, felt 
nauseous and suffered spinning vertigo.  She began retching 
through her regulator and vomited a small amount of phlegm. 
The instructor managed to surface slowly and then vomited once 
on the surface. Her buddy asked what the problem was and once 
she explained he took hold of her and turned her to face the 
approaching RHIB. The diver was assisted to de-kit and 
recovered into the boat and, although the diver felt sick, the boat 
handler seemed only concerned with handing over control of the 
boat so he could go diving. The instructor reluctantly took the 
helm and deployed divers. The instructor's buddy took over the 
boat for practice whilst divers were in the water then the 
instructor took control again for the diver recovery. On returning 
to shore the instructor declined to go out on the boat again and 
went to her car and slept for around an hour. She continued to 
feel nauseous and off balance for approximately 2 hours 30 min 
before the symptoms subsided. Oxygen was not provided. The 
next day on the return journey home crossing a high moor the 
instructor cleared her ears and again became dizzy and off 
balance with symptoms lasting around 30 min. Two days later 
the instructor became dizzy and off balance on getting out of bed 
in the morning and visited her GP the next day who referred her 
to an ENT specialist. Whilst waiting for an appointment the 
instructor continued to experience episodes of dizziness and 
nausea every three to four days for an eight week period. She 
was diagnosed with a traumatic perilymphatic fistula of the right 
ear almost certainly caused by the ascent in 12/233. The 
instructor was referred for an operation to close the fistula in 
order to allow her to fly and dive again.  She had the operation 
and was awaiting a three month post surgery final test for 
clearance to resume diving. 
April 2012 12/068 
A pair of divers entered the water for a planned dive to a 
maximum depth of 25m. The pair descended and one of the 
divers' mask kept flooding and he had to keep clearing it. The 
pair reached a depth of 26m and the diver continued to clear his 
mask; the buddy swam towards a gully taking photographs. After 
around 15 min the diver felt himself ascending so he dumped 
gas and settled onto some rocks and managed to clear his 
mask. He checked his computer which showed a depth of 23m. 
The diver felt he couldn't breathe, could not see his buddy and 
felt disoriented, visibility was reported to be around 6m. His 
buddy reappeared and asked if he was OK to which the diver 
indicated he wasn't and signalled his difficulty breathing. The 
buddy held onto the diver and the pair continued the dive. After 
22 min the pair decided to ascend and the diver assisted his 
buddy to deploy a DSMB. The pair ascended to 6m and 
completed a safety stop for 3 min although the diver was still 
having difficulty breathing. Once the pair surfaced the diver 
removed his regulator but still found he could not breathe easily. 
The cover RHIB came alongside and at that point the diver 
swallowed some seawater. The diver managed to climb into the 
RHIB, drank some fresh water and was sick almost straight 
away. Other divers surfaced and were recovered and two of 
them began to assemble the oxygen kit but discovered it was 
empty. The diver was returned to shore and given nitrox 40 to 
breathe from one of the divers on the shore.  The diver was 

 
 
NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2012    
?BSAC - 2012   23 
advised to go to hospital to be checked over. On route to hospital 
the diver lost some use of his legs. On arrival at hospital the 
diver was admitted and given oxygen and given a series of tests 
including ECG, blood tests and a chest x-ray. The diver was then 
transferred to another hospital for observation and further tests. 
The diver was discharged the following day and felt lethargic and 
had no energy for the following week. 
April 2012 12/202 
A student diver on a training dive experienced pain in both ears 
at 3m during descent and again at 6m whilst static on a platform; 
he was able to equalise on both occasions. The student 
conducted a number of skills. The dive was terminated after 
maximum dive time of 15 min due to buoyancy problems. On 
ascent the student could hear his ears 'bubbling' but experienced 
no further pain. On the surface the student noticed his hearing 
had been affected, he could hear others clearly but his own voice 
sounded dull and muffled. The student had planned two further 
dives that day but decided not to. He visited his doctor the 
following day who diagnosed ear barotrauma. 
April 2012 12/092 
A trainee was involved in alternative source training at a 
maximum depth of 8m.  She completed three controlled ascents.  
During the dive her mask kept flooding and she had to 
continually clear it.  During the final ascent the trainee was the 
recipient and she became breathless and panicked a little at the 
start.  After the third ascent they descended once more to 
continue with the dive.  At the bottom the trainee felt pain in her 
ears and then began to feel dizzy and to experience visual 
disturbances.  She then felt nauseous and had a strong pain in 
her head.  She began shaking and breathing rapidly.  She 
signalled to abort the dive.  The diver was wearing a semi-drysuit 
and was cold.  Once back in the boat she was given a warm 
drink and then stated that she felt dizzy and unwell.  She was 
placed on oxygen.  She was taken to the shore, the Coastguard 
was alerted and diving medical advice was sought.  She felt 'pins 
and needles' in her feet and fingers and felt very tired.  The diver 
was moved into a sheltered area and changed into dry clothing.  
The diver was airlifted to a recompression facility but no 
treatment was needed. 
April 2012 12/075 
A pair of divers conducted four dives in a day of 29m for 47 min, 
23m for 44 min, 21m for 39 min & 8m for 29 min with around 2 
hours surface interval between dives and all safety stops advised 
by computers followed. Approximately 3 min after surfacing from 
the final dive, one of the divers experienced numbness and 
tingling in his right calf muscle and mild aches in the joints of his 
fingers in both hands. During the final dive the diver had 
experienced cramp in the same right calf muscle, which had 
been relieved by stretching. The diver also had a history of 
juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, which he had not received 
treatment for in around 12 years but which infrequently caused 
him to experience mild joint pain without any clear trigger.  After 
explaining his symptoms the diver was placed on oxygen and a 
diving doctor was called for advice which was to attend the 
nearest A&E to be checked out by a physician. The diver 
remained on oxygen during transport to hospital and after 
assessment the diver was discharged after 90 min. The diver 
was advised to seek screening for a PFO. 
April 2012 12/218 
A group of three divers, a dive leader, a trainee and a sports 
diver, entered the water from the shore for an evening dive with 
no training involved. The group descended to a maximum depth 
of 15m. After 10 min the dive leader became disorientated and 
was unable to focus on his compass. As the silt was becoming 
disturbed the leader signalled for the group to surface to regain 
their bearings and the three made a controlled ascent to the 
surface. On the surface the trainee had a small amount of blood 
coming from his nose and the leader remarked on this but was 
told it was normal. He asked both divers if they were happy to 
continue and they agreed. During the descent the trainee 
experienced a sharp uncomfortable pain in his ear. At this point 
the trainee was seen to dump all his air from his BCD and sink 
rapidly. At the same time he managed to clear his ears and the 
pain disappeared. The party regrouped on the bottom, 
exchanged OK signals and continued with the dive.  They 
surfaced after a total dive time of 30 min. After surfacing the 
trainee noticed a 'squelching' in his right ear and there was a 
muffled ringing noise. The trainee held his ear and when the dive 
leader noticed this he asked what the problem was and, after 
establishing what the trainee was experiencing, advised him to 
contact his own doctor and a diving doctor. 
May 2012 12/367 
An instructor and an assistant took two students on the deep 
dive. The casualty first needed extra weight to descend, then felt 
discomfort during the descent but managed to equalise down to 
the bottom. During the ascent, the instructor helped the casualty 
to adjust his buoyancy at which time both dropped by 4m before 
resuming ascent. The casualty tried to equalise his ears during 
the ascent, the instructor signalled him not to. At the surface, the 
casualty reported that his ears 'felt funny'. Over the next 2 hours 
there was some improvement. Suspected burst ear drum. 
May 2012 12/213 
A diver on an instructor training course was entering the water 
down a series of steps constructed from gravel retained behind 
railway sleepers. On one of the steps the gravel had been 
washed out leaving a large hole in the step. The diver's right foot 
and complete fin went into the hole and she fell and bruised her 
lower right leg. The dive was aborted and first aid was provided 
but no hospital treatment was required. The entry point was 
closed and remedial work was undertaken.

(Coastguard report). 
May 2012 12/368 
The instructor sent a buddy pair away to complete a navigation 
skill. One of the buddy pair returned alone looking concerned. 
The diver signalled that he had lost his buddy who had ascended 
on his own. The instructor ended the dive and began an ascent 
with the group. At 15m they could see the missing diver on the 
shotline. They joined the missing diver and asked if he was 
alright. He signalled that he had a problem with his wrist and a 
free flow had left him low on air. They made a 3 min safety stop 
and following this the diver still had a problem with his wrist. The 
instructor provided an alternate source and extended the safety 
stop for a further number of minutes. (19 min total).  Their 
maximum depth was 35m.  On the surface the diver explained 
that he had had a free flow and thought that he had ascended 
too quickly. He complained of a tingling wrist so first aid and 
oxygen was administered. They used a full cylinder of oxygen 
but the diver still experienced tingling and was shivering so they 
called the emergency services. The diver was taken to the 
hospital for further assessment but did not require treatment. 
June 2012 12/283 
Dive vessel brought an injured diver ashore after a twin air set 
had toppled onto his foot possibly breaking a metatarsal. The 
vessel arranged an ambulance for the casualty, no Coastguard 
involvement.  (Coastguard report).

June 2012 12/126 
Two instructors and two trainees were engaged in an exercise to 
practice ascents using alternative sources from a depth of 6m.  
The first ascent involved one of the trainees as the recipient.  
After this they descended again.  Once back on the seabed this 
trainee felt dizzy and had spinning sensations.  She felt sleepy 
and disorientated and was unresponsive to signals.  One of the 
instructors brought her to the surface and she was towed to the 
shore.  Once ashore she quickly recovered.  No subsequent ill 
effects were experienced.  Underwater visibility had been low 
and there had been water movement as a result of swell.

The casualty was the instructor on an open water course with 
one student. He had his student complete a mask skill during 
which the student panicked and made for the surface. The 
instructor slowed his ascent but still exceeded the recommended 
limit. After this ascent, they dropped down again for a couple 
more skills, then the student exited the water and instructor 
helped out another instructor with their student for underwater 
skills. When the instructor exited the water, he felt dizzy and later 
vomited. Oxygen was provided, he was taken to hospital by car, 
where they put him on oxygen for 6 hours. 
June 2012 12/216 
A diver entered the water for a solo dive by descending pier 
steps and then walking backwards across the shore with fins 
fitted. The shoreline was made up of rocks and stones covered 
in seaweed and very slippery. The diver slipped on a large stone 
and suffered a sprain/strain of the muscle on his left leg. On 
entering the water the diver finned on the surface to deeper 
water and then descended to a maximum depth of 3m for a dive 
lasting a total of 27 min. On surfacing the diver retraced his 
surface swim back to the uneven beach and walked with 
difficulty back to the pier steps. The diver requested assistance 
from a passer-by to climb the steps and returned to his car to de-
kit. His left calf muscle swelled up and the diver sought medical 
attention the following day at hospital. 
June 2012 12/128 
A diver completed a 33 min dive to a depth of 14m, then, after a 
surface interval of 5 hours 37 min, to 14m for 30 min.  The 
following day he dived to 18m for 30 min.  Following this dive he 
complained of a pain in his right side when breathing.  Diving 
medical advice was sought and the problem was not thought to 
be diving related.  He had a chest X-ray but no abnormality was 
found. 
June 2012 12/370 
The casualty tagged along on a drysuit course to test his new 
drysuit. He experienced buoyancy problems and stated that he 
perforated his ear drum during a depth fluctuation during the 
ascent.  Doctor's examination revealed redness on the ear drum 
and possibly a small hole. 
June 2012 12/106 
Two divers conducted a 25 min dive to a maximum depth of 
33m.  The divers descended a shotline to the seabed and 
followed a line that had been laid a few metres to a wreck. 
Following an uneventful dive the pair relocated the bottom line to 
regain the shot. One of the divers found she was unable to 
ascend the shotline because her fin had become entangled in 
the bottom line. As she tried to free her foot she kicked up the silt 
reducing visibility. She tried to signal the problem to her buddy 
but this was misunderstood and so she reached for the knife on 
her leg to cut herself free. In doing so she dislodged the 
regulator from her mouth and took the primary regulator from her 
buddy's mouth; he switched to his pony regulator. The buddy 
attempted to lift the diver using a controlled buoyant lift but was 
unable to lift her. The diver's own main regulator was free flowing 
also reducing visibility and her buddy was unable to stop it. The 
diver was becoming very agitated and the buddy checked 
around the diver's body, found the line entangling the fin and cut 
it. During this manoeuvre the diver was without a regulator for a 
short period but signalled OK and the pair started their ascent. 
During the ascent the diver had a high breathing rate and on a 
number of occasions took the regulator from the buddy's mouth. 
Towards the end of the ascent the diver lost consciousness and 
her buddy brought her to the surface.  Both divers were 
recovered onto their RHIBs, one on to each boat.  Resuscitation 
techniques were applied to the unconscious diver and she 
quickly responded.  Both divers were placed on oxygen and the 
Coastguard was alerted.  A lifeboat and a helicopter were tasked 
to assist.  The RHIB headed back to harbour but ran into fog.  
They stopped at this point to allow the lifeboat to locate them.  
Both divers were taken by lifeboat and then helicopter to a 
recompression chamber for treatment.  The rescuing diver was 
discharged later that day and the other diver was kept in hospital 
for observation due to inhaled water in her lungs and was 
discharged the following afternoon. 
June 2012 12/172 
An instructor and 2 student divers were practicing controlled 
buoyant lift drills from a depth of 12m when one of the divers 
experienced a leak in his drysuit and took on water. Total dive 
time was 9 min and, on surfacing, one of the students 
experienced ear pain, chest discomfort/pain and coughed up 
blood. The student was given oxygen, an ambulance was called 
and advice sought from a recompression chamber. The diver 
was taken to hospital by ambulance and remained in hospital for 
observation for thirteen days. The diver was diagnosed as 
having suffered from previously undiagnosed medical problems, 
not diving related. 
July 2012 12/371 
A group of young divers aged 14 to 16 were at an event where 
they could try scuba diving in a swimming pool. A group of 
students were briefed then entered the water and put on their kit. 
On the surface they had a further briefing and then they 
descended in the shallow end and continued to dive around the 
swimming pool playing games with a ball. The casualty didn’t 
realise he was nearly out of air, and when he ran out he swam 
directly to the surface for help. The instructor came and helped 
him to the side of the pool. When he was changed the casualty 
complained of chest pain. He was monitored and the emergency 
services were called for advice. They sent a paramedic who 
decided that the casualty did not need further medical treatment. 
He was advised to rest and have a further check-up if the pain 
persisted. 
July 2012 12/173 
A student and an instructor conducted controlled buoyant lift 
training drills at a maximum depth of 7m on a platform.  After a 
surface interval of 15 min they descended for an exploratory 
dive. The student reported subsequently that he had felt anxious 
and breathless following the first dive but had not reported this to 
the instructor. After reaching a maximum depth of 18m the pair 
were at a depth of 16m; the student moved behind the instructor 
and when the instructor turned she saw the student heading 
upwards. The instructor took hold of the student who then 
indicated that all was not well and that he wished to surface; he 
started to make an ascent. The student was above the instructor 
who was then unable to reach any of the student's dump valves 
to prevent a fast ascent. On surfacing the instructor towed the 
student to shore and assisted him from the water and to de-kit. 
The student reported shortness of breath and a tight chest. The 
student was put on oxygen and laid down and the incident 
reported to the dive centre staff who monitored the student for

30 min before releasing him. The student suffered no long term 
effects and has resumed his training. 
July 2012 12/208 
A group of five divers and a coxswain left harbour in a RHIB. 
Two of the divers had brought air with them whilst the other three 
had purchased air from a local dive centre. On the first dive one 
diver complained of a bad taste from his mouthpiece but 
attributed this to it having been in the boat's bilge water. Another 
diver thought his air had an unusual taste but his buddy checked 
it and did not think it did. Following the dive nothing unusual was 
reported and the RHIB moved to the second site. 30 min after 
the second dive one of the divers started to vomit and 
complained of a headache but this was attributed to seasickness 
and the effects of a late night and an early start with no 
breakfast. All other divers reported no problems although one 
had conducted 11 min of stops and opted not to conduct the 
planned third dive. The diver with seasickness considered he 
was well enough to dive and hoped that the dive would improve 
his sickness but it did not. On return to shore one of the group 
felt unusually tired and developed a cough. Another in the group 
found it hard to motivate himself to leave for dinner, an unusual 
occurrence. All three attributed the symptoms to a long day's 
diving and, for one diver, residual seasickness. The following 
morning the seasick diver felt only slightly better, another had 
nausea and diarrhoea despite limiting his alcohol intake the night 
before.  The third diver now had a headache despite he and the 
seasick diver not having taken alcohol. Only the two divers who 
had brought their own air felt fine and it was decided to miss the 
first planned dive of the day and to start diving in the afternoon. 
Whilst loading the boat for the afternoon dive the group noticed a 
local charter boat returning early. The divers onboard indicated 
that they had received bad gas fills from the local dive centre. On 
checking the cylinders on the dive RHIB all were found to have a 
significant odour. The divers who had been feeling unwell now 
went on oxygen, drank water and contacted a diver helpline who 
advised attending A&E.  After tests all were discharged from 
hospital, although still feeling unwell.  The dive centre closed the 
filling station, cleaned the system, apologised to the divers and 
agreed to oxygen clean and refill the affected cylinders at no 
cost. 
July 2012 12/155 
A diver conducted a number of dives over several days.  Her last 
dive was to 25m for 30 min with a 3 min safety stop at 6m.  
During this stop she began to feel breathless.  She had 60 bar 
remaining but switched to her pony regulator as she knew that 
this was easier to breathe from.  She indicated the problem to 
her buddy.  At the surface she felt very weak and her buddy 
helped her onto the diver lift.  A crew member helped her to a 
seat and she was helped to de-kit.  She was struggling to 
breathe and going blue so she was placed on oxygen.  She 
developed a 'rattling' noise as she breathed.  The boat returned 
to the shore and medical advice was sought.  She was 
diagnosed with fluid on her lungs and she was transferred on 
oxygen, by ambulance, to hospital.  Tests verified that she had 
fluid on her lungs and salt water aspiration syndrome was 
diagnosed.  Her condition progressively improved. 
August 2012 12/220 
During pool training a student developed a skin irritation which 
was itchy on his wrists and ankles. The diver conducted two 
open water dives on day three of his course and noticed that the 
irritations were becoming a little worse. A duty doctor was 
contacted and the student advised to change his diving suit and 
continue diving. Following a dive on day four to 18m for 27 min  
the diver reported worsening conditions with severe rashes 
spreading up his arms and his hands were swollen. On advice 
from the duty doctor the student was placed on oxygen, given 
fluids and driven to a recompression chamber for assessment. 
The student was diagnosed as having a strong dermatological 
reaction to something, possibly neoprene, and was given 
medication and discharged. 
August 2012 12/372 
While getting into the water, the casualty slipped on a rock and 
broke his ankle. He was helped out of his drysuit by training staff 
and taken to hospital by ambulance.

Two lifeboats launched to assist injured diver.  (RNLI report). 
August 2012 12/168 
An instructor, two trainees and an assisting instructor were 
engaged in a series of training exercises.  They descended to a 
depth of 2m and practiced buoyancy control and mask clearing.  
They resurfaced and were planning to surface swim to a location 
where they could dive to 6m.  One of the trainees said that he 
felt over-weighted and he swam to the entry point.  He 
complained that he could not get his buoyancy under control.  It 
was found that his BCD direct feed did not work even though it 
had when he practiced buoyancy control.  The problem could not 
be resolved and they agreed that the trainee would conduct the 
next exercise using his drysuit buoyancy alone.  They dived to 
6m and again, successfully, conducted buoyancy control 
practice.  They then commenced an exercise to practice ascent 
using an alternative source.  The diver who had had the BCD 
problem acted as the donor and the other trainee as the 
recipient.  The ascent progressed well and air was seen coming 
from the shoulder dump of the donor diver.  At the surface the 
donor diver was unable to make himself buoyant and he became 
stressed.  The instructor tried to inflate the troubled diver's 
drysuit but could not.  The diver panicked; he was just below the 
surface and he took his regulator out of his mouth.  The 
instructor tried to give him her octopus regulator but he resisted.  
The other trainee then successfully put his octopus regulator into 
the troubled diver's mouth and held it there.  They then towed the 
diver to the shore.  Once ashore the diver was unresponsive, he 
was very pale, hyperventilating and his pupils were dilated.  He 
was removed from the water and placed on oxygen.  The diver 
was very lethargic and seemed slow to recover.  The emergency 
services were alerted and an ambulance and helicopter 
attended.  The diver was airlifted to a recompression facility but 
was not recompressed.  He was released later that day, fully 
recovered.  It was later concluded that the problem was due to 
the diver's drysuit dump valve being fully open, making it 
impossible for him to gain positive buoyancy at the surface. 
August 2012 12/188 
The previous night students had been involved in rescue skills 
training in a pool with all students acting as both rescuers and 
simulated casualties. The following morning one of the students 
complained of a painful neck. The student thought this may have 
been due to the strain of being extended too frequently during 
training. During training it had not hurt and she had not indicated 
there had been a problem until the following day. Expecting the 
pain would pass with time the diver did nothing but the pain 
increased over the weekend and she consulted her doctor the 
following Monday. The doctor determined that some of the discs 
in her neck had been displaced and advised that she should not 
continue to dive until the pain had gone. The diver had to wear a 
soft collar and was referred to a physiotherapist. 
August 2012 12/153 
Two divers were sitting on the side of a large dive boat ready to 
enter the water.  One diver was about 1.5m forward of the other.  
The skipper indicated that the divers should enter but this was 
only heard by the forward diver.  This diver rolled backwards into 
the water.  The instruction was repeated and the second diver 

   NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2012 
 
26        ©BSAC - 2012 
started to roll backwards.  The boat had moved forwards in the 
water placing the first diver directly under the second.  A warning 
was shouted but it was too late and second diver’s twin cylinders 
struck the top of the first diver’s head.  The boat had significant 
freeboard resulting in a serious impact.  The diver received two 
large and one small cuts to his head, abrasions to his left cheek, 
a black eye, bruising and a whiplash injury to his neck.  It was 
reported that a similar incident had occurred previously. 
August 2012 12/174 
Following a dive earlier in the day on a wreck to a maximum 
depth of 28m for an unknown duration but including stops of 1 
min at 6m and 6 min at 3m a pair of divers conducted a second 
dive after a 3 hour surface interval. After reaching a maximum 
depth of 32m the pair were at a depth of 28m when one of the 
diver's regulator stopped working. The diver switched to his 
buddy's alternate source and the pair started to ascend. At a 
depth of 20m, during the ascent, the buddy's cylinder had been 
fully depleted.  The buddy inflated his suit and the pair made a 
buoyant ascent direct to the surface without completing any 
safety stops. On returning to the boat the buddy told others of the 
situation and to be aware of any problems that might develop. 
The buddy had a slight pain in his right ear but no other 
symptoms developed. The following day the diver with the faulty 
regulator was advised not to dive until the regulator was 
checked. The buddy joined another pair for a wreck dive but after 
descending to 2-3m his ear started to throb and he terminated 
his dive and returned to the boat and returned home later that 
day.  The following day the diver awoke to find blood and mucus 
coming from his right ear and he experienced a headache, 
nausea and dizziness. The diver contacted the Coastguard who 
dispatched an ambulance, which took the diver to hospital where 
he was diagnosed with a ruptured eardrum with water ingress 
that had caused an infection. The diver received treatment for his 
ear infection. The faulty regulator had previously been converted 
by the manufacturer for left hand delivery and had been used on 
three previous dives without problem. The regulator has been 
returned to the manufacturer for assessment. 
August 2012 12/147 
A 12 year old diver was trying to help when a trailer was being 
positioned to recover an RHIB.  He slipped and fell under the 
wheel of the unloaded trailer.  The trailer ran over his left shin 
causing him serious pain.  He was taken to the nearby RNLI 
boathouse and then to the local A&E.  No fracture was found, 
just some bruising.  After a while he was able to put weight on 
this leg normally. 
August 2012 12/319 
Solent Coastguard received a 'Mayday' from a dive support 
vessel on ch16 reporting an unconscious diver.  The casualty 
had surfaced from a 50m dive having missed no stops, boarded 
the dive boat, had a cup of tea, and then collapsed unconscious. 
This was his first dive of the day and he was not accompanied by 
a buddy. Last dive 19th August. The dive boat skipper 
immediately administered oxygen and the diver came round very 
quickly. The diver was responsive and not suffering from any 
aches or pains but did have a nose bleed. Coastguard rescue 
helicopter  R-104 was tasked. The Duty Dive Medical Officer was 
contacted and alerted St. Richards hospital Chichester, Casualty 
airlifted and taken to St. Richards hospital.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2012 12/373 
As an instructor walked down a set of uneven step towards the 
water with a cylinder on his back, he fell, trapped his ankle and 
twisted it as he slipped down the steps. He was taken to hospital.

Brixham Coastguard tasked Plymouth RNLI all weather lifeboat 
and rescue helicopter from RMB Chivenor R-169 proceeded to a 
dive boat after they called for assistance for a diver with head 
injuries, The casualty was losing consciousness but became 
distressed upon the arrival of the helicopter. The casualty was 
taken by lifeboat to Millbay, Plymouth where he was transferred 
by a waiting ambulance to Derriford hospital.  (Coastguard 
report). 
September 2012 12/152 
A diver conducted a dive to 35m for 40 min with a 12 min stop at 
3m.  2 hours later he dived to 42m for 37 min with a 10 min stop 
at 3m.   On surfacing he felt dizzy and nauseous.  He had a 
pressure imbalance and a ringing in his right ear.   He suffered 
from sickness throughout the return boat trip.  Once ashore 
diving medical advice was sought; an ear problem was 
diagnosed and the diver was advised to attend a recompression 
facility.  The conclusion was that the diver had suffered a 
barotrauma to his ear and he was taken by ambulance to 
hospital for overnight observation.  The symptoms slowly 
resolved and it was thought possible that the onset of a cold may 
have contributed to the incident. 
September 2012 12/374 
During a swimming pool training session, at a maximum depth of 
2m, a trainee was struggling with snorkel regulator exchange 
and regulator recovery so one of the instructors took him on a 
one to one basis. The trainee and the instructor practiced 
alternate source use with the instructor being donor. 20 seconds 
into the skill, the trainee lost consciousness but kept the 
regulator in his mouth. The instructor took him to the surface, he 
was lifted from the water, at which point he regained 
consciousness. Care of the trainee was taken over by the pool's 
teaching staff. 
September 2012 12/228 
Prior to a day's diving a diver explained to others in his group 
that he normally used nitrox because he regularly suffered from 
headaches following a dive. A discussion took place regarding 
skip breathing and how CO2 build up may be a problem. The 
diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 18m for 36 min 
and then 3 hours 25 min later conducted a dive to a maximum 
depth of 20m for a total of 37 min. The diver was seen after the 
dive to have removed his kit and partially taken off his drysuit 
and looked a little pale. On checking, the diver reported that he 
had a headache that had started during the dive and that he was 
feeling nauseous. Others in the group went to assist recovery of 
his equipment to a site transport bus. The diver appeared very 
unwell and was not engaging with others but the group's oxygen 
set was in the car park at the top of the slope. In reassuring the 
diver that oxygen was available at the car park another diver, not 
associated with the group, overheard and offered his own 
oxygen equipment which the diver breathed. Shortly after this 
another diver, who was a doctor approached, and offered to 
conduct a neurological examination which he did and found no 
evidence suggesting DCI. After 15 min on oxygen there was 
some improvement and the diver agreed to travel to the car park 
on the bus. The diver remained on oxygen for a further 30 min 
and the symptoms improved and then got worse in waves and so 
an ambulance was called. The diver was taken to hospital by 
ambulance. 
September 2012 12/167 
A group of divers were engaged in a training day with the local 
RNLI.  Four divers entered the water and were covered by their 
RHIB.  The divers dived to the seabed at a depth of about 8m 
and then surfaced after about 9 min.  They then floated at the 
surface to allow two lifeboats to practice a search and rescue

scenario.  All the divers were recovered and returned to the 
larger lifeboat.  Sea conditions were worsening so they moved 
closer to the shore to transfer the divers back to their RHIB.  
During the return journey one of the divers complained of 'pins 
and needles' in his arm and hand and was placed on oxygen.  
The Coastguard was alerted and the diver was airlifted to a 
recompression facility.  It was determined that he was not 
suffering from DCI, but that hyperventilation may have been the 
cause.  No subsequent ill effects were experienced.

Boating & Surface Incidents 
 
 
October 2011 12/239 
Belfast Coastguard received a 999 call reporting persons in the 
water at the entrance to the river Bann. Portrush RNLI all 
weather and inshore lifeboats were tasked, Irish Coastguard 
rescue helicopter 118 scrambled from Sligo and Coleraine 
Coastguard rescue team tasked. Six persons recovered from 
water and upturned vessel by lifeboats. Persons and dive RHIB 
recovered to Portrush Harbour where Coleraine Coastguard 
team met them on arrival. Coastguard helicopter R118 stood 
down.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports).

Liverpool Coastguard was alerted to a broken down dive vessel 
that had suffered gearbox failure, Liverpool immediately tasked 
Douglas IOM lifeboat to assist, the lifeboat towed the stricken 
vessel to shore and safety.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
October 2011 12/242 
Solent Coastguard was alerted to a broken down dive vessel 
with divers in the water and due to ascend in approx 20min, 
there were four divers in the water who had gone down on a 
shotline and were due to come up on DSMB. Solent 
Coastguard tasked Newhaven lifeboat, which arrived on scene 
and recovered the divers, then towed the vessel to Newhaven.  
(Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
November 2011 12/244 
Clyde Coastguard received a 999 call from a diving official that 
a vessel was possibly going to collide with two divers in the 
water off Connell. Clyde Coastguard immediately identified the 
vessel and called the vessel on the radio.  The vessel 
responded but was unable stop before it went over the position 
of the divers. Fearing for the safety of the divers, Clyde 
Coastguard requested the pilot launch to alter course to 
investigate and tasked Oban RNLI lifeboat and Oban 
Coastguard rescue unit. Units arrived on scene quickly and 
located the divers who thankfully were uninjured. This incident 
highlights the need for all divers to show the appropriate 
warnings signals, and that vessels know that there are divers 
under the water.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
November 2011 12/245 
Aberdeen Coastguard received a 999 call reporting a diver 
overdue or missing, at Cove Harbour 3.5 miles south of 
Aberdeen. The diver was found safe and well ashore by other 
divers, no medical attention required.  (Coastguard report). 
November 2011 12/026 
A club boat with seven people onboard, six divers and a non-
diving cox, deployed two pairs of divers in the vicinity of two 
offshore rocks. The two pairs were deployed approximately 5 
min and 30m apart. Both pairs were using fixed SMBs with rigid 
A flags on them. One pair remained approximately in the same 
location as dropped whilst the other pair drifted in the expected 
direction to the east. The wind was steadily increasing but the 
boat managed to keep both SMBs in sight until the first pair 
surfaced and were recovered. The third pair of divers were then 
deployed and, at that point, sight of the second buoy was lost. 
An attempt was made to calculate their anticipated drift pattern 
and the boat moved in that direction but was unable to locate 
the missing SMB and after 10-15 min the Coastguard was 
notified of the missing divers. The Coastguard issued a 
'Mayday' call and tasked two lifeboats and a fixed wing fisheries 
spotter plane along with other craft. The dive boat requested the 
Coastguard use their SARSYS software to calculate the likely 
drift of the divers and requested another boat in the area 
monitor their third pair of divers. The Coastguard provided a 
predicted direction for the first pair's drift.  The dive boat began 
searching in the predicted direction and located the SMB within 
3 min of starting the search. The divers were recovered with no 
ill effects. 
November 2011 12/025 
A pair of divers entered the water from a charter vessel for a 
drift dive using a DSMB as a marker which had been inflated on 
the boat before entering the water. The divers then dived to a 
maximum depth of 22m for a total dive duration of 38 min 
including stops at 12m for 1 min and 6m for 3 min. On surfacing 
the divers could see the charter boat at a distance of around 
half a mile. Sea conditions were rough and the boat was only 
visible from the top of the waves.  The divers waved their DSMB 
and deployed a flag as well. After approximately 20 min the pair 
lost sight of the charter boat. The divers looked towards the 
shore for a suitable point to swim towards and land but the 
shoreline was mostly rocky and unsuitable.  Then they saw a 
strip that looked like a beach and could be suitable to land and 
they started to swim towards it.  After swimming for 
approximately 10 min the divers discovered that they had 
already drifted past the beach. At this point the sea was getting 
rougher and the waves were starting to break behind them. One 
wave was so strong it took the pair underwater and one of the 
divers lost his mask and flag. Both divers had spare masks but 
the diver took 5 to 10 min to settle his breathing down 
sufficiently to fit his spare mask. The pair decided to ride out the 
waves and a short time later spotted a rescue helicopter that 
was apparently searching for them but it was a distance away. 
At one point the helicopter flew near their vicinity but despite 
their waving of the DSMB, arms and signalling with their torches 
they were not spotted. Around 15 min later the divers drifted out 
of a tidal race and the helicopter approached again and this 
time sighted them. A winchman was lowered and advised them 
a lifeboat was on its way and asked if they wanted to await 
recovery by boat. The divers indicated they wanted to be 
recovered by the helicopter and were airlifted, followed by the 
their equipment and returned back to shore. Neither diver 
suffered any ill effects. 
December 2011 12/033 
A pair of divers planned to do a scenic shore-based night dive 
on a shelving site at dusk with clear weather and calm sea. 
They were part of a small group of four divers plus four as shore 
cover. The pair got separated on descent and after a short 
search for the respective buddy, both ascended to the surface 
at normal rates. One of the divers returned immediately to shore 
and on not locating his buddy alerted the shore cover to the fact 
that the other buddy was missing. A dark indistinct object at the 
surface could be seen and was believed to be the missing diver 
but it was too dark to confirm the identity visually and there was 
no light signal reply from this position. The object seemed to be 
drifting away from shore. The dive manager assumed the role of 
rescue manager and delegated getting more torches and the 
oxygen kit closer to the shore. Another dive party was on site 
having their Christmas bonfire and BBQ. This group had many 
more divers entering and exiting the water while enjoying the 
party on shore but they did not seem to have a dive manager 
immediately available who was able to say how many divers the 
other party had in the water. A couple of divers were sent to 
surface swim to the position of the object singled out previously 
and they confirmed that it was the missing diver. The diver had

been searching at the surface for the buddy and had been 
pointing their torch away from shore while being unaware of 
drifting in a slight current. Neither diver suffered any ill effects 
and the manager concluded that next time their small dive party 
would move to a less busy site. 
January 2012 12/034 
Two pairs of divers entered the water for a drift dive on a 
scallop bed and possible wreckage site. The staring point of the 
dive was marked by the dive RHIB as a waypoint on the GPS. 
One pair of divers deployed a DSMB part way through the dive 
to mark the wreckage site and then deployed and ascended a 
second DSMB after 30 min dive time. The other pair had not 
deployed a DSMB by this stage and so a search for them was 
initiated. By this time the tide had turned and had started to run 
NE at 1-2 knots. After several searches down-tide and cross-
tide a squall blew in with driving rain and causing a 1m swell. A 
call was made to the Coastguard for assistance. The 
Coastguard tasked two lifeboats and when they came alongside 
one of the divers transferred to one of the lifeboats with the dive 
slate and starting waypoint to provide information. The dive boat 
remained on station at the starting waypoint whilst the lifeboats 
conducted searches down-tide. The divers were located 
approximately 25 min later 2 miles from the original location. 
The divers were recovered by lifeboat and returned to shore 
whilst the dive boat returned to port. The divers had become 
engrossed in the dive and lost track of time and the distance 
they had travelled. On surfacing under a DSMB they had been 
out of sight of the RHIB. The divers had deployed two DSMBs 
and a flag and had dumped weights to ensure surface 
buoyancy. When the lifeboats came into sight they had used 
torches to attract attention and had been recovered shaken but 
with no ill effects. 
January 2012 12/250 
Clyde Coastguard received a report of a missing diver last seen 
entering the water at 14:45 hours, the diver was wearing a black 
diving suit and had an orange inflatable surface marker. 
Caledonian Macbrayn ferry, Rassay and Tobermory lifeboat 
were tasked to search, also R 100 was tasked, Clyde put out a 
broadcast 'Mayday' for the missing diver, he was found and 
recovered to the helicopter, after examination it was found he 
did not require any medical treatment.  (Coastguard report).

Shetland Coastguard received a report from a dive support 
vessel of a missing diver last seen at 18:00 Local in position 59 
00 N 002 49.49 W. This position is east side of Haco's Ness 
Shapinsay Orkney. The diver was recovered safe.  (Coastguard 
& RNLI reports). 
February 2012 12/252 
Two inshore lifeboats were launched to assist a disabled dive 
boat which was unable to recover its divers.  (Coastguard & 
RNLI reports). 
March 2012 12/055 
A group of nine divers had completed diving from a club RHIB 
with a non-diving coxswain. Shortly after recovering the divers 
the engine began misfiring and became progressively worse 
until the it finally stopped. All possible checks were made and it 
was identified that no fuel was reaching the cylinders. Whilst 
conducting checks the Coastguard was notified.  Once it 
became apparent that it was not possible to fix the engine the 
Coastguard was notified again and they instituted a 'Pan Pan' 
call which was responded to by a small fishing boat. The fishing 
boat took the RHIB under tow and returned them to harbour. 
The fault was found to be due to a fuel pump failure that could 
not have been repaired at sea. The boat engine had been 
regularly professionally serviced from new at designated 
intervals. 
March 2012 12/186 
15 miles offshore in a busy shipping channel a diver was 
spotted in the water by a passing vessel which reported the 
diver to the Coastguard. 20 min afterwards a dive support 
vessel reported a missing diver. The diver had been diving 
alone and had surfaced and been carried away by the tide. Two 
lifeboats and a rescue helicopter were tasked and, 50 min after 
the alert, one of the lifeboats located the diver aided by 
directions provided by a container ship in the area. The diver 
was recovered by the lifeboat and, 10 min later, the lifeboat 
located his dive boat, which was 2 miles away from where the 
diver was recovered. The diver was transferred to the second 
lifeboat for return to harbour and checked over and found to be 
alright. The dive boat was escorted back to harbour and the 
diver was again checked over by paramedics and found to have 
no lasting effects. 
March 2012 12/255 
Solent Coastguard tasked Bembridge RNLI all weather lifeboat 
to a dive RHIB which had suffered engine failure off Bembridge 
Ledge, Isle of Wight, and was unable to recover divers who 
were drifting on the surface. After recovering the divers to the 
lifeboat, the RHIB was towed to her home port of Portsmouth 
harbour where she received safety advice from Portsmouth 
Coastguard rescue officers.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
March 2012 12/256 
Portland Coastguard rescue helicopter 106 was scrambled 
following a report of two divers who had been observed to be 
drifting out to sea west of Portland Bill by Portland Bill 
Coastguard rescue officers who were training on the cliffs at the 
time. The divers were from a local dive boat which had suffered 
a temporary VHF radio failure and had been unable to alert the 
Coastguard. Communications were finally established and the 
Coastguard rescue officers guided the dive boat to the drifting 
divers.  They were recovered to the vessel safe and well. The 
rescue helicopter was stood down.  (Coastguard report).

March 2012 12/187 
A pair of divers were reported missing by a member of the 
public who stated that they had failed to return by the planned 
time. The Coastguard tasked two lifeboats to search and they 
were joined by a fishing vessel that was in the area. As the 
lifeboats began searching the Coastguard was informed that the 
divers had been located ashore safe and well. The search was 
called off and all units stood down. 
March 2012 12/347 
Lifeboat launched to assist divers.  Two persons recovered. 
(RNLI report). 
April 2012 12/258 
A 999 call was received from a member of a sub-aqua group 
reporting three of their divers struggling to get back ashore at 
Thornwick Bay. Bridlington CRT was tasked from exercise 
along with Flamborough ILB. The divers were recovered by the 
ILB and brought back to the boathouse where an ambulance 
was waiting to treat them.  (Coastguard report). 
April 2012 12/260 
Holyhead Coastguard received a call from a member of the 
public reporting seeing a dive boat with three POB aground. 
One person was walking around the boat completely high and 
dry at Fryas Bay, the vessel eventually refloated.  (Coastguard 
report). 
April 2012 12/070 
A group of divers had been deployed in a number of waves 
from two RHIBs. Following the first wave of dives, one of the 
divers switched boats and took over the role of dive manager. 
The group had been using a shotline deployed by a charter boat 
as it had not been safe to deploy their own shotline due to the 
number of divers already on the site. One of the RHIBs had 
recovered all of its divers and returned to harbour. The second 
RHIB remained on station until they recovered four of their 
divers and then returned to harbour forgetting that they still had 
two divers still in the water. The two divers subsequently 
surfaced under a DSMB and could not see their cover boat so 
they inflated their BCDs and waited for recovery. The divers 
were spoken to by another club RHIB in the vicinity asking if 
their boat could be seen and were told that it had departed the 
site. The RHIB went to deploy its own divers on the wreck and 
then returned to check if the divers wanted recovering. They 
declined and opted to stay in the water to await recovery but 
requested that a VHF radio call be made to their boat to return. 
Shortly afterwards a large RHIB was seen coming around the 
headland at speed and the club RHIB signalled it because they 
had drifted quite a distance from the wreck site. The divers were 
recovered after being on the surface for approximately 15 min 
with no ill effects. 
April 2012 12/348 
Lifeboat launched to assist stranded or grounded dive boat.  
(RNLI report). 
April 2012 12/265 
Falmouth Coastguard received a call from a dive boat reporting 
that two divers were overdue by 10 min 0.5 nm south of 
Pendennis Point. Falmouth ALB and Royal Navy helo R-193 
were on exercise in the area and were tasked. R-193 located 
both divers on the surface within 2 min of alert, both well, 
recovered from the water by dive boat.  (Coastguard & RNLI 
reports). 
April 2012 12/267 
Solent Coastguard received a call from a dive support vessel 
which had broken down at the entrance to the Hamble river at 
the south cardinal mark, with six divers onboard, the boat 
suffered engine failure and was drifting, the dive boat anchored. 
The vessel was towed back to port by Hamble lifeboat.  
(Coastguard report). 
May 2012 12/087 
An RHIB was monitoring the progress of a trio of divers when a 
large vessel arrived close by and proceeded to drop its anchor.  
Having dropped the anchor the boat then reversed to lay out the 
anchor chain.  This manoeuvre brought the vessel close to the 
divers.  At this point the divers deployed a DSMB signalling that 
they were about to surface.  One of the divers was then seen at 
the surface by the shot buoy.  Two yachts passed close by and 
the RHIB was positioned to protect the divers.  Those in the 
RHIB then attempted to pull gently on the SMB to guide the 
divers, who were still underwater, away from the large vessel.  
The divers underwater thought that this was the action of 
surface wind and they let out more line.  2 min before the divers 
finally surfaced the large vessel stopped its engines.  All divers 
were safely recovered.  The divers had previously been granted 
permission by the local port authority to dive in the area.  They 
were displaying a large 'A' flag.  No lookouts were seen on the 
large vessel and no radio contact was made. 
May 2012 12/083 
During a boat handling course, on two separate occasions, two 
individuals fell into the water.  In one case the boat hit a wave 
during a fast turn and a passenger fell out.  In the second case, 
again during high speed turns, the trainee cox got the outboard 
tiller stuck behind him and he opened the throttle.  This caused 
him to fall over the transom.  He was wearing a kill cord and the 
boat stopped immediately.  In both cases the individuals were 
recovered without ill effects. 
May 2012 12/275 
A dive RHIB called 'Mayday' after suffering engine failure off the 
Cherry Stones, Mumbles Head with divers still in the water. A 
vessel responded to the 'Mayday' and was on scene in 2 min of 
the 'Mayday' call. The casualty vessel then managed to restart 
its engines and both divers were recovered uninjured and no 
further assistance required.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2012 12/204 
A RHIB with six divers onboard was leaving harbour for a 
second dive of the day when the engine cut out. The symptoms 
were similar to a kill cord having been pulled out. The coxswain 
ran through all standard checks but could not restart the engine. 
An anchor was deployed but before the Coastguard could be 
informed a local charter boat came alongside and offered a tow 
back to harbour. The boat was returned to a service agent who 
identified a blown fuse as the cause of the problem but could 
not identify any underlying reason for the cause of the blown 
fuse. This was the same boat as in incident 12/205. 
May 2012 12/277 
Ministry of Defence police launch Paul Travers went to the aid 
of a dive vessel with twelve persons who had broken down at 
the western end of Plymouth breakwater. The police launch 
took the vessel under tow to commercial wharf Cattedown.  
(Coastguard report).

May 2012 12/103 
A group of divers travelled to a dive site in rough conditions and 
found a sheltered site in the lee of a small island.  The depth 
was about 10m.  Two pairs of divers entered the water 5 min 
apart.  After about 45 min the second pair surfaced using a 
DSMB but there was no sign of the first pair.  The boat party 
started a search for the missing divers, extending their search 
into the rough water area.  When the divers were 30 min 
overdue the Coastguard was alerted.  Two lifeboats, and MOD 
police launch and then a helicopter commenced a search for 
the missing pair.  Within 10 min they were located 1 mile from 
their start point.  The divers were recovered, safe and well, by 
the lifeboat.  The divers had strayed from the lee of the island 
and their DSMB acted as a sail in the strong winds.  They had 
surfaced about 100m from the boat but rough seas, strong 
winds and bright sunlight reflecting from the water had 
prevented them from being seen or heard.  The wind drove 
them further away.  The made themselves buoyant, secured 
themselves together and awaited rescue. 
May 2012 12/279 
Humber Coastguard tasked Hornsea rescue; both Bridlington 
lifeboats were alerted as well as Hornsea Coastguard to a 
report of a vessel that was taking on water off Hornsea. 
Hornsea rescue got alongside the vessel and towed back it into 
Hornsea, where Hornsea Coastguard offered safety advice.  
(Coastguard report). 
May 2012 12/190 
Portland Coastguard received information from a dive vessel in 
a position south east of Portland reporting two divers whose 
SMB had disappeared in the fog. Initial details were taken and 
Weymouth RNLI lifeboat, which was already afloat, was tasked 
but the divers were recovered, safe and well, a few minutes 
later.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2012 12/284 
An all weather lifeboat was launched to assist a broken-down 
boat with divers in the water  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
June 2012 12/189 
The Coastguard was alerted on VHF by a dive boat reporting 
two divers missing whilst conducting a drift dive. The 
Coastguard broadcast a 'Mayday' relay and three lifeboats and 
a helicopter were tasked to search. Another vessel on scene 
located and recovered the divers and they were later 
transferred to one of the lifeboats.  They were assessed by a 
medic from the helicopter who had been winched down to the 
lifeboat.  The divers were taken to hospital where they were 
found to be fit and well. 
June 2012 12/285 
Brixham Coastguard received a call from a dive support vessel 
reporting an overdue diver. The diver was located by another 
dive vessel and recovered safe and well.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2012 12/205 
A dive RHIB with seven divers and a coxswain onboard was 
travelling out to a dive site. After a journey time of 30 min the 
engine cut out and would not restart. The Coxswain called the 
Coastguard and the RHIB was met by a fire and rescue boat, 
which happened to be in the area, and towed back to harbour. 
The group had a second boat available and so diving was able 
to continue.  The boat was returned to the dealer and after an 
exhaustive investigation a 0.5 mm wire in the wiring loom was 
found to have shorted to the engine casing. This was the same 
boat as in incident 12/204. 
June 2012 12/150 
Two divers conducted a 19m dive for a duration of 37 min with a 
1 min stop at 6m.  On surfacing they were surprised to see that 
their boat was much further away than expected.  The divers 
had been carried away by a current.  They waved an inflated 
DSMB and shouted but, due to the sea conditions, they were 
not seen nor heard.  The boat party realised that they were 
missing, conducted a brief search and then alerted the 
Coastguard.  Three lifeboats and a helicopter were tasked to 
search and the divers were found quite quickly, by the 
helicopter, about 2.5 km from their starting point.  The divers 
were recovered by a lifeboat and taken ashore.  They were met 
by an ambulance crew.  The divers exhibited no adverse effects 
and no further action was required. 
June 2012 12/349 
Lifeboat launched to assist stranded or grounded dive boat.  
(RNLI report). 
June 2012 12/098 
A newly purchased dive boat was taken on a trip to check its 
seaworthiness.  During this trip the steering failed.  The boat 
was anchored and the failure investigated.  The crew concluded 
that they could not solve the problem at sea and they alerted 
the Coastguard.  A nearby dive boat heard the radio call and 
offered help.  The dive boat towed them back to the harbour.  
Subsequent examination revealed damaged steering gear and 
cable which had to be replaced.  This boat had been recently 
refurbished and serviced. 
June 2012 12/095 
A group of divers planned a dive down the side of an isolated 
rock.  The sea conditions were rough and they positioned 
themselves in the lee of the rock.  Two divers descended to a 
maximum depth of 21m.  They found themselves in a strong 
current that was running in the opposite direction to that 
expected.  They tried swimming against it for a while and then 
turned and went with the current.  They remained at 18m for a 
while, but became concerned that they were being carried away 
from the planned dive site.  They struggled against the current 
and used ropes on the seabed to pull themselves along.  After 
28 min, at a depth of 12m they decided to finish the dive.  They 
deployed a DSMB and started their ascent.  They were carried 
upwards; one diver was able to stop at 5m the other was carried 
to the surface.  The diver who had surfaced re-descended and 
they completed a 4 min safety stop.  Once at the surface they 
spotted a fishing buoy close by and attempted to swim to it.  
They were unable to make way against the current and they 
stopped trying.  They secured themselves together and ditched 
their weightbelts.  They attempted to attract the attention of their 
boat but were not seen.  The boat party realised that the two 
were missing and alerted the Coastguard.   A search was 
initiated involving a helicopter, four lifeboats and other local 
craft.  The divers were located by one of the lifeboats after 2 
hours, 1.5 miles from the rock.  They were taken by ambulance 
to hospital but neither experienced any ill effects. 
June 2012 12/096 
A group of divers were engaged in a training event.  One of the 
attending RHIBs heard a 'Pan Pan' relay message concerning a 
disabled pleasure cruiser in their vicinity.  The RHIB's crew 
arranged for other boats to tend their divers and they went to 
assist.  They discovered that the boat was being blown ashore 
and in imminent danger of hitting rocks.  They took the boat in 
tow and moved it to safe water.  Heavy radio traffic hindered 
their attempts to inform the Coastguard of their actions.  A 
lifeboat arrived and took over the rescue.  In their rush to assist 
the RHIB party forgot to lower their 'A' flag and this caused

Solent Coastguard received a call from a dive support vessel 
that had lost both engines and had divers in the water, the 
vessel was drifting away from the shotline, with two divers still in 
the water. Solent CG put out a broadcast and tasked R-104, 
Littlestone lifeboat, and Rye Aby ILB.  Also Lide range control 
boat responding & a dive boat. The divers were recovered and 
the vessel was towed to shore.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports).

support anchored just off the south of the Beagle with engine 
failure, no divers in the water, safe and well but require tow, 
Largs lifeboat was tasked and towed the stricken craft to 
harbour.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
July 2012 12/131 
Two divers conducted a dive on a wreck at a depth of 29m.  
Underwater visibility was low and one of the pair attached a 
distance line to the anchor.  The divers swam off the wreck onto 
the seabed.  After about 15 min the diver who was not carrying 
the distance line lost sight of his buddy and the line.  He quickly 
searched the local area but was unable to relocate his buddy.  
He deployed his DSMB and made a normal ascent including a 
safety stop at 6m.  The other diver made his way back to the 
anchor, using his distance line.  He then ascended the anchor 
line, making a normal ascent.  Once back in the boat he alerted 
the party to the separation.  The DSMB of the other diver had 
not been noticed by the surface party.  Surface conditions were 
poor making it difficult to spot the missing diver.  Eventually he 
was seen about 400m away.  The boat moved to him and he 
was safely recovered; exhausted but otherwise well.

Yarmouth Coastguard tasked Lowestoft lifeboat to investigate a 
report of a dive boat in difficulties; the dive boat sank east of 
Littlehampton with one person onboard; the remaining eleven 
were in the water. The dive boat was recovered from the water 
by the Vos Earl and taken to Lowestoft. The person remaining 
onboard the vessel was checked out in hospital for any ill 
effects.  There was a small amount of pollution.  (Coastguard 
report). 
July 2012 12/210 
A lifeboat was returning to station following a training exercise 
when they saw a diving boat beginning to sink, half a mile from 
harbour. The boat had eleven people onboard and was seen to 
be down at the stern and people onboard were bailing. As the 
boat sank three people onboard were trapped in the 
wheelhouse and their faces could be seen in the glass. The 
people in the wheelhouse managed to escape by swimming 
down and out through an open window. The lifeboat recovered 
all eleven people from the water and returned them to harbour. 
All had been dressed in undersuits only and none had time to 
don lifejackets before the boat sank. Four of the crew were 
taken to hospital to be treated for ingestion of diesel fuel and 
shock. The boat remained floating with the bow above water

A dive RHIB had six divers in the water. Two minutes before the 
divers were due to surface the RHIB propeller became 
entangled in a submerged pot line and the coxswain was 
unable to free it.  Two pairs of divers surfaced but began to drift 
away from the RHIB. The coxswain called the Coastguard for 
assistance and the Coastguard tasked a lifeboat. Before the 
lifeboat arrived the final pair of divers surfaced approximately 
20m away from the boat but rapidly drifted away. The coxswain 
threw a rope to one of the divers and he was pulled towards the 
boat whilst finning in. The diver managed to free the prop within 
the water. The RHIB was then able to recover the divers as the 
lifeboat arrived.

Portland Coastguard tasked Swanage RNLI lifeboat to a dive 
vessel which was taking water in a position about 6.5 nm south 
of Christchurch Harbour entrance. There was one person 
onboard and seven divers in the water who were recovered by 
two other vessels. The boat was accompanied into Poole 
harbour where it was lifted out of the water and found to have 
sustained considerable damage to the hull somehow.  
(Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
 
August 2012 12/139 
A group of divers were diving on a wreck which was 100m from 
the shore.  They were diving from a boat and had secured the 
boat to a visible part of the wreck.  They put two pairs of divers 
into the water.  They then noticed other divers swimming, on the 
surface, towards the wreck from the shore.  There was a current 
running and these divers were being carried down-current.  The 
boat moved to these divers to check that they were alright; they 
said they were.  At this point one pair of the boat's divers 
became separated and they both surfaced.  The boat moved 
back to pick them up.  Having recovered their divers the boat 
party noticed that a third pair of shore divers seemed to be in 
difficulties.  One of these divers shouted for help and the boat 
moved towards them.  They took hold of the troubled diver and 
he calmed down.  They helped these divers to remove their kit 
and then got them into the boat.  The panicked diver had lost a 
fin; his buddy said he felt sick.  The boat's second pair of divers 
then surfaced on the shotline.  This pair agreed to wait while the 
boat returned the troubled divers to the shore; two of the boat 
party assisted them ashore.  On their return to the wreck they 
found another shore diver at the surface; he had lost his buddy.  
The buddy had remained underwater and swum ashore.  Once 
the buddy was spotted ashore the lone diver also swam back to 
the beach.

Humber Coastguard tasked Cullercoats lifeboat, Tynemouth 
lifeboats and Tynemouth volunteer life brigade, rescue R-131 
and Longsands lifeguards to a report of a diver missing at 
Longsands. Broadcast action was initiated, information was 
gained that the swimmer was ashore and reunited with the 
other party of five divers.  (Coastguard report).

Lifeboat launched to assist dive boat with engine problems.  
(RNLI report). 
August 2012 12/317 
A group of divers had been conducting a shore dive when one 
of the group was caught out by a strong current and taken out 
to sea. The alarm was raised and a lifeboat was launched and 
proceeded towards the scene. Resources tasked, D99 police 
launch, Dover harbour launch, Dover AWLB. The diver was 
located, before the lifeboat arrived, by a harbour board patrol 
boat, which returned the diver to the RNLI station. The other 
divers in the group returned to the beach safely. 
August 2012 12/322 
Brixham Coastguard was contacted by a dive boat reporting two 
divers missing; the divers were found by a passing yacht and 
reunited with their parent vessel safe and well.  (Coastguard 
report). 
September 2012 12/170 
The Coastguard was alerted when two divers became overdue.  
Three lifeboats and a helicopter were tasked to search and 
other vessels, including a warship, assisted.  The divers fired 
two flares which were seen by one of the assisting vessels and 
this allowed the search area to be narrowed.  The divers were 
safely recovered into their own boat.  No subsequent ill effects 
were reported. 
September 2012 12/199 
A group of six divers were dropped on an offshore rock by a 
dive boat with the intention of making their own way back to 
shore after a 90 min dive. Underwater visibility was poor and 
some of the divers became separated. Three divers surfaced at

the end of their dive intending to swim to shore on the surface. 
Conditions were choppy and they were being carried further 
out. One diver did not have a snorkel and used his regulator 
until he ran out of gas and then started to panic. He was spotted 
from the shore by members of the public who raised the alarm 
with the Coastguard.  A teenage boy paddled out to the diver in 
his kayak and assisted him back to the shore. The other two 
divers decided to descend and swim back to the shore 
underwater.  The Coastguard initiated a search for the 
remaining divers involving an inshore lifeboat, Coastguard 
teams, police and ambulance teams and an inflatable from a 
warship. All the remaining divers returned to shore without 
incident. The last diver to return surfaced with a large haul of 
fish in tow and was surprised by all the attention. 
September 2012 12/336 
Aberdeen Coastguard was contacted by a dive boat with four 
POB, they reported on channel 16 to Aberdeen MRCC no 
power off Rosehearty harbour. A nearby creel vessel towed the 
vessel into Rosehearty harbour where they were met by 
Fraserburgh Coastguard team.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2012 12/339 
Swansea Coastguard tasked Porthcawl inshore lifeboat, 
Mumbles all weather lifeboat and RAF rescue helicopter R-169 
to a dive vessel with two POB reporting that it was taking water 
just south of the Scar Weather sand bank and required 
immediate assistance. SAR units arriving on scene accounted 
for all crew and water ingress was controlled by the use of 
pumps before Mumbles lifeboat towed the vessel back to 
Swansea marina. Mumbles Coastguard rescue team were also 
in attendance.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2012 12/376 
Three divers surfaced after an uneventful dive and signalled 
their boat which was picking up other divers.  While waiting for 
pick up they saw a speedboat approaching them very quickly.  
They signalled to the speedboat but it continued to approach.  
The dive boat, having recovered the other divers, was able to 
position itself between the speedboat and three divers in the 
water and it sounded its horn.  At a distance of only 50m from 
the divers, the speedboat turned away and slowed.  Those on 
the dive boat shouted to the speedboat driver to make him 
aware of the situation.  The divers were recovered unharmed. 
September 2012 12/340 
Dive RHIB suffered grounding with six divers aboard, the vessel 
suffered propeller damage. Clyde Coastguard kept a 
communications schedule with the vessel as it made slow 
progress back to harbour.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2012 12/175 
A dive RHIB had been left on a mooring in a sheltered bay. The 
weather forecast was for winds to increase overnight from the 
SE and the mooring was protected from the SE by a natural 
barrier of a rocky reef. The RHIB was secured to two moorings 
via three painter lines from two independent strong points on 
the boat. During the following morning the weather worsened 
and around midday a large swell was observed breaking over 
the rocky reef. The vessel was still riding well on the mooring 
but was beginning to take on some water over the transom and 
side tubes. As the winds increased the vessel started to be hit 
broadside by the waves and one of the bow lines appeared to 
fail. A decision was made to deploy a swimmer to swim out to 
the boat and either secure another line to the vessel or board 
the boat and move it to harbour 8-10 miles away. The swimmer 
tried to reach the boat which was now being hit by large waves 
but he was unable to reach the boat and was washed back into 
the surf and was subsequently being dashed onto rocks. The 
shore party called 999 and an emergency call to the 
Coastguard was made. A rescue helicopter, cliff rescue team 
and lifeboat were all tasked to assist. The swimmer was 
rescued by the helicopter crew and landed nearby. Shortly 
afterwards the RHIB was seen to be struck by four consecutive 
very large waves, turned broadside, inverted and it broke away 
from its moorings and was subsequently smashed onto rocks. 
Approximately 2 hours later the sea state subsided and a shore 
party started to make an attempt to recover any wreckage. The 
RHIB tubes were recovered and small parts of the seat and 
bottle rack were located and recovered the following day. 
Extensive underwater and shoreline searches failed to recover 
any further wreckage.

Ascent Incidents 
 
 
October 2011 12/084 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 35m.  At a 
depth of 20m she started a rapid feet first ascent to the surface.  
At the surface she lost her regulator and swallowed some 
water.  She was recovered into the boat and given oxygen.  She 
was then taken to a recompression facility where she was kept 
under observation for a brief period before being discharged. 
October 2011 12/005 
On the first dive of a week long trip a diver had descended to a 
maximum depth of 26m using nitrox 32 for a no stop dive 
monitored by a dive computer set to 32% nitrox. After 
approximately 47 min the diver and his buddy started an ascent 
up the side of the wreck to approximately 20m. The diver's 
buddy started to deploy a DSMB but the diver found he was 
unable to hold his depth and began ascending towards the 
surface. The diver tried to grab hold of the wreck to prevent his 
ascent but was unable to and made a slow ascent to the 
surface in 2 - 3 min but was unable to conduct any safety stops. 
His buddy was unable to assist in controlling his ascent.  The 
buddy made a normal ascent including safety stops.  On 
surfacing the diver signalled the charter boat that he was OK 
but was not picked up until after his buddy had surfaced.  On 
recovery into the boat the diver reported what had happened.  
He was assisted out of his drysuit and taken into the 
wheelhouse. The diver was given oxygen and fluids and the 
emergency services were informed. The diver was returned to 
shore and taken by ambulance to a recompression facility 
where he was placed on oxygen for 4 hours but not 
recompressed. No symptoms of DCI where identified and the 
diver was released.  He was advised not to dive the next day 
and to monitor himself for symptoms that may present 
themselves. No symptoms were apparent and the diver 
returned to diving two days after the incident and dived the 
remainder of the week without incident.  On checking his 
equipment the diver found that his weightbelt was 2 kg under 
the required amount. 
October 2011 12/018 
Following a dive at an inland site to 7m for 49 min, three divers 
entered the water again after a surface interval of 92 min. The 
divers had planned to conduct a further buoyancy check at 7m 
but because they had not altered their equipment they decided 
not to bother. The three spent around 10 min between 7 and 
10m and then descended to 22m.  They swam to an underwater 
feature and took some photographs before moving on to 
another feature and taking some more shots. One diver in the 
group signalled that he had only 50 bar remaining whilst the 
other two had 120 bar remaining. The group stayed close and 
looked for the shotline which they knew was nearby. Shortly 
after the third diver had virtually no air left and so the group 
abandoned their search and made a normal ascent to 5m for 
their safety stop. Around 7m during the ascent the second and 
third divers started to descend again and dropped below the 
first diver. She became confused by the exhaust bubbles of the 
others and made a fast ascent to the surface. On the surface 
she inflated her BCD and monitored the other divers. The other 
two divers were seen to ascend and descend a number of times 
between 8 and 4m. The diver on the surface decided to 
descend and assisted them to the surface. The second diver 
orally inflated the third diver's BCD and then all three rested for 
a minute before making their way back to shore. The third diver 
was found to have a nose bleed and a cut on the bridge of his 
nose. The second diver experienced no problems and the first 
diver felt 'a little achy' and contacted a diver helpline.  The third 
diver began to feel dizzy and was advised to contact a local 
chamber. 
October 2011 12/243 
Liverpool Coastguard was informed of a female diver having 
made a rapid ascent from 10m, not missed any decompression 
stops, suffering no other symptoms except a nose bleed, she 
was being treated for shock and was on oxygen,  no need for 
ambulance she says she is fine, will refuse medical assistance, 
the boat will keep treating her.  (Coastguard report). 
November 2011 12/248 
Holyhead Coastguard was alerted to a diver who had made a 
rapid ascent from 3m, the diver had inadvertently used his pony 
cylinder rather than his main cylinder, when this smaller cylinder 
became empty he panicked and finned to the surface without 
breathing out. The dive vessel was met by an ambulance and 
the diver was taken to Ysbtyty Gwynedd for treatment. 
Murrayfield chamber were in contact with the hospital.  
(Coastguard report). 
February 2012 12/038 
A trainee diver and her buddy were conducting the final dive for 
their entry level qualification under the supervision of an 
instructor. The group descended a shotline to a wreck at a 
maximum depth of 17m. The diver's ears took some time to 
clear and she held onto the shotline during descent and did not 
adjust her buoyancy as she was concentrating on clearing her 
ears. Once down the diver adjusted her buoyancy and 
proceeded with the dive. At times the diver lost some control of 
her buoyancy and used her hands to try to compensate before 
realising and adjusting her buoyancy again. After approximately 
20 min the pair checked each others gas contents and signalled 
their agreement to ascend. At this point the diver was swimming 
down slightly to try and hold station with her buddy, allowing her 
legs to rise. The diver appeared to realise she was becoming 
positively buoyant but was slow to react and as she was now 
horizontal could not dump gas effectively from her drysuit. The 
diver started to ascend and the instructor grabbed hold of her 
fins to slow the ascent and to allow control to be regained after 
rising 3-4m from 12m. The pair descended back to 12m and 
regained control and checked gauges again. The group then 
ascended normally to 6m and a safety stop was signalled. 
Although the diver signalled back to agree to this she was seen 
to slowly drift up to the surface without stopping. The instructor 
and the other student made a normal ascent omitting safety 
stops.  At the surface they assisted the buoyant diver who was 
struggling on the surface because a fin had become dislodged. 
The fin was recovered, refitted and the group was recovered to 
the cover boat. 
February 2012 12/045 
An instructor and student were exploring some wreckage at a 
depth of 20m 6 min into a dive. There was some confusion that 
led to a fast ascent by both student and instructor. On surfacing 
the pair were seen by the staff on site.  Both declined oxygen. 
No injuries were indentified although both were apparently 
shocked. 
February 2012 12/047 
A pair of divers had conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 
36m. On returning to a depth of 20m, after 25 min, one of the 
divers experienced a free flow from his regulator resulting in a 
fast ascent to the surface. Oxygen first aid was offered but 
declined by both divers.

March 2012 12/142 
Six divers using air were at a depth of 31m when one of their 
regulators began to free flow.  The diver took the octopus 
regulator of one of the other divers and this also began to free 
flow.  They made a fast ascent to the surface.  Their dive 
duration was 16 min.  The other divers surfaced safely.  Oxygen 
was declined and no ill effects were reported. 
March 2012 12/363 
During the first open water dive of a drysuit course, at a depth 
of 13m, the casualty experienced an inversion, rose to the 
surface and lost her regulator in the process. She was assisted 
out of the water by three experienced divers who were present 
in the area and administered oxygen. A doctor present 
immediately examined her and an ambulance took her to a 
recompression chamber. Tests concluded that she did not 
require treatment. 
March 2012 12/054 
A diver was diving on a wreck at a depth of 32m. This was the 
diver's first sea dive of the year but he was reported to have 
dived in freshwater quarries during the winter. The diver was 
using an open circuit system and he also carried a 7 lt steel 
stage cylinder with nitrox for accelerated decompression. 
During the dive the decompression stage became detached 
and the diver did not notice.  The cylinder was subsequently 
collected by another member of the group, not the diver's 
buddy. Once the diver started to ascend he was unable to 
control his buoyancy due to the loss of the steel cylinder and he 
made an uncontrolled ascent direct to the surface. The diver 
was recovered onto the charter boat by tail lift.  He complained 
of tingling in his hands and arms. The diver was given oxygen 
and the Coastguard called.  It was decided to take the diver 
back to shore for transfer to hospital by ambulance. Another 
RHIB in the area stood by to collect the remaining two 
rebreather divers. The diver was transferred to a recompression 
facility to be checked over but was found to be suffering from 
shock but otherwise alright and no recompression treatment 
was required. 
March 2012 12/364 
On the third dive of a deep diving course and first dive of the 
day. As the group were ascending from 40m, the casualty lost 
control of the ascent and went up rapidly. Surface cover helped 
him exit the water, and to remove his BCD and drysuit. He was 
pale and shaking and mentioned the loss of his weightbelt at 
20m.  He had made a rapid ascent so he was put on 
emergency oxygen. The instructor surfaced after his safety 
stop, then helped surface cover with rescue. The casualty was 
then transported to a hyperbaric chamber. 
March 2012 12/053 
An instructor and a student with a third diver entered the water 
to practise a controlled buoyant lift on the first dive of the day. 
Visibility in the surface layer was poor due to rain runoff. 
Following a short surface swim a datum line was deployed and 
the three started to descend. Due to a slight current the third 
diver drifted away from the shotline in the poor visibility at a 
depth of around 2m. The student continued his descent to the 
seabed without waiting for the instructor. The instructor had 
resurfaced following the separation and could clearly see the 
bubbles of the third diver moving away from the shotline at 
about 20m distance and then turned, moving back towards the 
shotline. The instructor tugged on the shotline and the student 
ascended and reported he had been waiting at a depth of 7m. 
After a further 2 min the third diver surfaced and reported that 
he had been to a maximum of 15m depth and that the visibility 
was clearer down there. The group re-descended and settled 
on the bottom at a depth of 16m. The third diver then acted as a 
simulated casualty as planned for the controlled buoyant lift and 
the student began a rescue.  After ascending 3-4m off the 
seabed the student was unable to control the ascent as he was 
unable to dump gas quickly enough. At a depth of 11m the 
instructor noticed the ascent was too fast and managed to grab 
hold of the student's fin at around 8m to try and control the 
ascent but it was too late and the student and third diver made 
a fast ascent direct to the surface. The instructor managed to 
slow his own ascent slightly but still made a faster than normal 
ascent. On surfacing the instructor requested the shore party to 
prepare the oxygen, whilst a standby diver swam out and 
assisted the student and third diver back to shore. The student 
and third diver were placed on oxygen and the instructor 
continued to breathe from his nitrox 37 for 5 min. No ill effects 
were experienced and the three divers refrained from diving for 
the rest of the day. 
March 2012 12/121 
Two divers descended a shotline to a wreck in a maximum 
depth of 30m.  The dive leader reached the deck of the wreck at 
a depth of 24m and saw the other diver above him.  He thought 
that this diver might be experiencing buoyancy problems and he 
took hold of the shotline and ascended to take hold of the other 
diver.  He turned to grasp the other diver but she was nowhere 
to be seen.  He looked around for her and then made a normal 
ascent.  The other diver was inexperienced in drysuit use and 
reported that the dump on her drysuit was obscured by her 
BCD.  She was an experienced diver but with limited 
experience of UK diving.  She struggled to control her 
buoyancy, became inverted and made a buoyant ascent to the 
surface.  Once at the surface she was recovered by another 
boat.  She was placed on oxygen, the Coastguard was alerted 
and the diver was airlifted to a recompression facility where she 
received precautionary recompression treatment.  She was 
asymptomatic throughout. 
March 2012 12/060 
A diver and his buddy were preparing to dive when his buddy 
noticed that the diver did not have a drysuit inflator fitted. The 
diver de-kitted, fitted a hose and then kitted up again. The diver 
had hurried and had become a little hot and flustered. After 
allowing him a minute or so to calm down the pair entered the 
water and after a further couple of minutes on the surface they 
descended to a maximum depth of 11m. Part-way though the 
dive the buddy noticed that the diver's alternate source was 
leaking and indicated this to the diver who sorted it out. The pair 
then headed back towards their starting point. At this point the 
diver was down to 70 bar and so began to deploy a DSMB. On 
deploying, the DSMB pulled the diver up a couple of metres and 
his buddy grabbed him and pulled him back down from around 
7m. The diver had let go of his DSMB and so the buddy 
deployed his. The pair had no mandatory stops to do but 
paused at 6m to conduct safety stops. The buddy's computer 
was jumping between 6 to 3m even though he wasn't moving. 
The diver suddenly shot up to the surface from a depth of 4-5m. 
On recovery to the boat the diver was placed on oxygen as he 
was complaining of tingling to the face and lips. After 20 min on 
oxygen the tingling had ceased. 
April 2012 12/063 
Following two dives the previous day a diver conducted a dive 
using nitrox 32 on a wreck at a maximum depth of 18m.  17 min 
into the dive she started to experience 'floaty feet' due to gas in 
her drysuit boots. The diver ascended to 15m before she could 
regain control. At this point she could not locate her buddy and 
so started to ascend.  Her feet again became buoyant and, 
whilst attempting to get the air out of her boots and dump air 
from her BCD, she lost control and made a fast ascent to the 
surface. The diver signalled the cover RHIB and was picked up 
and placed on oxygen straight away. Her buddy was

?BSAC - 2012   37 
subsequently recovered. Two other divers on the boat had also 
had a fast ascent (Incident no. 12/064) and so the oxygen 
equipment was being shared between the three divers who 
were breathing from it for one minute each whilst waiting for the 
remaining divers to surface. As the oxygen began to run low the 
skipper contacted a charter boat in the area which provided an 
additional oxygen set which the three divers then shared 
between them. On returning to shore the diver was placed on 
oxygen from her own club. The Coastguard had been contacted 
and a helicopter was tasked to airlift the three divers to a 
recompression chamber. At the recompression chamber the 
diver was monitored but no symptoms of DCI developed and 
the diver was released and advised not to dive for 24 hours. 
April 2012 12/081 
Two divers descended a shotline to a depth of 16m and then 
followed the seabed down to 27m.  At this point, one of the 
divers indicated that he was becoming buoyant.  His buddy 
indicated that they should ascend using a DSMB.  The buoyant 
diver then started an uncontrolled ascent.  Despite his efforts to 
prevent it, he was carried to the surface.  He suffered no 
immediate ill effects but, about five days later, he went to his 
doctor with ear problems.  He was referred to his local hospital 
and they diagnosed nerve damage due to barotrauma.  He 
attended a recompression facility for further tests.  The final 
conclusion was that the ear problem was not diving related. 
April 2012 12/262 
A diver made a rapid ascent from max depth of 25m.  The diver 
ascended 25 to 9m uncontrolled, went back to 22m then lost 
control again, the diver felt dizzy, nauseous and lightheaded, 
was not given oxygen. The dive vessel was met by a paramedic 
and the casualty taken to hospital. 
May 2012 12/076 
A pair of divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 26m. 
Towards the end of the dive one of the divers deployed his 
DSMB without tying off the reel and was immediately too 
buoyant. The diver struggled to press the catch to release the 
DSMB.  His buddy grabbed his BCD to try and pull him back 
down but lost his grip after being pulled up as well. The buoyant 
diver dumped all the air from his BCD but was unable to 
operate his drysuit shoulder dump and so pulled open his neck 
seal to perform an emergency dump but by this time he had 
surfaced. His buddy surfaced beside him having forgotten to 
dump the gas from his BCD. Neither diver suffered any ill 
effects but decided not to conduct a second dive. 
May 2012 12/086 
Three divers entered the water and descended to the seabed at 
a depth of 10m.  They set off following a compass heading.  
The dive leader checked on a number of occasions to ensure 
that they stayed together.  Shortly into the dive the dive leader 
became separated from the others when they encountered a 
current.  The dive leader prepared her DSMB.  In the process 
her regulator began to free flow and she could not stop it.  She 
made a quick ascent to the surface breathing from the free 
flowing regulator.  At the surface she met up with the other two 
divers.  Her 12 lt cylinder was down to 20 bar.  The diver was 
safely recovered from the water and the other two continued 
their dive.  The regulator had been serviced very recently. 
May 2012 12/177 
Following two dives without incident the previous day, two 
divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 15m for a 
duration of 27 min with one diver using nitrox 32 and the other 
using air. At a depth of 14m, nearing the end of the dive, the 
nitrox diver indicated that she had a problem with her regulator 
and required assistance. The diver had bitten through her 
mouthpiece during the dive and it was allowing water to enter 
her mouth. Her buddy donated his alternate source and the 
diver purged it before putting it in her mouth but was concerned 
by the bubbles and thought there was something wrong with it. 
As a consequence she replaced her own regulator back into her 
mouth but continued to get water, started to panic, took the 
regulator from her buddy's mouth and started to ascend quickly 
to the surface. Her buddy saw the diver's own alternate source 
dangling and took this to replace his own lost regulator. The 
pair ascended quickly to the surface although not excessive 
because the buddy had dumped his buoyancy at the start of the 
incident. The buddy also noticed that the diver's mask was 
flooded. On recovery into the boat both divers were placed on 
oxygen and the emergency services were called by the charter 
boat skipper. The boat returned to harbour to be met by an 
ambulance that took both divers to a recompression chamber 
where they were assessed but found not to be displaying any 
symptoms of DCI.  Both were discharged without treatment. 
May 2012 12/080 
An instructor and a trainee were conducting mask clearing 
training at a depth of 5m.  Suddenly the trainee panicked, pulled 
her mask off and took the regulator out of her month.  In the 
process she dislodged the instructor's mask a little.  The 
instructor offered his alternative source and attempted to adjust 
his mask.  The trainee had her eyes shut and rushed towards 
the surface.  The instructor went with her and continued to offer 
his regulator, which was refused.  At the surface the trainee was 
distressed, but breathing normally and able to speak.  The 
instructor signalled distress and towed the trainee to the shore.  
The trainee recovered with no subsequent ill effects. 
May 2012 12/274 
Shetland Coastguard received a call from a dive support vessel 
reporting they had a diver aboard who had missed stops. The 
diver showed no sign of symptoms; a diving doctor was 
requested to meet the vessel when it arrived in harbour. 
Shetland CG arranged an ambulance and doctor to meet them. 
The diver had made a rapid ascent from 18m and missed 4 min 
of decompression stops. The diver was taken to hospital in 
Stromness.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2012 12/089 
An instructor and two trainees dived to a maximum depth of 
20m.  After 15 min they returned to a depth of 15m and 
conducted mask and regulator clearing drills.  They then 
conducted alternative source ascents from 10m to 6m.  During 
this practice one of the trainees descended too quickly and 
experienced pain in his ears.  They separated and the other 
trainee, who had been receiving air, put his own main regulator 
back into his mouth.  However, when he tried to breathe from it 
he just got water.  He took the regulator from his mouth and 
made a rapid ascent from 8m to the surface, swallowing water 
on the way.  At the surface he shouted for help.  The instructor 
surfaced soon after and guided the troubled diver to a buoy to 
hold on to.  Two other divers entered the water to swim to their 
assistance and the other trainee towed the troubled diver to the 
shore.  The diver was placed on oxygen and an ambulance was 
called.  The other trainee stated that he too had made a rapid 
ascent.  Both were taken to hospital for examination.  No 
adverse effects were experienced and both were discharged 
that evening.   It was found that the diver who had suffered the 
initial problem had no air left in his cylinder. 
May 2012 12/276 
Portland Coastguard tasked Coastguard rescue helicopter R-
106 to airlift a diver from a dive support boat following a rapid 
ascent.  Three other divers from dive boat should have surfaced 
20 min ago while dive boat was off dive position - the diver's

position was initially unknown. All three were recovered safely.  
(Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
May 2012 12/144 
Two divers were at a depth of 22m when one of them suffered a 
panic attack and made a fast ascent to the surface.  His dive 
duration was 12 min.  He felt that he couldn't gain buoyancy in 
his drysuit and was struggling to breathe.  He was placed on 
oxygen and given fluids to drink.  No symptoms were apparent 
and no further action was taken.

A pair of divers were decompressing on a shotline after a dive 
to a maximum depth of 32m.  One of the pair then surfaced 
rapidly and arrived at the surface with his computer sounding an 
alarm.  He had missed 7 min of a 10 min stop at 6m.  The 
conditions were calm and the dive manager sent the diver back 
down to complete his stops.  Once back in the boat he was 
placed on oxygen for 30 min and given fluids.  He was 
monitored for symptoms but none were found.  The diver 
reported that he had been concerned that he was running out of 
air.  The diver was know to become 'anxious and flustered' in 
stressful situations. 
May 2012 12/099 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 23m.  During 
the ascent, at a depth of 10m, the cuff dump on his drysuit 
jammed closed.  The diver made a rapid ascent to the surface.  
His total dive duration was 30 min.  No subsequent ill effects 
were reported. 
June 2012 12/282 
Brixham Coastguard was contacted by the beach master at 
Livermead beach who reported one female shore diver had 
surfaced in a panic. Two others in the party remained 
unaccounted for. It was established the female diver had 
ingested water and surfaced quickly, panicked but was 
otherwise unharmed. Two other divers surfaced safely on 
completion of the dive. FAGI.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2012 12/097 
Two divers entered the water and started their descent.  One 
diver was under-weighted and his buddy returned to the boat for 
an extra 2 kg weight which the diver put in his BCD pocket.  
They dived to a maximum depth of 26m and then made their 
ascent.  At about 15m, during their ascent, they both deployed 
DSMBs.  At this point the diver who had been under-weighted 
lost control of his buoyancy and was carried directly to the 
surface.  His buddy watched from below as the diver was 
recovered into the boat.  The buddy made a normal ascent with 
a 3 min safety stop.  The diver who had made the rapid ascent 
was monitored for the rest of the day.  No symptoms were 
apparent.  It was subsequently found that the diver thought that 
he had put the extra weight in an inner BCD pocket when in fact 
it had been in an outer pocket.  When he deployed his DSMB 
the weight was dislodged and fell away; this resulted in the 
uncontrolled ascent.  The diver suffered no subsequent ill 
effects. 
July 2012 12/133 
A pair of divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 28m.  
During the descent one of the pair noticed that he had air in the 
legs of his drysuit and this made it harder for him to get down.  
Their ascent went to plan until they reached 6m.  At this point 
the diver who had had buoyancy problems lost control of his 
buoyancy and was carried to the surface missing stops.  His 
buddy was unable to stop him.  The Coastguard was alerted 
and the diver was airlifted to a recompression facility for 
treatment.  No symptoms of DCI were reported. 
July 2012 12/303 
Falmouth Coastguard received a 999 call from a dive boat 
stating that one of their divers had made a rapid ascent from 
22.4m from the wreck of the ALICE just off Penzance harbour. 
The vessel was connected to DDRC doctor who recommended 
evacuation to the hyperbaric unit. Rescue helicopter R-193 was 
tasked and carried out the evacuation. The dive boat was met 
by Penzance Coastguard team on arrival back at Penzance and 
safety advice passed.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2012 12/310 
Shetland Coastguard tasked an ambulance to take two divers 
who had missed stops to Stromness chamber;  there were no 
ambulances or taxies available so they were taken by a private 
vehicle, the divers were treated at Stromness.  (Coastguard 
report). 
August 2012 12/148 
A diver conducted a series of dives over a number of days.  The 
day before the incident he dived to 21m for 57 min with a 3 min 
stop at 5m.  Then, after a surface interval of 2 hours 43 min, he 
dived to 21m for 56 min with a 3 min stop at 5m.  The following 
day he dived, with his buddy, to a depth of 19m.  His BCD strap 
was loose and, as he turned, his cylinder and pony cylinder 
moved to one side unbalancing him.  Air migrated to the feet of 
his drysuit and his legs started to rise.  He was not wearing 
ankle weights.  He tried to swim back down and to right himself 
but he was unable to do so.  His regulator came loose and he 
replaced it correctly.  He then made a feet first ascent to the 
surface.  At the surface he was hyperventilating and felt weak 
and he was unable to keep his face out of the water.  He 
signalled to his boat then inflated his BCD and managed to 
regain a vertical posture.  He was assisted into the boat and 
placed on oxygen.  His dive duration was 8 min.  His buddy 
surfaced normally.  The boat was in a location that prevented 
contact with the Coastguard.  Once other divers had been 
recovered the boat moved and the Coastguard was alerted.  
The boat returned to the shore and the diver was taken by 
ambulance and helicopter to a recompression facility.  
Examination revealed no symptoms of DCI, and no further 
action was required. 
August 2012 12/138 
Two divers descended to a depth of 21m.  One of the pair had 
some difficulty getting down and her buddy assisted her; once 
underwater the problem seemed to be resolved.  With 4 min no 
stop time remaining one of the pair deployed a DSMB using her 
octopus regulator.  This regulator began to free flow and the 
DSMB reel jammed.  She held onto some wreckage and sorted 
out the reel and then used the free flowing regulator to make 
her ascent.  The diver decided to miss out a safety stop 
because her air supply was getting low.  At around 4m the other 
diver became buoyant again and they made a fast ascent to the 
surface.  The diver with the free flow had just enough gas to 
inflate her BCD.  No computer alarms were activated.  The diver 
with the free flow had a PFO and was using nitrox 40 and air 
tables.  No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
August 2012 12/315 
Solent Coastguard received a report of a diver having missed 
stops following a dive to 33m for 35 min, there were problems 
with SMB, and a slow ascent to 6m then missed 20 min of 
stops, no symptoms had developed, as a precaution the 
casualty and buddy were transferred to Chichester HLS by R-
104, medical advice was obtained.  (Coastguard report).

A diver felt unwell the day after a dive. "Had an abnormal 
ascent on a dive on Saturday.  Severe headache and pain 
stretching round my jaw and has been getting considerably 
worse.  Depth dived 32m.  Keep feeling dizzy and falling asleep 
not taken any pain killers. Have been to see my doctor and he 
has given me antibiotics and an ear spray to be taken three 
times a day.  Have had blood coming out of my ear, my head 
feels like it's going to explode!" The casualty was taken from 
home address to hospital by ambulance.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2012 12/230 
A diver was preparing to dive from a RHIB and whilst kitting he 
accidentally dropped one of his weight pouches of 7 kg over the 
side of the boat. He replaced the weight with 5 kg of spare 
weights from a second RHIB. The diver entered the water with 
his buddy and did a weight check and was then able to descend 
easily. Both divers were using nitrox 32 and conducted an 
uneventful dive on a wreck for a bottom time of 27 min and a 
maximum depth of 35m. The pair ascended and conducted a 
deep stop at 17m for 1 min followed by stops required by their 
computers of 3 min at 9m and 3 min at 6m; these stops were 
completed without any difficulty. As the pair started to ascend 
for a safety stop at 5m the diver who had lost his weight was 
unable to control his buoyancy and made a direct ascent to the 
surface missing an indicated 1 min of further stops. The diver 
was recovered into the RHIB and, as his computer was 
signalling SOS, he was placed on oxygen. His buddy completed 
his remaining safety stops and surfaced a short time later 
without incident. After being on oxygen for 11 min there were no 
symptoms of DCI and oxygen was discontinued. The diver did 
not dive again that day and experienced no further problems. 
August 2012 12/324 
Brixham Coastguard tasked Plymouth RNLI lifeboat to meet a 
dive boat en route to Plymouth from a dive in Bigbury Bay to 
transfer a diver who had experienced a rapid assent. The diver 
was met by west country ambulance and taken to DDRC 
Plymouth  (Coastguard report). 
September 2012 12/328 
Shetland Coastguard was alerted to two divers that had made 
rapid ascent from dive, asymptomatic but had missed 
decompression stops.  First diver 8min stops, second diver 
14min stops. Shetland Coastguard alerted the duty doctor at 
Stromness. The vessel was met by Stromness Coastguard 
team and an ambulance.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2012 12/166 
A pair of divers were diving in the lee of an island.  After about 8 
min they felt the pull of the current and tried to swim against it 
back into shelter behind the island.  This was hard work so they 
drifted with the current.  A little later one of the divers attempted 
to attract the attention of the other to signal that they had 
reached their maximum depth of 30m.  This diver was ahead of 
the other and rather than swim back she took her regulator out 
and shouted.  The other diver swam to her.  He found that she 
was experiencing difficulties replacing and purging her 
regulator.  He saw that she was becoming distressed, took hold 
of her BCD and gave her his alternative source.  They had 
started to rise and their SMB line was above them and slack; 
the troubled diver dropped the reel to avoid entanglement.  The 
rescuing diver dumped air from their drysuits to slow their 
ascent and then realised that they were sinking again.  He used 
the distressed diver's BCD to lift them rapidly to the surface.  At 
the surface he indicated distress and they were quickly 
recovered into the boat.  The troubled diver was placed on 
oxygen but no symptoms developed and no further action was 
taken.  Their dive duration was 17 min. 
September 2012 12/161 
A pair of divers were engaged in a drift dive at a maximum 
depth of 11m.  The SMB line became entangled around the 
cylinder valve of one of the pair.  The diver thought that the line 
had gone taut and he tugged it and let out more line.  The 
action of pulling on the line partially closed the valve.  The extra 
line that he released then became tangled on his fin's quick 
release clip. Whilst trying to resolve these issues the diver 
floated quickly to the surface.  The diver re-descended to 
resolve the problem.  His buddy assisted and took the SMB 
line.  The partially closed valve caused his cylinder pressure 
gauge to fluctuate.  His buddy gave him his octopus regulator 
and they made a safe ascent to the surface.  No subsequent ill 
effects were experienced. 
September 2012 12/334 
Solent Coastguard received a call from a dive support vessel 
reporting that a diver had made a rapid ascent following a dive 
to 52m; the diver was placed under observation and 
administered oxygen, no assistance required at this time.  
(Coastguard report). 
September 2012 12/375 
Three divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 20m.  
Approximately 30 min into the dive, one of the three indicated 
that he wanted to ascend.  A DSMB was deployed and they 
began their ascent.  At about 10m the diver who had indicated 
that he wanted to ascend lost control of his buoyancy.  He 
made a rapid inverted  ascent to the surface.  He was 
recovered into the boat.  He was cold and then complained of a 
headache.  He was placed on oxygen.  Diving medical advice 
was sought and the diver was taken by ambulance to hospital 
from where he was discharged 3 hours later. 
September 2012 12/209 
Following a previous dive to a maximum depth of 21m and a 
total duration of 31 min three divers conducted a dive to a 
maximum depth of 21m.  11 min into the dive one of the divers 
noticed it becoming harder to draw gas from his regulator and, 
after five or six breaths, he was unable to gain an adequate 
supply of gas even though his 15 lt cylinder was reading 180 
bar contents. The diver switched to his 3 lt pony system, which 
was charged to 200 bar and informed his buddy that he had a 
problem and needed to surface. His buddy returned an OK 
signal and the diver started his ascent from approximately 19m. 
At 17m the diver noticed that his pony cylinder contents was 
reading just above zero and believed this was due to his 
excessive breathing rate. Believing he was now out of gas the 
diver decided to swim back down to his buddy and take his 
alternate supply. After taking a few breaths the diver signalled 
that the pair should surface immediately and all three divers 
ascended. During the ascent, at 15m, the diver's computer 
indicated that they were ascending too fast and in dumping gas 
the pair started to descend again and they sank back to 19m. 
The diver's buddy tried to inflate the diver's BCD but there was 
no gas available, however the pair eventually managed to start 
to ascend again. The pair ascended normally until reaching 9m 
and then the diver became positively buoyant and surfaced too 
quickly. On the surface the divers checked each other and 
found all to be OK. The diver checked his regulator again and 
found it to be working and that he could now put air into his 
BCD. Total dive time was 15 min.

Technique Incidents 
 
 
November 2011 12/031 
A pair of divers descended to a wreck at a maximum depth of 
24m. Visibility on the site was described as poor at 2m. The 
lead diver sent the shotweight to the surface as they would 
have been unlikely to have found it again and they planned to 
ascend on a DSMB. There was a slight ground swell on the site 
but nothing the divers had not experienced previously. The dive 
went well and despite the poor visibility the pair explored most 
of the wreck. At 18 min into the dive the less experienced diver 
showed her buddy her cylinder pressure gauge which was at 
100 bar. The pair continued to explore the stern section and at 
24 min the gauge was at 70 bar. The pair agreed to ascend at 
that time and the diver deployed her DSMB using her own gas 
source even though the lead diver had offered his own alternate 
source for the purpose. The pair ascended face to face and at 
9m the lead diver checked his buddy's gas contents and noted 
it was around 20 bar. He showed the gauge to his buddy and 
offered her his alternate source which she took and breathed 
from. The pair made a controlled ascent to the surface and the 
low gas diver was able to inflate her own BCD. The divers were 
recovered into their cover boat and the low gas diver was found 
to have 10 bar remaining in her cylinder. Her buddy had 70 bar 
remaining. 
January 2012 12/361 
Casualty was on the surface in the swimming pool, using a 
drysuit for the first time. She had her regulator and mask in 
place. Her feet floated up as the air had migrated to the drysuit 
boots and the diver went into a horizontal position. The 
instructor was holding onto her first stage and allowed the 
casualty to try to right herself as she thought the casualty could 
breathe with the regulator in place. The casualty struggled to 
roll over and then panicked. She dropped her weightbelt and 
turned upright on the surface.  The trainee aspirated water. 
April 2012 12/100 
Three divers using open circuit equipment entered the water 
and started their descent.  Separately a rebreather diver also 
began his dive.  Visibility was low and one of the three divers 
became separated from the other two.  The two divers 
continued.  The lone open circuit diver then began to follow the 
solo rebreather diver.  They were diving on a wreck in a 
maximum depth of 29m.  After about 25 min the rebreather 
diver found the open circuit diver following him and when he 
checked this diver's air supply he found that he only had 70 bar 
remaining.  The open circuit diver's computer indicated a few 
minutes of stops.  The rebreather diver signalled that the open 
circuit diver should start his ascent and he moved to the top of 
the wreck.  The open circuit diver followed and the rebreather 
diver again indicated that he should ascend.  The open circuit 
diver had a DSMB but no reel.  The rebreather diver deployed 
his DSMB and assisted the open circuit diver, who was now 
struggling with a slipping weightbelt, to ascend.  They 
encountered the shotline and conducted a safety stop at 6m.  
They surfaced with a total dive time of 40 min and the open 
circuit diver had just 5 bar remaining in his cylinder.  After the 
dive the open circuit diver stated that this was his first dive in 
UK waters, all his previous experience had been in warm 
waters.  He had had a reel at the start of the dive but it had 
become snagged at some point during the dive and lost.  His 
contents gauge hose was also found to be relatively short 
making it difficult to read the gauge.  It is suggested that 
narcosis may have affected this diver. 
 
 
May 2012 12/078 
A diver who had previously conducted ten dives in a membrane 
drysuit with a cuff dump had purchased a new drysuit with a 
shoulder dump. She was keen to practice with it before joining a 
planned club trip on a bank holiday weekend. After a thorough 
pre-dive check and discussion on how to use the valve, the 
diver entered the water, with an instructor, and descended to a 
platform at 6m where they practiced a number of drysuit drills. 
The diver indicated she was comfortable and so the pair 
continued to a maximum depth of 17m. The diver indicated that 
she was enjoying the dive and that the suit was good but later, 
around 15 min into the dive, she felt she was ascending. She 
then lost confidence and was no longer able to remember how 
to operate her shoulder dump valve and was at one point seen 
trying to dump gas from her non-existent cuff dump. The diver 
held onto some rocks on the bottom and became inverted and 
was too scared to let go the rocks to signal her distress. Her 
buddy opened the shoulder dump and then pulled down her 
legs and assisted her back to the surface. A controlled ascent 
was conducted and neither diver suffered any ill effects. A 
subsequent dive later the same day to a maximum depth of 8m 
involved no significant incidents other than minor buoyancy 
control issues. The diver has subsequently had a cuff dump 
fitted to the suit and conducted dives without any buoyancy 
issues. 
June 2012 12/217 
A pair of divers entered the water by stride entry from a pier for 
a second dive of the day. The pair exchanged OK signals and 
descended to 7m and again exchanged signals.  They repeated 
this around 11m and one indicated his intention to descend 
further to which his buddy responded in a positive manner. At a 
depth of 20m the diver began inspecting an object on the 
seabed and after circling it he noticed that his buddy was not in 
his vicinity. The diver switched on his torch and rotated through 
360 degrees a number of times including looking and signalling 
above him but found no sign of his buddy. After 2 min of 
searching the diver started to ascend and on reaching 3m there 
was still no sign of his buddy in the water or on the surface and 
so he surfaced omitting his optional 3 min safety stop after a 
total dive time of 9 min. On the surface there was no immediate 
sign of his buddy and the diver waited a further 2 min scanning 
for bubbles on the surface before exiting the water and de-
kitting. The diver climbed to a higher observation point and 
searched the surface and shoreline for a further 8 min before 
retrieving his mobile phone from his car and calling the 
Coastguard. The missing diver surfaced approximately 25 min 
later after a total dive time of around 47 min to be met by the 
Coastguard team who had arrived by that point. The 
Coastguard stood down a lifeboat and rescue helicopter which 
had been tasked and shortly after the police arrived and took 
statements. 
July 2012 12/132 
A pair of divers conducted a quarry dive to a maximum depth of 
18m.  For one of the pair it was her first dive after a long lay-off.  
They carried out some drills in shallow water and then 
continued the dive.  After a while the diver indicated to her 
instructor that her fin had come loose.  The instructor found that 
the heel strap had slipped and that her foot had ridden up inside 
the leg of her drysuit.  The instructor attempted to resolve the 
problem and then decided to terminate the dive.  They followed 
a slope upwards.  The diver then indicated that her fin had 
come off completely; they searched but could not find it.  They 
continued to follow the slope; the diver then lost the other fin.  
At this point the instructor used a controlled buoyant lift to raise

her to the surface.  She was assisted from the water and 
suffered no subsequent ill effects. 
August 2012 12/140 
An instructor and a trainee completed some training drills.  At 
this point the trainee had 85 bar.  They then followed a line 
down to a depth of 18m.  The water was cold and dark and the 
trainee became a little anxious.  The instructor led her to 
shallower, warmer and lighter water.  After 10 min the trainee 
signalled that she was out of air.  She took the instructor's 
alternative source.  They moved to a shotline and made a 
controlled ascent to the surface missing a planned safety stop.  
No subsequent ill effects were experienced.

Brixham Coastguard tasked Berry Head Coastguard to pass 
safety advice to two divers diving at Oxen Cove Brixham, the

Equipment Incidents 
 
 
October 2011 12/223 
A pair of divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 55m 
using trimix 18/40 as bottom gas. During ascent, at a depth of 
around 38m, one of the divers experienced his regulator 
becoming tight indicating a problem. The diver changed to his 
second regulator on his manifolded twin-set which did not 
appear to be delivering gas. The diver then switched to his 
buddy's spare regulator. The pair then ascended to their first 
decompression stop at 32m where the diver switched to his 
nitrox 32 decompression mix. The diver and his buddy 
completed all decompression stops including an additional 5 
min at 4.5m using nitrox 80.  After exiting the water the diver 
checked his equipment and found that his manifold valve was 
not open enough to allow gas to flow between the cylinders and 
one cylinder was empty. On opening the valve gas flowed into 
the open cylinder.  The diver tested his spare regulator on a 
second dive and found it hard to breathe from in the minus 
position but much easier once in the plus position. The diver 
concluded that he had not fully switched it to the plus position 
when changing regulators.  Neither diver suffered any ill effects. 
October 2011 12/007 
Two trainee divers with their instructor and a supervising diver 
were conducting a training dive at a depth of 6m. After a 
duration of 28 min one of the students experienced a free flow 
from his BCD inflator hose. The supervising diver took him to 
the surface using a controlled buoyant lift and then they both 
returned to shore. The instructor surfaced with the second 
student and also returned to shore. The BCD was changed for a 
spare one and the group returned to the water to compete a 
weight check and weightbelt removal. On inspection the low 
pressure inflator was found to have lost a retainer nut allowing 
the spigot 'O' ring to fall out causing the free flow. 
October 2011 12/046 
A pair of divers were at a depth of 30m during a dive where they 
had reached a maximum depth of 32m. One of the divers 
experienced a flooding of the loop of her rebreather. The diver 
switched to her stage cylinder but during this process her mask 
was dislodged and she was still taking in water. The diver 
ascended as slowly as possible. Total dive time was 40 min. 
The diver was given oxygen by the onsite rescue team, which 
she breathed for 20 min. No ill effects were reported. 
October 2011 12/021 
During training for an advanced decompression course a diver 
was on the second dive of the day after a 2 hour surface 
interval. Towards the end of the dive to a maximum depth of 
22m the diver prepared to perform a mid-water DSMB 
deployment as part of the course. Having ascended from 18m 
to 15m the diver removed her DSMB from stowage and 
proceeded to deploy it using her octopus. The octopus stuck 
and started to free flow; attempts to stop it by turning the 
mouthpiece down and breathing from it did not work. The diver 
took the instructor's alternate supply and the instructor turned 
off the diver's cylinder and then turned it back on again. This 
stopped the free flow and, after checking gas contents, the 
diver switched back to her main supply and then completed the 
exercise including simulated decompression stops at 6m. 
October 2011 12/116 
A pair of divers were diving on a wreck in a maximum depth of 
26m.  One of the pair then felt buoyant and realised that her 
weightbelt had fallen off.  She started a buoyant ascent but was 
able to stop herself by holding onto the wreck.  She was then 
able to get under a large metal plate.  She indicated to her 
buddy what had happened.  The buddy secured a line to the 
wreck and went to look for the weightbelt.  Unable to find it he 
ran the line back to the shotline and secured it to the wreck 
along the route.  The pair then made their way back to the 
shotline with the buoyant diver holding on to the line.  She was 
able to use the shotline to control her ascent and they made a 
safe return to the surface. 
December 2011 12/029 
A pair of divers were conducted a training drill for a diving 
course at a freshwater quarry. The student diver had previously 
completed a lift and shift exercise without incident. The pair 
then ascended from their maximum depth of 14m to 10m to 
practise deploying a DSMB mid-water. The student deployed 
the DSMB successfully without incident but then, as he went to 
stow his alternate source, it began to free flow. The student 
attempted to stem the free flow by breathing off it and pressing 
the purge button. The free flow would not stop and so the pair 
made a direct ascent to the surface, with the instructor making 
his alternate source available if required.  At the surface the 
student inflated his BCD.  On surfacing the student had 30 bar 
remaining in his cylinder and this ran out whilst they swam back 
to the shore. 
December 2011 12/032 
An assistant instructor and student entered the water to conduct 
training for a simulated decompression dive. Following a dry run 
on shore the pair descended a shotline to 10m. The instructor 
then demonstrated the use of a reel for a distance line. During 
deployment the line became entangled in the reel. The line was 
untangled without the need to cut the line and the lesson was 
aborted. The divers continued with an uneventful scenic dive. 
January 2012 12/051 
A pair of divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 48m. 
One diver was using a single 15 lt main cylinder with a 3 lt pony 
both of which were charged to 232 bar. His buddy was using 
independent 300 bar 10 lt cylinders and carried a 7 lt stage with 
nitrox 63. After 6 min at their maximum depth, spent taking 
pictures, the pair started to ascend at an angle up a wall. At a 
depth of around 45m the first diver's regulator began to free 
flow, slowly at first but becoming progressively worse. The diver 
switched to his alternate source from the same first stage and 
both started to ascend. The diver's buddy released the diver's 
pony regulator and got him to switch to it. He then turned off the 
main cylinder and after waiting a short while turned it back on 
again but it continued to free flow and so it was turned off again. 
At around 30m the diver switched to his buddy's spare 10 lt 
regulator. As the pair cleared the wall at a depth of around 25m 
they swam to a shotline a short distance away. At 18m the 
buddy indicated to stop to allow him to complete a deep stop 
required by his computer then both continued to ascend to 5m 
to conduct a 3 min safety stop. At this stop the buddy handed 
over his 3 lt stage which the diver switched to. The buddy then 
switched from his primary cylinder, which was now down to 60 
bar, to his secondary that the diver had been using, which had 
160 bar remaining. The pair then surfaced and the diver orally 
inflated his BCD whilst his buddy supported him. Both divers 
signalled OK and swam back to the shore, neither suffered any 
ill effects. The affected regulator was swapped and a 
subsequent dive carried out without incident.

A pair of divers were at the deepest point of their dive at 19m 
when one of the divers experienced a free flow. The diver 
attempted to stop the flow by breathing out and hitting the 
regulator but neither worked. The diver checked his gas 
contents at that time which read 150 bar and shortly after this 
had reduced by 10-20 bar. The diver took his buddy's alternate 
source and the pair conducted an ascent to the surface. The 
ascent was a little fast at first and then the pair descended 
again. The re-descent caused the divers' computers to require a 
decompression stop at 6m. The pair started to ascend again 
and had drifted to a fixed line and so used this to help to control 
their ascent. The pair also experienced problems with the 
donated alternate source as the hose was too short.  The short 
hose made access to the BCD controls more difficult and 
resulted in the mouthpiece almost being pulled out on more 
than one occasion, adding to the divers' discomfort. The pair 
reached 6m and conducted the required decompression stop 
plus a 3 min safety stop. They then surfaced, the free flowing 
cylinder was switched off and the diver's BCD inflated orally. 
The diver's cylinder contents read zero but there was still some 
residual pressure remaining in the cylinder and the regulator 
first stage had not flooded. The buddy's contents read 100 bar 
at the conclusion of the dive. Total dive time was 18 min. 
March 2012 12/059 
Following an uneventful first dive, on a wreck, to a maximum 
depth of 24m for a total duration of 40 min, including a safety 
stop at 6m for 3 min, a pair of divers entered the water, after a 
surface interval of 2 hours, to dive an offshore pinnacle. The 
pair descended down a wall to a maximum depth of 32m and, 
after a few minutes, ascended to around 25 to 22m for 
approximately 15 min. One of the divers started to notice 
increased buoyancy and that the shoulder dump on her drysuit 
was continually dumping gas. She also noticed that she had 
less gas remaining than she expected. The diver had recently 
had her suit serviced and so did not consider that it could have 
been the problem at the time. The pair decided to ascend and 
at 12m the diver struggled to control her buoyancy, she was 
also being affected by a heavy surface swell. At this point her 
gas contents was down to 60 bar. The diver tried to deploy her 
DSMB but abandoned it when her gas supply went to zero. She 
went to switch to her pony regulator but found that there was no 
gas available from that either and so she finned for the surface. 
On surfacing the diver started to panic because she felt she had 
no means of inflating her BCD, forgetting that she had an 
emergency cylinder fitted. The diver signalled the boat which 
started to approach immediately. She tried to release her 
weightbelt but was unable to find the release because she was 
wearing new mitt style gloves, which she was unaccustomed to. 
The diver was unable to orally inflate her BCD because she was 
struggling to stay afloat and to breathe having taken in a little 
water on the surface. Once the boat was alongside she 
managed to climb onboard and was placed on oxygen for 30 
min. The diver had missed 2 min of safety stops but, other than 
being shaken and exhausted, suffered no ill effects. Her buddy 
completed her safety stops and surfaced unaware of the 
problems experienced by her buddy.  Subsequent examination 
of the equipment identified that the diver's drysuit inflator hose 
had not been included in the servicing and had been sticking on 
causing the buoyancy problems and unexpected depletion of 
gas.  In the rush to enter the water on the pinnacle the pair had 
omitted a buddy check that could have identified that the diver's 
pony cylinder had not been turned on. 
April 2012 12/077 
A rebreather diver had taken a sabbatical from rebreather diving 
for 14 months due to problems obtaining oxygen cells and had 
returned to open circuit diving in the intervening period. The 
diver had done a number of build up dives having returned to  
 
using his rebreather, both in the pool and then at an inland site, 
gradually building his experience back up to 40m in preparation 
for diving over Easter. The diver had prepared his rebreather 
the night before and completed a single dive without incident on 
the first day, including deploying a DSMB without assistance. 
Once back onboard the boat the diver did not have any 
problems other than feeling a little tired. He did not have any 
symptoms but was glad to be back onboard as he hadn't 
enjoyed the dive. On returning to his accommodation the diver 
stripped down his rebreather in order to change the scrubber 
material and dry out the unit head. In doing so the diver noticed 
that he had previously omitted to fit the scrubber canister O 
ring. This may have allowed some CO2 to bypass the scrubber 
during the dive. The diver had not encountered any headache, 
breathlessness or any other ill effects during the dive. 
April 2012 12/101 
Two divers were at a depth of 21m when the regulator of one of 
the pair started to free flow.  The diver was unable to stop the 
free flow.  His buddy gave him his alternative source and turned 
off the relevant cylinder.  When the valve was re-opened the 
free flow continued.  The divers then made a normal ascent 
using the alternative source.  No subsequent ill effects were 
experienced.  The regulator had been recently serviced.  The 
diver adjusted the regulator and conducted two further dives 
without problems.  The water temperature was 7 deg C. 
April 2012 12/214 
A few minutes into a dive, at a depth of 10m, a diver began 
sucking in water through his regulator. The diver switched to his 
own alternate source but was unable to get any gas, although, 
after checking later, the alternate source worked correctly. The 
diver reached for his pony cylinder regulator but inadvertently 
picked up his main regulator again and again took in more 
water. The diver then signalled out of gas to his buddy who was 
only a metre or so away and she swam towards him and 
donated her pony regulator which the diver was able to breathe 
from. The diver continued to breathe from his buddy's pony until 
his breathing had settled and then the pair conducted a normal 
ascent and were recovered by their cover boat. On subsequent 
inspection the main regulator showed that the cover and 
diaphragm had parted company with the regulator. The 
alternate source was found to be working fine on the surface. 
April 2012 12/079 
An instructor was with a group of trainees at a depth of 16m.  
He noticed a diver from a separate party swimming by; this 
diver's weightbelt had slipped down over his hips and looked 
like it would fall off.  He indicated the problem to the diver and 
the diver's own instructor came to assist.  The belt slipped down 
to the diver's knees.  They assisted him to a shotline and used 
this to make an ascent.  During the ascent the weightbelt 
became completely detached from the diver.  They made a safe 
ascent to the surface.  It later transpired that the rescuing diver 
had assisted this same diver to adjust his weightbelt earlier in 
the dive. 
April 2012 12/067 
A pair of divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 36m 
for a total duration of 33 min. One of the divers was using twin 
12's setup Hogrithian style [sic] and the regulators had been 
lying unused for several months. The pair ascended from the 
maximum depth to a 6m shelf and the diver prepared to 
practice DSMB deployment as planned. The DSMB CO2 
canister failed to fire and so the diver switched to his necklaced 
backup regulator to prepared to deploy using the long hose 
primary regulator. The primary regulator started to free flow and, 
after initial attempts to stop it failed, the diver shut down the 
right hand post and signalled the problem to his buddy. The

diver then sent up the DSMB using oral inflation and terminated 
the dive. 
June 2012 12/226 
A diver was preparing to dive and had kitted up on a bench. As 
he stood up his pony cylinder fell off the cylinder on his back 
and crashed to the floor behind him. There was a hissing of 
escaping air and so the diver de-kitted and waited for the 
hissing to stop before inspecting the  damage. The A clamp 
was found to have taken the brunt of the fall and had been 
damaged allowed gas to escape. The diver packed away the 
damaged pony and regulator and continued the planned dive 
with his main cylinder only, which was undamaged. On further 
inspection the pony clamp was found to have a fault which 
meant that despite attaching with a secure sounding 'click' the 
lugs did not seat fully and the pony could slip out. The clamp 
was returned to the manufacturer who removed the design from 
sale and produced a more secure design. The diver was 
provided a replacement free of charge. 
July 2012 12/134 
A pair of divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 
23m.  One of the divers had just under 50 bar remaining in his 
twin 10 lt cylinders as they deployed a DSMB for their ascent.  
This diver then noticed that his regulator was becoming hard to 
breathe from.  He checked his pressure gauge and it read about 
40 bar.  He took his buddy's octopus and they ascended to 6m 
where they conducted a 3 min safety stop.  The buddy switched 
to his pony cylinder to conserve his air supply.  The diver 
switched back to his own regulator to see if he had in fact run 
out of air; the regulator was still hard to breathe from but it 
continued to supply air and the pressure gauge still indicated 25 
bar when they reached the surface.  No subsequent problems 
were experienced with this equipment and, when tested, the 
pressure gauge was found to under-read by 5 bar.  No cause 
was given for the regulator problem.

Miscellaneous Incidents 
 
 
October 2011 12/236 
Clyde Coastguard received a call from a local vessel reporting 
seeing two divers south of Largs pier. The informant was just 
leaving the pier at Largs and just at the Gogo Burn south of 
Largs pier, he reported that "there are two divers with full kit 
going into the water they looked as though they were struggling a 
bit to get under, the wind is 20 knots in a south west direction 
here, the divers have no flags up, nobody on the shore, it's a 
very unusual place for divers to go into the water as there aren’t 
any wrecks or anything there.  Just a bit concerned perhaps you 
could get a Coastguard to have a look." Clyde Coastguard 
tasked Largs CRT to attend, when they arrived on scene two 
divers were safely ashore on the promenade, they advised them 
that they should have had a dive flag and informed Clyde 
Coastguard of their intention.  They have taken the advice 
onboard, they intend to do another dive this afternoon around the 
Gourock area at Levan.  (Coastguard report).

difficulties; a vessel approached and recovered the diver. FAGI  
(Coastguard report). 
April 2012 12/268 
Belfast Coastguard received a call reporting an overdue dive 
boat, which left Ballycastle to dive HMS Drake, the divers kitted 
up at 14:30 hoping they would be back at 18:00, the RHIB had 
eight to ten people onboard. The vessel returned to harbour.  
FAGI.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2012 12/271 
Falmouth Coastguard was passed a 999 call which was 
originally received by MRCC Dover reporting a possible overdue 
diver at Mullion Cove, Cornwall. Porthoustock CRT was tasked 
to attend Mullion Cove and establish the safety of the party. 
Dover received a second call confirming the divers were all 
safely ashore, CRT made contact with the party and collected 
details.  (Coastguard report).

Brixham Coastguard tasked Plymouth Coastguard, Plymouth 
RNLI inshore lifeboat and police launch Paul Trevis to search the 
surrounding area of Devil's Point after a diver SMB was picked 
up by angling vessel Tee Jay. Nothing untoward found.  
(Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
May 2012 12/120 
A group of divers were on their way to a dive site when they 
heard a Coastguard radio message asking for assistance for two 
canoeists who were in difficulties.  They found them on some 
rocks.  The sea condition was rough and divers entered the 
water to assist the canoeists to the boat.  The water temperature 
was 11 deg C, the canoeists had no protective clothing and one 
lifejacket between them.  Both were suffering from the cold and 
steps were taken to keep them as warm as possible.  The 
Coastguard was informed and the canoeists were taken to the 
shore.  The party were met by a paramedic who took over from 
the divers.  A lifeboat arrived and recovered the swamped 
canoe. 
May 2012 12/225 
A pair of divers descended to a wreck at a maximum depth of 
35m. On reaching the wreck the divers noticed that the wreck 
had a large amount of fishing lines and ropes fouling it and 
visibility was poor at around 1m. One of the divers speculated 
afterwards whether they should have aborted the dive at that 
point but rationalised that they hadn't perhaps due to narcosis. 
The pair continued over the deck and slowly made their way 
around the superstructure. The pair came across a lifting bag 
attached to the shotline, which was floating above a hole in the 
deck that the shotweight had dropped into. Although not tasked 
to do so one of the divers decided to inflate the lifting bag and 
send the shotweight to the surface as they were close to 
completing their dive time. After doing so his gas contents had 
dropped to around 100 bar. The diver indicated to his buddy to 
ascend to which the buddy agreed. As the ascent started the 
diver discovered that the lanyard attached to his torch had 
become entangled in fishing line and removed his line cutter to 
cut it, assisted by his buddy. The diver then discovered that his 
fin had become entangled and he noticed the whole surrounding 
area was festooned with fishing line and rope. The diver's 
breathing rate began to increase, he lost buoyancy control and 
his mask flooded but his buddy was able to cut him free and he 
floated upwards. The diver then 'bounced' between 28m and 
19m before regaining control at 20m. The diver looked around 
for his buddy but could not see him and decided to continue his 
ascent rather than risk increasing his decompression penalty 
looking for him in the poor visibility. The diver conducted 6 min of 
required decompression stops at 6m and surfaced after a total 
dive time of 29 min. The buddy had become entangled himself 
but had managed to cut himself free at the cost of the loss of his 
pony cylinder and he surfaced safely but was somewhat shaken.  
He was back in the boat by the time the other diver surfaced. 
The diver lost his torch as a result of the entanglement. 
June 2012 12/286 
Holyhead Coastguard was made aware of two divers who were 
apparently in difficulties at Trefor beach Gwynedd. The divers 
struck the pier, and were holding onto it in rough sea conditions, 
a vessel assisted one diver, the other made it to shore unaided, 
an off duty first responder assisted one of the divers who was 
taken to hospital for examination.  (Coastguard report).

report they were self launching to a report of a diver in difficulty 
near St Abbs harbour. MRCC Forth dispatched Eyemouth 
Coastguard to assist and alerted ARCC for info. The lifeboat 
recovered the diver to shore and reported although exhausted, 
he required no medical attention. Eyemouth Coastguard later 
confirmed this to be the case and ops terminated at 1228 UTC 
when units were stood down.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2012 12/320 
Brixham Coastguard made enquiries and a Ministry of Defence 
launch was dispatched when two divers failed to notify their

Fatalities 
 
November 2011 12/088 
Three divers entered the water and started their descent.  They 
planned to dive to 112m to the bridge of a wreck.  One of the 
three experienced difficulty clearing his ears and they stopped 
at both 5m and 10m.  This diver got to a depth of 15m, 
experienced more ear problems and ascended back to around 
13m.  At this point he signalled that he would abort the dive and 
that the other two should continue without him; this they did.  
The lone diver failed to return to the surface.  It was some time 
before the party realised that this diver was missing.  An 
extensive search was conducted involving boats and 
helicopters but the missing diver was not found.  It is believed 
that this diver started his descent with nitrox 50 and would have 
switched to trimix 10/70 at around 20m.  He was using a 
rebreather.  There was a suggestion that he may have suffered 
hypoxia. 
January 2012 12/052 
Three divers completed a dive to a maximum depth of 30m and 
a total duration of 45 min including a 3 min safety stop at 5m. 
All three divers had used nitrox 32 with one diver having his 
computer set to 28% for additional conservatism; his buddies' 
computers were set to 32%. The three had descended the 
boat's mooring line and swum into a slight current for the first 
part of the dive and then drifted slowly back to the mooring line 
on their return; all had got slightly cold towards the end of the 
dive. After surfacing and regaining their boat they removed their 
equipment and the diver also removed his suit and re-entered 
the water to relieve himself which was his normal practice. All 
the divers dried themselves and changed into dry clothes. The 
diver took his thermos flask and went and sat on a bench for a 
cup of tea but subsequently fell over and became unresponsive.  
CPR was started and the oxygen kit prepared. The boat was 
released from the mooring line and an emergency call made 
whilst the boat headed back to harbour. CPR continued during 
the return to harbour and the boat was met by an ambulance. 
The ambulance crew came aboard and checked for vital signs 
asking for CPR to continue whilst this was being done and the 
diver was being prepared for evacuation. The diver was taken 
to hospital but did not survive. A subsequent post mortem 
identified that death had occurred from a burst artery close to 
the heart. 
March 2012 12/009 
A student on a rebreather course was at a depth of 30m with an 
instructor and a fellow student. 30 min into the dive the diver 
signalled that he had a problem and seemed to have trouble 
breathing. The diver was taken to the surface whilst continuing 
to struggle to breathe. The diver was made buoyant on the 
surface and shortly after lost consciousness. The diver was 
recovered back onto the boat where CPR was carried out whilst 
the boat returned to the shore (40 min approx.). The diver was 
taken to hospital but did not recover. 
April 2012 12/010 
A diver, who had not dived since gaining his initial qualification 
fifteen years previously, had been undertaking refresher training 
in the pool over the winter. The diver had conducted an 
uneventful and enjoyable dive earlier in the day to a maximum 
depth of 8m for 15 min. After a surface interval of 2 hours and 
20 min the diver entered the water with an experienced buddy 
with a plan to dive to a maximum depth of 8m for 30 min. On 
entering the water some time was spent adjusting buoyancy 
before descending and commencing the dive. Approximately 7 
min into the dive the diver was seen ascending slowly towards 
the surface whilst he was swimming along. His buddy followed 
him to the surface where the diver indicated that he was having 
difficulty breathing. The diver was advised to keep his regulator 
in whilst his buddy began towing him towards the shore. The 
buddy could initially hear the diver breathing from his regulator 
but after towing a short distance the sounds of breathing 
stopped. The buddy checked the diver who appeared to be 
unconscious and he began administering rescue breaths whilst 
towing towards the exit point and shouting for help. An RHIB in 
the area came alongside and offered assistance. The diver was 
recovered into the RHIB and given oxygen enriched rescue 
breaths with chest compressions and the emergency services 
were contacted. The diver was returned to shore where 
resuscitation efforts continued for 40 min until the arrival of a 
rescue helicopter.  The diver was airlifted by helicopter to 
hospital but did not recover. 
July 2012 12/110 
A trainee diver conducted a solo dive from the shore.  The 
maximum depth is thought to have been around 7m.  He was 
later seen face down at the surface and the action of the waves 
washed his body towards the shore.  A friend waded out and 
found him face down with his mask off and his BCD deflated.  
The emergency services were alerted and the casualty was 
airlifted to hospital where he was declared dead.  There was 
some suggestion that a medical event may have been involved. 
 
 
Decompression Illness 
 
November 2011 12/036 
A diver conducted a series of dives on a diving holiday. He 
undertook a dive using nitrox 28, to a maximum depth of 36m, 
for a duration of 47 min with 16 min of stops at 3m to clear his 
computer; the computer was set for diving on air. Following the 
dive, the diver had lunch and felt progressively unwell including 
symptoms of migraine, headache, dizziness and tingling and 
numbness intermittently in his left buttock. The diver took 
paracetamol and went to bed for 2 to 3 hours by which time he 
felt better. Another member group had commented to others 
that the diver had been suffering stomach cramps and 
migraines. An examination of the diver was inconclusive but a 
history revealed that the diver had experienced the same 
symptoms following a second dive of the day ever since he had 
started diving in 2004 with symptoms starting within 30 min of 
surfacing. The diver was advised not to dive for the remainder 
of the holiday and to consult his GP and a medical referee on 
his return home. The diver was seen by a medical referee who 
advised referral for a PFO test. The test revealed the diver had 
a PFO and he was awaiting a closure. 
January 2012 12/037 
A diver had completed two dives the previous day on a diving 
holiday.  On the second day the diver completed a dive to 27m 
for 55 min duration followed 86 min later by a dive to 22m for 56 
min total dive time. 60 min after surfacing the diver became 
unstable and felt nauseous. The diver reported his symptoms to 
the dive guide and was immediately put on oxygen and given 
water to drink. A recompression chamber was contacted and 

 
 
  NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2012 
48  ©BSAC - 2012 
the diver was transported to the chamber arriving 75 min after 
the onset of symptoms. The diver spent 2 hours in a chamber 
where he received recompression treatment on oxygen with air 
breaks. The diver suffered no lasting effects. 
May 2012 12/085 
A pair of divers were diving a wreck at a depth of 66m. Both 
were using rebreathers and trimix and planned a run time of 20 
min and total dive time of 60 min. Approximately 14 min into the 
dive the mouthpiece of one of the divers detached from the 
integrated bailout valve (BOV) and the loop fell away, it flooded 
and the diver inhaled water. The diver tried to reattach the 
mouthpiece and switch to the bailout open circuit supply but 
inhaled more water. He abandoned the BOV presuming he had 
not fully switched the valve and found the mouthpiece still in his 
mouth which he removed. The diver then switched to his 
alternate integrated BCD mouthpiece and, after a couple of 
attempts to reach it, managed to breathe from it but found it 
difficult as he was hyperventilating and felt it was very stiff. The 
diver signalled his buddy, who had seen the original problem 
and knew the diver had inhaled water, and he took the offered 
bailout regulator. This regulator had a free flow control device 
on it, which the diver was not aware of, and it was switched off 
so the diver was unable to obtain a breath from the regulator. 
The diver handed it back to his buddy for him to switch on, 
which he did, and returned it. The diver was now able to 
breathe but the added delay and further inhaled water meant he 
was breathing rapidly and starting to panic. Both divers were 
now concerned about the limitations of bailout gas available 
from the buddy's 7 lt bailout cylinder and so started an ascent. 
The diver began finning hard to initiate the ascent, whilst his 
buddy prepared to deploy a DSMB. The buddy dropped his 
DSMB and then took the troubled diver's DSMB but dropped 
this as well in the confusion as the pair were surrounded by a 
large amount of bubbles. The pair made an ascent direct to the 
surface missing 14 min of required decompression stops. The 
diver switched from his buddy's hypoxic bailout gas to his own 
oxygen bailout. The diver relaxed face down in the water trying 
to calm down but his buddy tried to lift him up. He signalled that 
he was OK and indicated for his buddy to go onto oxygen. The 
buddy then shouted for the cover boat and began swimming for 
it as he was experienced a burning pain in his shoulder and 
upper chest. The cover RHIB came alongside and recovered 
the divers. Oxygen and water were provided, a call was made 
to the Coastguard and the boat began to make way back to 
port. The buddy began vomiting shortly after getting in the boat 
and this prevented him from drinking and interrupted the 
breathing of oxygen. The shoulder and abdominal pain 
subsided within a few minutes. The RHIB returned to shore an 
the buddy was transferred to a rescue helicopter that had 
landed nearby.  Both divers were transferred by helicopter to 
hospital where both divers were assessed. Both were found to 
have lowered core temperatures and the buddy had low oxygen 
saturation. The buddy then started to develop weakness and 
numbness in his legs and lower abdomen but was able to walk 
and had some pain around his right shoulder. The diver 
displayed no symptoms and so was not recompressed. The 
buddy was recompressed and the initial treatments were 
extended due to continued symptoms.  At the end of the first 
treatment the buddy's condition deteriorated and so a further 
treatment was undertaken immediately. After several treatments 
over the next few days the buddy continued to suffer serious 
lower body detriment and he continued to receive treatment 
including physiotherapy. 
July 2012 12/154 
A diver conducted a 91 min dive to 71m including the following 
stops; 3 min at 15m, 5 min at 12m, 8 min at 9m and 34 min at 
6m.  23 hours later he dived to 78m for 82 min with the following 
stops; 4 min at 21m, 4 min at 12m, 6 min at 9m and 25 min at 
6m.  90 min later he conducted a dive to 56m for 89 min with 
the following stops; 2 min at 15m, 4 min at 12m, 6 min at 9m 
and 40 min at 6m.  Prior to this dive he felt tired.  Towards the 
end of the dive at a depth of about 30m the diver and his buddy 
had to reposition the boat’s anchor chain and a lifting bag and 
this involved hard physical work.  The diver was using open 
circuit trimix 13/60.  During the ascent, at a depth of 21m, he 
switched to nitrox 50.  At this point he noticed a pain in his left 
knee and wrist but thought little of it.  On surfacing the pain 
increased and he had a tingling on his skin which felt dry and 
rough; he sought diving medical advice.   7 hours 30 min later 
he received recompression treatment and his symptoms were 
resolved. 
July 2012 12/219 
A diver conducted two training dives in a day to 10m for 37 min 
and 2 hours 8 min later a second dive to a maximum depth of 
15m for 34 min using nitrox 32. Some time after surfacing the 
diver complained to his buddy that he was feeling slightly dizzy. 
The buddy sat him down and gave him some water to drink 
(200ml). 40 min later the buddy conducted a casualty 
assessment as a precaution. It was discovered that the diver 
had a slight tingling sensation in his left fingertips. The duty 
medical officer was contacted and the diver was advised to go 
onto oxygen and be transferred to hospital. The diver was 
transferred to hospital by ambulance and he subsequently 
received treatment at a recompression chamber. 
 
 
Illness / Injury 
 
November 2011 12/023 
A student on an entry level diver training course had completed 
two dives on the second day of the course to 4m for 59 min and 
3m for 31 min after an 80 min surface interval. At the end of the 
day the diver complained of earache. The following day the 
diver was seen by medical staff and was informed that he had a 
perforated ear drum and he was advised not to dive. 
November 2011 12/028 
A diver was completing his final sheltered water dive for his 
entry level course at a depth of 4m. After 24 min the diver 
indicated he had discomfort in his left ear on descent. The dive 
was terminated and the diver taken to a medical facility for 
treatment. The diver was advised not to dive until further notice. 
January 2012 12/035 
A snorkeler had been snorkelling from a RHIB for 2 hours. On 
returning to the RHIB the practice was that the Coxswain would 
hold the diver's right arm, leaving the left arm free to grab the 
seat pod, and then pull on the count of three. The Cox had a 
habit of pulling on two and half. The RHIB also had a hard 
rubber grab handle on the sponson just above the rubbing strip. 
On being pulled into the RHIB the diver hit his left side on the 
grab handle cracking a rib. The diver experienced severe pain 
when sleeping on his left side for a period of two weeks and all 
pain subsided after six weeks. 
April 2012 12/233 
Whilst preparing to dive a student diver discovered that the 
dump valve on her BCD had broken and she changed for a hire 
BCD. She had broken her mask the previous day and was also 
using a hired mask. The student and her instructor entered the 
water and swam through an open tunnel to the outside reef. 
Approximately 10 min into the dive the pair were at a depth of 
18m when the student started to have a problem with her mask, 
she then suddenly turned to face the reef wall, inflated her BCD 
and started to ascend. Her instructor grabbed a 'D' ring as there 

 
 
NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2012    
?BSAC - 2012   49 
was no rear dump on the BCD and dumped her own gas in an 
attempt to slow the ascent. On surfacing the student said she 
couldn't breathe but this was due to an over-inflated BCD and 
once some gas was released she was able to breathe easily. 
The student explained that she had got mucus and water in her 
mouth as a result of the leaking mask and didn't know if she 
could or should swallow it and had panicked but apart from the 
rapid ascent had suffered no ill effects. The instructor had 
bloodstained mucus in her mask, sinus pain and pain and 
deafness in her right ear. The pair swam on the surface to the 
entrance to the tunnel but because of surface traffic had been 
advised to swim back through the tunnel underwater. The 
instructor gave the student her spare mask which fitted and the 
pair descended to 6m and swam back underwater. On descent 
the pain in the instructor's sinuses and ear was relieved but 
returned after their final ascent. The pair did not dive again that 
day and went sightseeing the following day before flying home 
the next day with no further problems. The injury to the 
instructor was implicated in incident number 12/234. 
April 2012 12/123 
An instructor and a trainee entered the water and descended a 
shotline to a depth of 4m.  At this point the trainee experienced 
ear pain.  The instructor aborted the dive and brought the 
trainee to the surface.  Subsequent medical examination found 
no injury and the diver was able to continue with subsequent 
dives. 
April 2012 12/072 
During descent for a planned dive of 31 min to a maximum 
depth of 15m using nitrox 32, a student on a training course 
experienced difficulty clearing his ears at a depth of 12m. The 
student experienced severe pain in his left ear and signalled the 
problem to his instructor. The instructor terminated the dive and 
all three divers made a controlled ascent to the surface and 
were recovered to the boat. On returning to the shore the 
student sought medical advice and was diagnosed as having a 
perforated eardrum. 
August 2012 12/221 
A trainee diver  conducted a training dive to a maximum depth 
of 4m for 35 min. On surfacing the diver reported having 'pins 
and needles' in her hands which lasted for 10 min. This was 
attributed to a tight wetsuit seal and she stated that she often 
got 'pins and needles'. After a surface interval of 90 min the 
diver completed a training dive to a maximum depth of 6m and 
total duration of 40 min without incident. On surfacing the diver 
reported a pain in her chest. After de-kitting she reported 'pins 
and needles' in her hands and feet. The diver was taken into 
shade, laid down and given oxygen. Contact was made with a 
recompression chamber doctor for advice and, although initially 
advising DCI was unlikely due to the limited depths, the group 
were advised to take the student to hospital for assessment. At 
hospital the student declined blood tests and IV fluids. An ECG 
and chest x-ray were conducted and showed no abnormalities 
and the diver was discharged. The diver was advised not to 
dive again until passed fit by a diving doctor. 
September 2012 12/159 
Three divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 28m.  
Towards the end of the dive they started back to exit in the area 
of a sheltered cove.  But a current carried them away from the 
cove and into rough water.  They tried swimming underwater 
but made no headway.  At the surface they could not use 
snorkels because of the breaking seas.  They decided to swim 
to the nearest point on the shore.  Once there they were 
repeatedly thrown against jagged rocks and were unable to 
climb onto the shore.  Two divers eventually made it ashore and 
came back to assist the third.  The third diver had sought 
shelter in a small alcove, protected from the action of the sea, 
but was unable to climb out.  Their shore party had seen their 
plight and called the emergency services.  The trapped diver 
was eventually lifted to safety by a helicopter.  This diver was 
taken to hospital and treated for bad cuts to her hands.  Their 
diving equipment had protected them from more serious injuries 
from the rocks. 
 
 
Boating and Surface 
 
October 2011 12/006 
A coxswain covering three pairs of divers responded to another 
RHIB's coxswain who was waving for assistance. On moving 
alongside it was reported that the throttle handle had parted 
from the engine. The RHIB was taken under tow and the divers 
were subsequently recovered.  The disabled boat was towed 
back to harbour without further incident. The throttle handle was 
repaired by securing it in place with a locking screw and glue. 
The repair was effective for the remainder of the trip. 
October 2011 12/022 
A pair of divers entered the water from the shore for the third 
dive of the day, in late afternoon, intending to exit at dusk. 
There was a light swell as they entered over a rocky shore. The 
pair conducted an uneventful dive to a wreck at a maximum 
depth of 15m and a total dive duration of 54 min. Towards the 
end of the dive there was a noticeable swell at 9m and it was 
increasingly noticeable at 6m. On surfacing, a heavy swell could 
be observed hitting the shoreline. One diver attempted to exit 
and was picked up by a wave and thrown onto rocks by the exit 
point but managed to hold onto a rail provided. The second 
diver attempted to assist the first to remove her fins. Whilst 
doing this the second diver was picked up by a wave and 
smashed face down on the rock and then swept off back into 
the sea. The diver checked his mask and regulator for damage; 
both were intact and functioning.  The diver then exited the 
water and de-kitted himself and then went to assist his buddy 
from the water. The first diver lost her camera whilst in the swell 
as it broke away from the lanyard fixing. The second diver's 
camera was also damaged in the surf. Neither of the divers 
suffered injuries. 
 
 
Ascents 
February 2012 12/042 
A diver on holiday was on a trip to dive offshore pinnacles for a 
drift dive with expected multiple shark sightings. She was 
buddied with an instructor and her student who was on a deep 
dive speciality course. The dive plan was for the diver to 
accompany the instructor and her student to a maximum depth 
and then transfer to join the main dive group as the instructor 
was to descend to 40m for a training exercise. The diver 
entered the water but had problems with clearing her ears and 
took time to descend to 5m where the instructor and the student 
were waiting for her. The three then continued their descent 
with the diver concentrating on the instructor but aware of the 
group in her peripheral vision. The diver saw a signal for her to 
separate and join the main group and was mildly surprised, on 
checking her gauges, to find she was at 36m and the main 
group were no longer visible. She remained close to the 
instructor and they reached a maximum depth of 40m where 
they stabilised in a current. The instructor then began a DSMB 
deployment exercise with her student and the diver looked 
around to inspect the coral and fish life. The instructor was 
using a reel with 50m of line and due to the prevailing current, 3 
knots, on deployment she and her student were immediately

dragged up 10m so that when the diver turned back around she 
was alone and unable to see them. She ascended to 23m but, 
because she had not dived using a BCD for buoyancy before, 
she forgot to dump the expanding gas and had difficulty 
remaining at 23m and had to swim down. The diver saw a solo 
diver, a roving photographer from the main group, further along 
the reef and signalled her that all was not well but the diver 
turned and swam rapidly away. It later turned out she had been 
swimming in the direction of the main group but the diver had 
been unable to follow. The diver then made an uncontrolled 
ascent direct to the surface in 5-7 secs. On surfacing the 
photographer also surfaced and checked she was OK and then 
resumed her dive. The diver was recovered to the dive boat and 
placed on oxygen for 15 min. No ill effects were encountered. 
May 2012 12/124 
A diver under training conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 
14m.  At 6m he deployed a DSMB then he made a slow 
buoyant ascent to the surface.  Despite signals from his 
instructor he then re-descended to conduct his missed safety 
stop before surfacing normally.  His dive duration was 34 min.  
No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
May 2012 12/207 
A diver conducted a dive using nitrox 32, with her buddy, to a 
maximum depth of 27m and made a gradual ascent up the reef. 
After 25 min the pair were at 20m and reached the entrance to 
a tunnel which sloped steeply up. The pair had conducted the 
same dive the previous day and had been through the tunnel 
without incident. The diver had 80 bar of gas remaining and 
entered the tunnel first followed by her buddy. On exiting the 
tunnel at a depth of 12m the diver hit her cylinder valve on the 
roof of the tunnel and her contents gauge dropped rapidly to 
zero. Her buddy was behind her in the tunnel, was unaware of 
the problem and was not in a position to donate his alternate 
source, so the diver decided to ascend direct to the surface. 
Initially the diver was able to get some gas and so ascended 
slowly to around 5m before the gas delivery ceased and she 
made a faster than normal ascent, her computer indicating the 
ascent from 12m to the surface taking less than a minute. On 
surfacing the diver orally inflated her BCD and waved for 
assistance. An inflatable from the dive boat came to pick the 
diver up and she was able to signal her buddy from the surface 
that she was OK.  He completed his safety stops at 6m before 
surfacing and returning to the boat. The diver was kept under 
observation for 24 hours but suffered no ill effects. 
June 2012 12/090 
A diver conducted his second dive of the day.  He dived, with a 
dive leader, to 20m for 20 min.  The pair deployed a DSMB to 
make their ascent.  At 6m the diver commenced a rapid ascent 
to the surface.  At the surface he 'seemed rather flustered'.  He 
was placed on oxygen for 10 min and seem subdued.  On 
return to shore he had fully recovered and experienced no 
subsequent ill effects. 
August 2012 12/136 
An instructor and a trainee were on a dive to increase the 
trainee's experience of depth.  They descended a shotline to 
20m and then followed the seabed down to 33m.  Towards the 
end of the dive they made a slow, controlled ascent to 11m 
where the instructor deployed a DSMB.  Prior to this point the 
trainee's buoyancy had been good.  However, while the 
instructor was deploying the DSMB the trainee started to float 
upwards.  He was unable to stop himself being carried to the 
surface, missing a planned 3 min safety stop.  The instructor 
surfaced normally.  Both were safely recovered from the water.  
Neither diver had had less than 5 min no stop time left at any 
point in the dive.  No subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
September 2012 12/222 
Three students on an accelerated decompression course and 
their instructor conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 34m 
using nitrox 27. During descent the divers experienced very 
poor visibility of 2 to 3m, although they conducted a bubble 
check without problem.  On reaching a depth of 25m the 
visibility improved considerably. The dive and training drills 
proceeded without problems and the group started their ascent 
at the planned time of 28 min. At a depth of around 26 to 28m 
all four divers took up positions slightly apart to avoid 
entanglement and deployed their DSMBs. The instructor was 
level with one student whilst another was slightly above him and 
the third student slightly below. At 25m the instructor lost sight 
of the last two students as he entered the poor visibility zone 
but knew they had been in close proximity and was confident 
they would regroup on their decompression stop. As the pair 
approached their decompression stop at 6m the instructor had 
already switched to his decompression mix of nitrox 50 and his 
remaining student was just about to switch. The pair were 
suddenly dragged upwards. The instructor managed to control 
his ascent and regain control of his buoy line, his student let her 
reel go. The pair had been momentarily dragged up to 3m and 
so decided to extend their decompression stops by 6 min and 
surfaced after a total dive time of 40 min. The instructor 
surfaced to find the other two students in the cover boat and 
breathing oxygen from two separate oxygen sets onboard.  The 
deeper of the students had been using a finger spool for the 
DSMB deployment and he had stuck his gloved finger into the 
spindle hole of the spool instead of allowing it to spin free. 
During deployment this had created friction and the diver found 
himself being pulled upwards.  He was unable to control his 
drysuit and BCD during the ascent and made a fast ascent 
direct to the surface, missing decompression stops. The 
shallower student got his fin and ankle knife tangled on the 
buoy line of the deeper student as it was deployed and was also 
dragged to the surface in a fast, feet first, ascent as he was 
unable to reach his BCD controls. Both divers did switch to their 
decompression gas whilst awaiting recovery on the surface. 
During their fast ascent it is believed they snagged the lines of 
the instructor and the other student resulting in them being 
pulled upwards.  On the surface the instructor carried out a 
CNS examination of the two students on oxygen and found no 
signs or symptoms of DCI. A call had already been made to the 
local port authority and marine police in line with local practice. 
A police launch arrived shortly afterwards and transferred all 
three students back to harbour and on to hospital for treatment. 
The instructor remained onboard to assist with recovering a 
final pair of divers who were not part of the course. The three 
students were taken to hospital and, after having x-rays and 
blood tests taken, were transferred to a recompression chamber 
where they each received a 2 hour 15 min recompression 
treatment, all remained symptom-free. 
 
 
Equipment 
 
October 2011 12/019 
A pair of divers had conducted a first gentle drift dive to 16m for 
a maximum dive time of 45 min including a 3 min safety stop. 
One diver was using his own regulator and his buddy was using 
hired equipment. After a surface interval of 45 min the pair were 
joined by the dive centre owner for a second dive on a wreck at 
a maximum depth of 17m. After approximately 35 min the pair 
were asked for their cylinder pressures. The diver with the hired 
equipment showed the gauge to the dive guide at which point it 
exploded. The diver stopped to pick up the gauge whilst her 
partner picked up the console computer. The guide then 
provided his alternate source, which was taken by the diver who 
was a little confused as her regulator was still working well. The 

 
 
NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2012    
?BSAC - 2012   51 
guide then tried to put his thumb over the end of the high 
pressure gauge hose but was unable to stem the flow of gas. 
The group ascended to 6m where they conducted a 3 min 
safety stop. 
April 2012 12/071 
During a training dive, at a depth of 4m, a student was 
practicing for a alternate source ascent with another student, 
under the supervision of an instructor. He took the donor's 
alternate source and experienced a very wet breath and 
appeared to be uncomfortable. The instructor aborted the drill 
and the dive was terminated after a dive time of 46 min. On 
inspection the exhaust valve of the alternative source was 
found to have become inverted and was not making a seal; the 
fault was rectified. The student had practiced the same drill with 
the same equipment on a previous dive that day without 
problem. 
May 2012 12/125 
During a training course an instructor was demonstrating the 
mid-water deployment of a DSMB.  He heard a loud 'pop' and 
was surrounded by a mass of bubbles.   He discovered that the 
hose to his pony cylinder's pressure gauge had burst.  The dive 
was aborted and a safe ascent was made. 
June 2012 12/129 
A diver entered the water at the start of a dive.  An air leak was 
seen near the shoulder dump of his BCD.  The BCD was 
replaced and the dive continued normally.  Subsequent 
examination revealed a failure of a welded seam of the inner 
bladder of the BCD.  This fault was found on three other BCDs 
from the same manufacturer.  The manufacturer was informed 
and they instigated a recall. 
July 2012 12/130 
A dive was aborted when a diver's pressure gauge hose was 
seen to be leaking. 
September 2012 12/163 
A number of divers were engaged in a training event.  One diver 
lifted another from 20m using a controlled buoyant lift.  During 
the dive a small stream of bubbles were seen coming the 
diver's cylinder valve.  During the lift the 'O' ring blew out and a 
large air loss took place.  The diver took his buddy's octopus 
regulator and the buddy closed the cylinder valve.  They made 
a controlled ascent to the surface including a 3 min safety stop.
