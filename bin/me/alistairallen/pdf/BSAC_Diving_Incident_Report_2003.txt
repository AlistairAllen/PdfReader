Introduction 
 
This booklet contains the 2003 Diving Incidents Report, produced by The British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC) in the 
interest of promoting diving safety.  It is important to note that it contains details of UK diving incidents occurring 
to divers of all affiliations, plus incidents occurring worldwide involving BSAC members.  
 
Report Format 
The majority of statistical information contained within this report is also shown in graphical form.  Please note that all 
statistical information is produced from UK data only and does not include Overseas Incidents unless noted as ‘All 
Incidents’. 
 
The contents of this report are split into an overview of the year, and then the details of nine incident categories plus some 
historical analyses.  The various sections can be found as shown below:- 
 
 i) Overview Page  1 
 ii) Fatalities Page 5 
 iii) Decompression Incidents Page  7 
 iv) Injury / illness Page  18 
 v) Boating & Surface Incidents Page  22 
 vi) Ascent Problems Page  27 
 vii) Technique Problems Page  32 
 viii) Equipment Problems Page  34 
 ix) Miscellaneous Incidents Page  36 
 x) Overseas Incidents Page  37 
 xi) Numerical & Statistical Analyses Page  40 
 xii) List of Abbreviations Page  42 
 
 
Within each category the incidents are listed in the order of their occurrence, not necessarily that of Incident Reference.  
They are laid out in the following form: 
 
  MONTH/YR OF INCIDENT  INCIDENT REF.    
  Brief Narrative of Incident.................................................................................... 
  ........................................................................................................ 
 
The nature of many diving incidents is such that there is usually more than one cause or effect.  Where this is the case the 
incident has been classified under the more appropriate cause or effect. For instance an incident involving a fast ascent, 
causing decompression illness, will be classified under 'Decompression Incidents'.

Overview 
 
has seen a reduction in the total number of 
incidents that have been reported.  In the 2003 
incident year (October 02 to September 03 
inclusive) 392 incidents have been analysed, compared with 
432 in 2002, 458 in 2001, and 418 in 2000. 
There could be a number of reasons for this reduction:- 
• Firstly, that a lower percentage of incidents have been 
reported to the BSAC. 
• Secondly that less dives have taken place. 
• Thirdly that dive safety has genuinely improved.   
 
It seems unlikely that the first explanation is true since we have 
increasing links with other diving agencies, very good links with 
the emergency and rescue authorities, and an effective press 
cuttings service.   
A reduction in the amount of diving is a plausible explanation; 
our own membership numbers continue to reduce and we hear 
that other agencies have noted a reduction in diving activity.   
But I would also like to believe that we are succeeding in 
making diving safer and there is some evidence for this.  We 
have very high confidence that we record all UK incidents 
involving a fatality since these are high profile events and we 
get information on each one from several sources.  A 
comparison of the BSAC membership fatality rate shows a 
steady but clear improvement and I think it reasonable to 
assume that other categories of incidents share a similar trend. 
With the excellent weather that we have enjoyed this summer 
we might have expected more diving and more incidents not 
less.    
I strongly suspect that the reduction in reported incidents is a 
combination of the second and third factors.    
 
 
The distribution of reported incidents is shown in the following 
chart.  As can be seen, 67% of these incidents have occurred in 
the summer period.  This is totally consistent with previous 
years, reflecting the increased number of dives that take place 
during the warmer weather.

Incidents by category 
The incident database categorises all incidents into one of nine 
major categories, and the following chart shows the distribution 
of the 2003 incidents into those categories.  
 
The highest number of incidents relates to ‘Decompression 
Illness (DCI)' and this follows the trend of 2002 where DCI 
incidents took over from 'Boating and Surface' incidents as the 
largest group.  Nevertheless both of these have seen a 
reduction over previous years and it is the reduction in these 
two categories that accounts for the bulk of the overall reduction 
in reported incidents.   
‘Boating and Surface’ incidents have shown the greatest 
improvement.  These incidents mainly relate to engine failures 
and/or lost divers.  This year sees 81 such incidents reported 
and this is a 30% reduction over the typical levels of the last 5 
years.  The BSAC has repeatedly highlighted the importance of 
correct engine servicing and of carrying and using surface 
marker and detection aids to prevent divers from becoming 
separated from their boats; I think that it is fair to claim that 
people have responded to this advice and we are now seeing 
the benefits.

Fatalities 
The 2003 incident year has seen 11 fatal incidents in the UK, a 
significant reduction compared with the average of 16.3 per 
year over the last 10 years.  
 
The factors associated with these fatalities can be summarised 
as follows:- 
• Five cases involved depths greater than 50m.   
One involved solo diving and an out of breathing gas 
situation. 
One involved a rapid ascent and severe DCI. 
With the other three cases there was insufficient 
information to comment. 
• Four cases involved separation.   
In one of these cases the divers chose to separate. 
Two cases involve divers in difficulty who then became 
separated. 
One case involved divers who became separated during 
their ascent. 
• One case involved an accident with a trailer during the 
recovery of a diveboat. 
• One case where there is simply insufficient information to 
be able to draw conclusions. 
The penultimate case is arguably not a diving incident but it has 
been included since the casualty, whilst not actually diving at 
the time of the incident, was engaged in an activity directly 
associated with a dive trip.    
 
Finally there was one reported fatality overseas that indirectly 
involved a BSAC member.

The chart below shows the maximum depth of the dives during 
which incidents took place, summarised into depth range 
groupings. 
 
The pattern of depths in the 0 to 50m range is very similar to 
that normally seen and reflects the amount of diving that takes 
place in these depth ranges.  The  number of incidents reported 
in the greater than 50m range is 11 and this is lower than 
previous years.  However 5 of these 11 were fatal incidents, 
clearly indicating the risks associated with deep diving. 
  
The BSAC advises that no air dive should be deeper than 50m, 
and that dives to 50m should only be conducted by divers who 
are appropriately trained and qualified.   
The recommended limit for divers trained to Sports Diver 
standard is 35m and then only when they have received 
appropriate training for diving at this depth. 
The BSAC recommends that mixed gas diving should be to a 
maximum depth of 70m and then only when the diver holds a 
recognized qualification to conduct such dives.

The next chart shows the depth at which the incident started.  
Inevitably the data is biased towards the shallower depths since 
many incidents happen during the ascent or at the surface.  
Critical among these are the DCI cases where almost always 
the casualty is out of the water before any problems are noted.  
This partially explains the large occurrence of ‘Surface’ cases 
as this includes divers with DCI who have left the water. 
Other surface incidents involve boats and boating incidents.

Although the data suggest that divers at the level of Sports 
Diver are the most prone to problems one must be careful in the 
interpretation of these data.  The picture is clearly distorted by 
the numbers of members that we have at each of these grades.  
It is very probable that the largest single group of members are 
Sports Divers, hence the high incidence of problems.

An analysis of incident by diver qualification shows that no 
grade of diver, from novice to instructor, is immune to problems.  
It is all too easy to make the assumption that only inexperienced 
divers get into problems, but the chart shows that this is not so 
. 
The distribution of these qualification data conforms to the 
pattern seen in previous years. 
 
 
Divers’ use of the Emergency Services 
Divers’ use of the rescue services shows a monthly distribution 
aligned to the distribution of all incidents, and is clearly 
correlated with the number of dives that are taking place.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
Our demands upon the Coastguard service were in line with 
those of recent years.

Our call upon the RNLI in the 2003 incident year is very similar 
to that of 2002, which was down on previous years.  Over the 
four years previous to 2002 the RNLI was involved in an 
average of 120 incidents per year, in 2002 it was 95 and in 
2003 it was 94.

Incidents involving Lifeboats: 94  
 
 
 
Divers’ requirements for SAR helicopters continues to rise.  
Last  year recorded an increase, and the 2003 incident year has 
seen another significant rise.   
The average over the preceding five years was 92 recorded 
incidents involving a helicopter, this year it was 130 
 
Helicopters are tasked to support searches for missing divers 
and to transport divers with DCI to recompression facilities.  
Given the reduction in DCI and lost diver incidents that I 
reported earlier one would have expected to see a reduction in 
the need for helicopter assistance.   
Typically, over the last five years helicopters have been 
involved in 20 – 25% of reported incidents, this year it was 35% 
of reported incidents.   
It seems probable that we are seeing a general increase in the 
availability and use of helicopters for these tasks.   
 
Perhaps this aligns with and helps to explain the reduction in 
calls upon the RNLI.

Decompression Incidents 
The BSAC database contains 122 reports of DCI incidents in 
the 2003 incident year, some of which involved more than one 
casualty.  When these multiple cases are counted the result is 
132 cases of DCI. 
In 2002 168 cases of DCI were recorded, 116 in 2001, 134 in 
2000 and 86 in 1999.  
An analysis of the causal factors associated with these cases 
indicates the following major features:- 
33 involved repeat diving  
32 involved diving to deeper than 30m 
31 involved rapid ascents 
18 involved missed decompression stops  
Some cases involved more than one of these causes. 
 
The report includes several cases of ‘Diver illness’ reported by 
the RNLI and whilst the nature of this illness is not recorded by 
the RNLI it is very likely that these are further cases of DCI. 
 
As reported many times before, poor buoyancy control is at the 
heart of the majority of these cases.  Divers are failing to 
correctly control their ascent, especially in the critical last 10m 
zone and ending up with rapid ascents and/or missed 
decompression stops.  Very often the diver is using a drysuit 
and is unable to prevent a buoyant ascent. 
Divers continue to have problems with the deployment of 
delayed surface marker buoys – reels jam, equipment gets 
caught and divers are dragged to the surface.  The very piece 
of equipment that is supposed to increase the safety of an 
ascent is having just the reverse effect.   
This is an area where more training and practice is clearly 
needed. 
   
Two other factors that have contributed to DCI this year are:- 
• Dehydration – the hot weather has led to dehydration, 
compounded by divers in drysuits avoiding drinking 
because of the inconvenient consequences of doing so!  
However a trip to the loo, even in a drysuit, is quicker than 
a trip to the recompression chamber. 
• Multi-day dive trips – divers are neglecting to take the 
recommended mid-week break from diving and developing 
DCI as a result.

Conclusions 
Key conclusions are:- 
• The number of fatalities has reduced significantly.  Fatalities 
in the 2002 calendar year were 50% lower than in recent 
years.   
• Reported incidents are down over previous years indicating, 
in part, an improvement in diving safety. 
• There has been a continued reduction in the number of 
boating and surface incidents. 
• There has been a moderation in the number of incidents 
related to very deep diving, but there is still a clear and very 
strong correlation between increasing depth and increasing 
risk.  4 incidents involved depths of greater than 60m and 3 
of these were fatalities. 
 
Most of the incidents reported within this document could have 
been avoided had those involved followed a few basic principles 
of safe diving practice.  The BSAC publishes a booklet called 
'Safe Diving' (latest edition May 2002).  This booklet 
summarises all the key elements of safe diving and is available 
to all, free of charge, through BSAC HQ. 
 
Remember you can never have too much practice and the 
further you stay away from the limits of your own personal 
capabilities the more likely you are to continue to enjoy your 
diving. 
 
Please browse through the details in this report and use them to 
learn from others’ mistakes. They have had the courage and 
generosity to record their experiences for publication, the least 
that we can do is to use this information to avoid similar 
problems. 
 
Finally, if you must have an incident please report it on our 
Incident Report form, available free from BSAC HQ or via the 
BSAC website.   
 
As always, your anonymity is assured – great care is taken to 
preserve the confidentiality of any personal information 
recorded in BSAC Incident Reports.

Fatalities 
 
November 2002 03/009 
Two divers made a dive to 90m.  One of the divers was using 
trimix 10/52 and the other a rebreather.  At the end of the dive 
they ascended a line, with the rebreather diver above the other.  
At around 45m the trimix diver passed the rebreather diver and 
gave the 'OK' signal.  The rebreather diver then noticed a 'fuss 
on the line' above him.  He terminated his stops and ascended 
to 20m to check.  He saw no sign of the other diver and 
completed his stops.  At the surface he discovered that the 
other diver had not appeared.  After the planned dive time he 
raised the alert.  Police and Coastguard teams conducted a 
search using a thermal imaging camera but the missing diver 
was not found.  Plans were being made for a follow up search 
using an ROV. 
March 2003 03/062 
A pair of divers completed a dive to 55m and were conducting a 
decompression stop at a depth of 6m.  One of the divers was 
seen to convulse and sink rapidly.  His buddy was unable to get 
to him.  The Coastguard was alerted and an extensive search 
was conducted by a helicopter, a lifeboat and several other 
vessels.  The missing diver was not found.  The missing diver 
had been using trimix.  The buddy was taken to hospital 
suffering from shock.

April 2003 03/064 
Three divers conducted a dive to a wreck in a maximum depth 
of 30m.  During the ascent, at a depth of 20m, one of the three 
indicated that he was very low on air.  He commenced sharing 
air with the dive leader.  The third diver ascended to 20m and 
indicated, on two occasions, that she had a problem.  The 
sharing pair continued to the surface.  Their total dive time was 
12 min.  The third diver failed to surface.  The Coastguard was 
alerted and a search was organized involving two lifeboats, a 
helicopter, navy divers, other divers and other surface craft.  
The search was completed at dusk.  Further searches were 
planned by police divers. The missing diver's body was 
recovered approximately five weeks later.   It was reported that 
the weightbelts being used by the divers were prone to coming 
undone and that the divers had been told to tie them up. 
April 2003 03/065 
Two divers completed a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 
37m.  One of the pair completed his decompression stops and 
surfaced.  The other diver remained at the stop as he had a 
further 3 to 4 min of decompression to complete.  This second 
diver failed to surface.  A search was conducted involving two 
helicopters, two lifeboats and other craft but the diver was not 
found.  Underwater searches were also carried out with divers 
and an ROV in the following days but to no avail. 
May 2003 03/121 
A diver got into difficulties during a dive.  His buddy offered her 
alternative air source but it was refused.  The divers became 
separated and the buddy surfaced and raised the alarm.  
Another diver entered the water and found the casualty lying, 
unconscious, at a depth of 22m.  He brought the casualty to the 
surface and he was recovered into the boat.  Resuscitation 
techniques were applied and the diver was taken to hospital, 
where he was declared to be dead on arrival.   
(Newspaper report only). 
May 2003 03/122 
Two divers were diving solo on a wreck in a depth of 66m, both 
were using trimix.   One of the divers noticed the other deploy a 
delayed SMB and then give the 'out of air' signal.  He 
approached the diver and gave him his backup trimix regulator.  
They exchanged OK signals and started to ascend.  The diver 
giving air deployed a delayed SMB and switched on his nitrox 
32 supply as he was concerned about his trimix supply with two 
people using it. Between 50 and 45m his trimix ran out and he 
switched to nitrox 32 and made a fast ascent to 40m where he 
did a 2 min stop.  He noticed that the other diver was no longer 
with him but had no choice but to continue with his ascent.  He 
completed a series of decompression stops, including a switch 
to nitrox 70 at 12m.  He left the water with some decompression 
stops uncompleted and placed himself on oxygen.  He alerted 
the skipper that the other diver was possibly missing.  After the 
second diver's planned dive time had expired the emergency 
services were alerted and a helicopter and a lifeboat were 
tasked to assist.  The missing diver was not found. 
July 2003 03/148 
Two divers completed a wreck dive.  One of them deployed a 
delayed SMB and started to ascend.  Shortly into the ascent he 
checked for his partner but could not see him.  He stopped and 
looked around for the missing diver but he was not to be seen.  
He made a normal ascent.  At the surface it was determined 
that the second diver had not surfaced and the Coastguard was 
alerted.  A helicopter, two lifeboats and a ferry undertook an 
extensive surface search and divers searched underwater the 
following day, but the missing diver was not found. 
July 2003 03/149 
A group of seven divers were diving on a wreck at a depth of 
63m.  One diver surfaced missing all his decompression stops, 
a second diver surfaced missing half of his required stops, and 
a third diver failed to surface.  The two divers who had missed 
stops were airlifted to a recompression chamber.  The diver 
who had missed all his stops was declared to be dead on 
arrival.  An extensive search involving a helicopter and lifeboats 
was conducted for the missing diver.  The following day divers 
found his body, on the seabed, entangled in netting.

August 2003 03/166 
A diver experienced difficulties whilst at 20m and returned to the 
surface.  At the surface she was unconscious.  She was 
recovered from the water and resuscitation techniques were 
applied.  The Coastguard was alerted and a lifeboat and 
helicopter were dispatched to assist.  She was airlifted to 
hospital but declared dead on arrival. 
August 2003 03/165 
A group of divers were engaged in recovering an RHIB from the 
water.  The boat was on its trailer and was being towed up a 
narrow track by a tractor.  Some divers were in the boat and two 
others rode on the back of the tractor standing on a footplate.  
During a gear change the tractor lurched and one of the divers 
fell from the back of the tractor.  She fell under the wheels of the 
trailer.   She received severe injuries and died at the scene.

Dive boat calls to report that it has diver aboard suffering from 
suspected DCI, airlifted to recompression facility for treatment.  
(Coastguard report). 
October 2002 03/048 
A diver dived to 17m for 28 min with a 1 min safety stop at 6m.  
2 hours later he undertook a second dive to conduct controlled 
buoyant lift training.  The dive plan was to dive to 6m.  He dived 
with an instructor and a buddy to act as the casualty.  They 
made their descent and the trainee continued down to 12m 
where the instructor caught him up and stopped him.  They 
returned to the surface where the instructor re-briefed them.  
They dived to 6m and the trainee conducted the lift.  The trainee 
over-inflated the casualty's BCD and they made a rapid ascent.  
The instructor managed to slow the ascent a little but they 
continued to the surface.  No further diving was conducted that 
day.  The trainee noted discomfort in his shoulder but put this 
down to carrying heavy equipment.  The following day the 
symptoms had worsened and he now had some numbness.  He 
sought medical advice and reported to a recompression facility 
where he received treatment for DCI. 
October 2002 03/258

October 2002 03/037 
Two divers made a dive to a maximum depth of 35m.  When 
one of the divers was down to 50 bar they prepared to deploy a 
delayed SMB.  One of the divers started to fill the buoy with her 
alternative air source which then began to free flow.  The other 
diver ditched the SMB and attempted to stop the free flow.  
Whilst doing so, the diver with the free flow attempted to take 
his regulator.  He tried to reach his own alternative air source 
but was prevented by the other diver's struggles.  He could see 
that she still had her own regulator in place and so he pushed 
her away, assuming that she could still breathe.  The diver with 
the free flow then began to panic and rushed for the surface, 
the other diver attempted to slow the ascent, but they were 
joined by a buddy line and they both made a rapid ascent to the 
surface.  The dive duration was 28 min.  They were recovered 
into their boat and placed on oxygen.  The Coastguard was 
alerted and the divers were airlifted to a recompression facility 
for treatment.  Subsequent investigation revealed a blown 'O' 
ring in the swivel connector of the diver's alternative regulator.  
Narcosis was felt to have been a contributing factor. 
October 2002 03/260 
Report from DDRC Derriford, diver complained of feeling 
unwell, suspected DCI, ambulance and fire tender administered 
oxygen.  Diver later transferred by ambulance to DDRC for 
treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
October 2002 03/255 
Dive boat reports two divers surfaced missing 35min of stops, 
third diver with chemical burns from object picked up on the 
seabed.  Medi link established, all divers airlifted to hyperbaric 
chamber and burns unit.  (Coastguard report). 
November 2002 03/023 
A diver made a dive to 7m for 28 min.  2 hours later she dived 
again; this time to 20m for 24 min.  The second dive profile 
included a very slow ascent to 6m after 12 min.  The following 
day she experienced 'pins and needles' in her back.  That 
afternoon she attended hospital.  She was given oxygen, placed 
on a drip and taken to a recompression facility.  She received 
two sessions of recompression therapy. 
November 2002 03/032 
A pair of divers descended to a wreck which was lying on a 
slope.  They reached the deepest part of the wreck at 42m and 
then tied a distance line to the wreck and continued down the 
slope towards 50m.  They disturbed silt and this reduced 
visibility.  The dive leader indicated that they should return.  At 
this point the reel jammed and he released his torch so that he 
could use both hands to recover the line.  His buddy tried to 
help but this hindered the dive leader.  The buddy then began to 
feel anxious and began to breathe rapidly.  He took hold of the 
dive leader and tried to pull him towards the surface.  Their 
struggle reduced visibility further.  The dive leader pushed the 
buddy away and recovered his torch.  When the dive leader 
found his buddy he was lying motionless, on the bottom, 
tangled in the line, but with his regulator in his mouth.  The dive 
leader put air into the buddy's BCD and cut the lines to release 
the tangle.  They made an uncontrolled, rapid ascent during 
which the dive leader lost his grip on the buddy.  When the dive 
leader reached the surface he saw his buddy at the surface, 
motionless and face down.  Another dive boat went to assist.  
Divers from this boat entered the water to help.  The 
unconscious diver was recovered into his group's boat.  He 
recovered consciousness and was placed on oxygen.  The dive 
leader was assisted from the water and he too was placed on 
oxygen.  The Coastguard was alerted.  The buddy had pain in 
his arms and vomited.  Both divers were airlifted to 
recompression facilities for treatment.  Both were discharged, 
symptom free, the following day. 
November 2002 03/035 
A pair of divers descended to 23m.  They then re-ascended to 
18m at which point one of the pair heard a loud sound of air 
being released.  Her regulator began to free flow and would not 
supply the full amount of air.  Her buddy offered his alternative 

  NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2003

air source which she took.  Because of her lack of air she was 
not able to clear this mouthpiece and could not breathe.  She 
put her original regulator back in her mouth.  She was 
struggling to breathe and beginning to panic.  Her buddy 
brought her to the surface.  At the surface she blacked out 
briefly.  She was helped from the water and placed on oxygen.  
She then felt aches in her joints and reported to a 
recompression chamber.  Both divers received treatment and 
made a full recovery. 
December 2002 03/036 
A diver completed two 20 min dives to a depth of 35m.  The 
following day he repeated these dives with a 3 hour surface 
interval.  On the last dive he made a 1 min stop at 6m.  Later 
that evening he noticed a pain in his elbow and shoulder.  He 
sought medical advice and was recompressed.  This did not 
resolve the symptoms.  The diver was advised not to dive for six 
weeks. 
December 2002 03/091 
Two pairs of divers entered the water to conduct a dive to 48m.  
One of the divers' drysuit split on entry and he aborted his dive.  
The buddy of this diver descended with the other pair.  At the 
bottom he did not stay with the other divers.  He returned to the 
shot to begin his ascent.  He was using a twin-set with separate 
regulators to each cylinder.  He changed to the other regulator 
at the start of his ascent.  This regulator began to free flow.  He 
managed to stem the free flow but had only 35 bar left in that 
cylinder.  He ascended the shotline and started his planned 
decompression stops.  However with 21 min of stop time 
remaining at 3m he ran out of air.  He surfaced, gave the 
distress signal, and was recovered into the boat.  He was 
placed on oxygen and given fluids.  He was on oxygen for 67 
min and showed no signs of DCI.  The next morning he woke 
with a pain in his shoulder and neck; this area was the site of a 
previous injury.  He sought medical advice and reported to a 
recompression chamber.  He received a series of five 
recompression treatments and the pain was resolved. 
January 2003 03/265 
Following a call from ambulance control, it transpired a dive 
vessel was proceeding to harbour with a diver aboard suffering 
from suspected DCI.  Transferred by air ambulance to hospital.  
(Coastguard report). 
January 2003 03/049 
The Coastguard was alerted when three divers surfaced 
missing decompression stops.  The divers were transferred to 
an inshore lifeboat and taken to a recompression facility.  One 
diver received recompression treatment and the other two were 
kept in hospital for observation.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
February 2003 03/051 
A diver conducted a dive to 41m for a duration of 38 min with a 
5 min stop at 18m and a 4 min stop at 6m.  2 hours 14 min later 
he dived again.  His second dive was to 26m for 35 min with a 3 
min stop at 6m.  During his drive home he felt pain developing 
in both his arms.  He sought medical advice and was referred to 
a recompression facility where he received treatment.  His 
buddy conducted the first dive with trimix and used nitrox 50 for 
decompression and he experienced no problems. 
March 2003 03/061 
A trainee diver was on his fifth dive.  Less than 5 min into the 
dive, at a depth of 20m, his regulator began to free flow.  His 
instructor brought him to the surface using his alternative air 
source.  After 30 min the trainee began to feel very unwell and 
was placed on oxygen.  He was taken by helicopter to a 
recompression facility where he received treatment.  The water 
temperature was 5 deg C. 
March 2003 03/069 
A diver completed a 24 min dive to a depth of 12m.  Back on 
the boat she felt that she was becoming sea sick.  Once back 
on the shore she felt dizzy and had trouble walking.  Sea 
sickness was still considered to be the cause.  She was placed 
on oxygen.  She felt very dizzy when she moved her head.  
Medical advice was sought.  1 hour after surfacing she was still 
unwell and the oxygen supply was exhausted.  She was taken 
to hospital where she was again placed on oxygen.  7 hours 
later there were no signs of improvement and diving medical 
advice was sought.  An inner ear problem was diagnosed and 
she was airlifted to a recompression facility for treatment.  The 
following day she received a further recompression treatment 
and made a full recovery.  A DCI of the inner ear was 
suspected. 
March 2003 03/205 
A diver conducted a 20 min dive to 10m.  Later he dived to 25m 
for 20 min.  30 min later he noticed a pain in his arm.  He was 
placed on oxygen and he went to a hospital.  He was airlifted to 
a recompression facility where he received recompression 
treatment and made a full recovery. 
March 2003 03/073 
Three divers were 12 min into a dive at their maximum depth of 
21m.  At this point the cylinder of one of the divers slipped out 
of its clamp and his regulator was pulled from his mouth.  He 
froze.  His buddies realized the problem and one of them gave 
his alternative air source.  The diver without the regulator did 
not breathe.  His buddies brought him to the surface and raised 
the alarm.  The diver was recovered from the water, he was not 
breathing and resuscitation techniques were applied.  He was 
placed on oxygen and airlifted to hospital.  An embolism was 
suspected and two sessions of recompression treatment were 
planned.  It was noted that the casualty had new equipment 
with 12 kg of weight in his BCD weight system plus a 7 kg 
weightbelt and ankle weights.  It was also noted that he used 
two, different, medical inhalers. 
March 2003 03/110 
Whilst on a training dive, at a depth of 22m, a diver's regulator 
began to free flow.  His buddy offered her alternative air source 
but he was shocked and unable to respond.  The buddy 
ensured that he had air and attempted to lift him with a 
controlled buoyant lift.  However the free flow prevented her 
from putting air into his BCD so she lifted him using her own 
BCD to initiate the ascent.  Their dive time was 15 min.  Once 
out of the water the condition of the diver with the free flow 
deteriorated and he was placed on oxygen.  He was airlifted to 
a recompression facility where he was treated for mild 
symptoms of DCI.  He made a full recovery. 
March 2003 03/080 
Two divers were at a maximum depth of 20m when the 
regulator of one of the pair began to free flow.  They made a 
normal ascent.  The diver with the free flow seemed unharmed 
but complained that the air flow had 'burned' the back of his 
throat.  Later that day the diver became unwell and sought 
medical advice.  He subsequently received recompression 
treatment.  The water temperature was 5 deg C. 
March 2003 03/086 
Two divers completed a dive to 44m.  Their dive time was 28 
min including a 5 min stop at 6m.  Shortly after getting back into 
the boat, one of the divers became unresponsive.  She was laid

©BSAC -2003  9 
down and the Coastguard was alerted.  The oxygen kit had 
been left ashore.  The diver's condition deteriorated, she 
became short of breath and had blurred vision.  The helicopter 
was estimated to be 45 min away and so the boat headed back 
to harbour.  In the harbour they were met by a lifeboat and 
oxygen was administered.  The diver started to vomit.  She was 
transferred by ambulance and helicopter to a recompression 
facility.  The diver was recompressed.  Following this treatment 
she was still nauseous and unsteady.  She was kept in hospital.  
By the following morning she had lost feeling and movement in 
her legs.  She was placed on a course of recompression and 
oxygen therapy over a three week period, after which she could 
walk with crutches but had no feeling in her legs.  Treatment 
continued. 
April 2003 03/100 
A diver completed a 27 min dive to a maximum depth of 11m.  
Most of the dive was between 4 and 6m.  Her previous dive was 
22 hours earlier.  After the dive she noted that her hands were 
tingling.  Her drysuit was removed and she was placed on 
oxygen and given fluids.  Medical advice was sought and the 
casualty was taken to a recompression chamber where she 
received treatment.  Her symptoms responded to the treatment.  
She was transferred to hospital and stayed there overnight.  
She then began a train journey home.  During this journey her 
symptoms returned.  She attended a hospital and was given an 
anti-inflammatory injection which caused her arm to go 
completely numb.  She was taken to a recompression facility 
where she received two further treatments over two days.  It 
was stated that the casualty's mild asthma was a causal factor 
and a PFO was suspected.  Further tests were planned. 
April 2003 03/063 
Two divers undertook a shore dive to a maximum depth of 15m.  
After 27 min, at a depth of 9m, one of the divers experienced air 
migration into the legs of his drysuit.  He managed to regain an 
upright posture but was unable to prevent a rapid ascent to the 
surface.  His buddy followed at a normal rate. The buddy 
assisted the diver to the shore.  He was placed on oxygen and 
medical advice was sought.  The Coastguard was contacted 
and the casualty was taken by helicopter to a recompression 
facility  where he received a series of recompression 
treatments.  His buddy went with him but he was not 
recompressed.  The diver was using a drysuit which he had 
borrowed for the dive. 
April 2003 03/277

May 2003 03/123 
A diver completed a 40 min dive to a depth of 38m.  This 
included 9 min decompression at 5m plus a further 4 min safety 
stop at 3m.  1 hour after the dive he noted that his left shoulder 
was red and itchy.  The diver was placed on oxygen and the 
emergency services were alerted.  The diver was taken by 
lifeboat to a recompression facility where he was treated for 
DCI. 
May 2003 03/113 
Two divers descended to a depth of 35m.  At this point one of 
the pair panicked and went for his buddy's alternative air 
source.  His buddy managed to get them both to the surface 
although their ascent was fast.  Their total dive time was 3 min.  
At the surface the buddy shouted for help.  The casualty was 
recovered from the water.  He could remember nothing of the 
incident and was uncommunicative.  He was placed on oxygen 
and the emergency services were contacted.  The diver was 
taken by helicopter to a recompression facility.  He received 
one recompression treatment and was discharged the following 
day. 
May 2003 03/096 
Two divers conducted a 30 min dive to a maximum depth of 
22m.  During the ascent one of the divers complained of a 
problem with her ears and needed to be assisted to the surface 

  NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2003

by her buddy.  The diver was taken to hospital for investigation 
of the ear problem.  Some time after her release from hospital 
she complained of numbness in her hands and she received 
recompression treatment. 
May 2003 03/300 
Following a call to Coastguard, diver transferred by ambulance 
to recompression chamber for treatment suffering from 
suspected DCI.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2003 03/109 
Two divers were 10 min into a dive to 18m when one of the pair 
panicked and went to her buddy for his alternative air source.  
The buddy got them to the surface and towed the panicked 
diver to the side of the quarry, giving AV as he did so.  Other 
assistance arrived.  The casualty was taken by helicopter to a 
recompression facility where she received two treatment 
sessions.  It was reported that the panicked diver was nervous 
and inexperienced, had a very tight semi-drysuit, and had been 
coerced into the dive by her buddy.  She suffers from asthma 
and is a smoker. 
May 2003 03/146 
Two divers conducted a training dive to a depth of 17m.  At the 
bottom, one of the divers lifted the other to 6m using a 
controlled buoyant lift.  They then re-descended and practiced 
some navigational skills.  They then stopped in a depth of 15m 
and practiced mask clearing and regulator sharing.  They ended 
the dive with the other diver conducting a controlled buoyant lift 
to the surface.  At the surface she completed the rescue 
practice.  1 hour 32 min later they dived again.  This time they 
dived to 18m and again practiced navigational skills.  After 37 
min they again practiced air sharing and then mask removal.  
During this exercise one of the divers inhaled water up her nose 
which caused her to experience breathing difficulties.  She tried 
to cough.  She found that she could breath out but not in.  He 
buddy held her nose for her but this did not help.  The troubled 
diver pushed off the bottom to swim to the surface.  Her buddy 
inflated her BCD and they made a rapid ascent to the surface.  
At the surface she quickly recovered.  Later that night she 
noticed that she had blurred vision but thought that it was due 
to her contact lenses and tiredness.  Early the following 
morning she noticed a rash on the left side of her waist, over 
her right bust and at the bottom of her spine.  Later she 
developed a pain in her left shoulder.  The pain got worse and 
she sought medical advice.  She reported to a recompression 
facility and was treated for DCI. 
May 2003 03/116 
A diver who was suffering from DCI was transported by 
helicopter and ambulance to a recompression chamber for 
treatment.  (Newspaper report only). 
May 2003 03/302 
Dive support craft reported having a diver aboard suffering from 
suspected DCI, airlifted to recompression facility by Coastguard 
helicopter.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2003 03/124 
A diver completed a dive to a maximum depth of 22m for a 
duration of 51 min.  1 hour later he dived to 18m for a duration 
of approximately 40 min including a 3 min stop at 3m.  After this 
dive he complained of a migraine and when asked he stated 
that he had a small pain in his side.  His right hand grip was 
found to be significantly less strong than his left.  He was given 
water and placed on oxygen and the emergency services were 
alerted.  The boat returned to the harbour and the diver was 
taken by ambulance and helicopter to a recompression facility 
where he received a long series of recompression treatments.  
It is reported that this diver had been diving without a hood and 
that he was dehydrated as he had drunk little because he was 
diving in a drysuit which was difficult to get into.  The diver was 
subsequently tested for a PFO and a small hole was found. 
May 2003 03/307 
Diver recovered to DDRC suffering from itching and red 
blotches, no further details at present.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2003 03/310 
Dive leader called Coastguard reporting having a diver on 
oxygen suffering from suspected DCI, airlifted by Coastguard 
rescue helicopter to recompression chamber for treatment.  
(Coastguard report). 
May 2003 03/309 
Following a dive to 48m diver complained of feeling unwell 
aboard diving vessel, patient given oxygen and airlifted to 
hyperbaric chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2003 03/167 
A diver completed a series of six dives over a three day period.  
On the last day her only dive was to 35m for 32 min.  About 90 
min after surfacing she noticed a rash and some itching across 
her back.  She was placed on oxygen for 21 min and her 
symptoms resolved.  After a 5 min break she was placed on 
oxygen again for another 18 min.  The Coastguard was alerted 
and the casualty was brought ashore and then taken by 
ambulance to a recompression facility where she received a 
precautionary recompression treatment. 
May 2003 03/313 
Retrospective report of diver suffering cerebral DCI, made to 
Coastguard by relative of patient.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2003 03/207 
A pair of divers conducted a dive to 24m.  After 15 min one of 
the pair deployed an SMB and they started their ascent.  At 
11m the diver with the SMB lost control of his buoyancy and 
was carried to the surface in 20 seconds.  His buddy surfaced 
normally.  At the surface both were recovered into the boat.  
The diver who had made the rapid ascent developed a 
headache.  When this worsened he was placed on oxygen and 
the Coastguard was alerted.  The diver was airlifted to a 
recompression facility where he received a precautionary 
recompression treatment.  He suffered no subsequent ill 
effects.  It was subsequently determined that the buoyant 
ascent occurred because the diver had closed the auto dump 
on his drysuit. 
June 2003 03/319 
Diver having completed a dive to 39m missing total of 20 min of 
stops, was placed on oxygen as a precaution, and airlifted to

missed stops and was showing signs of DCI, subsequently 
airlifted to recompression facility by RAF helicopter.  
(Coastguard report). 
June 2003 03/132 
A diver completed two dives in a day.  Between the two dives 
she laid in the sun.  After the second dive she noted a skin rash 
but assumed that this was the effects of the sun.  The following 
day she dived to 27m for 30 min with a 3 min stop at 6m.  1 
hour 47 min later she dived to 25m for 31 min.  After the first of 
these dives she noted a sharp pain in her shoulder.  After the 
second dive she had a severe pain in her shoulder, felt unwell 
and 'was itchy'.  She also found a red, white and blue rash on 
her upper body and her upper right arm was severely swollen.  
She sought medical advice, was placed on oxygen and then 
taken by helicopter to a recompression facility.  She received a 
series of recompression treatments over a six day period.  She 
was left with a sore back, neck and shoulders.  A spinal DCI 
was diagnosed. 
June 2003 03/152 
A diver completed a dive to 22m for 38 min with a 4 min stop at 
6m.  5 hours later she dived again, this time to 19m for 41 min 
with a 5 min stop at 6m breathing nitrox 50 during the stop.  The 
following day, 18 hours later, she dived to 23m for 40 min with a 
5 min stop at 6m.  Later, back on shore her right shoulder 
began to prickle and then hurt.  After a delay of 45 min she 
breathed oxygen for 1 hour.  The pain eased significantly.  She 
drank 1.5 l of water and made a 4 hour drive home.  The 
following day she sought medical advice and was told that she 
should have been recompressed when the initial symptoms 
appeared.  As it was 24 hours later she declined recompression 
treatment and the symptoms remained for a further two days.  It 
was suggested that this diver might have a PFO.  In hindsight 
she reports two previous instances of itching and painful 
mottled skin that may also have been minor cases of DCI. 
June 2003 03/140 
A diver conducted a dive to 8m for 34 min.  Later that day he 
dived to 14m for 28 min.  The following day he dived to 47m for 
24 min with a 2 min stop at 9m and a 5 min stop between 6m 
and 3m.  After this dive he felt slightly sick and was unsteady on 
his legs.  His symptoms remained but, after a surface interval of 
4 hours 22 min, he dived again; this time to 25m for 30 min.  At 
the end of the day he walked up a 150m hill and noticed that 
the unusual feeling in his legs remained.  During the night he 
suffered cramp in his legs and the following day he noticed a 
soreness around his ribs.  He felt unwell and breathed oxygen 
for 15 min.  Later that morning he dived to 10m for 20 min.  He 
still felt unwell and so he contacted a recompression chamber 
and was advised to attend for examination.  He was diagnosed 
with a spinal DCI and received a series of eight recompression 
treatments over a 7 day period.  He planned to be tested for a 
PFO. 
June 2003 03/316 
Dive support vessel put out a 'Mayday' call requesting 
assistance for a diver suffering from suspected DCI following a 
rapid ascent from 36m.  The diver was airlifted to 
recompression chamber by Coastguard rescue helicopter R-I.

June 2003 03/142 
A dive support vessel called the Coastguard to report that they 
had two divers aboard who had made a rapid ascent from 30m. 
Although no symptoms were present, following medical advice 
the divers were airlifted by an RAF helicopter to a 
recompression facility.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2003 03/317 
Dive support vessel reported having a diver aboard suffering 
symptoms of DCI, after consultation with hyperbaric chamber 
doctor, vessel was met by Coastguard and ambulance at 
Queen Alexandra Battery, transferred to chamber for treatment.  
(Coastguard report). 
June 2003 03/153 
A diver completed a 25 min dive to 36m with a 2 min stop at 
6m.  4 hours 22 min later he dived again to 32 m for 28 min with 
a 2 min stop at 6m.  The following day, 19 hours 30 min later, 
he dived to 35m for 31 min with a 2 min stop at 6m.  2 hours 30 
min after surfacing from this dive he complained of a damp 
feeling to the skin on the inside of his left forearm.  90 min later 
he experienced numbness.  He was placed on oxygen and 
medical advice was sought.  The diver received recompression 
treatment and his symptoms resolved. 
June 2003 03/154 
A diver completed a 27 min dive to 35m with a 2 min stop at 
6m.  4 hours 18 min later he dived again to 24 m for 37 min with 
a 2 min stop at 6m.  The following day, 18 hours 30 min later he 
dived to 34m for 35 min with a 1 min stop at 9m and a 2 min 
stop at 6m.  2 hours after surfacing from this dive he reported 
feeling tired and a skin rash was found on his left shoulder.  He 
was placed on oxygen and medical advice was sought.  The 
casualty received recompression treatment and his symptoms 
resolved. 
June 2003 03/326 
Following a 999 call received, diver reported suffering from 
suspected DCI, was subsequently airlifted to recompression 
chamber for treatment.  The diver had conducted a 20 min dive 
to 36m.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2003 03/169 
A diver conducted a dive to 27m.  During the dive he lost 
contact with his buddy.  He looked around for him and then 
started his ascent.  He moved to the top of the wreck and 
deployed a delayed SMB.  Whilst doing this he heard air being 
released from somewhere, he could see no bubbles.  He began 
his ascent.  He was unable to control his buoyancy and made a 
rapid ascent to the surface.  His dive time was 33 min.  It is 
thought that the inflator valve on his BCD had been allowing air 
into the BCD in an uncontrolled manner.  He was recovered into 
the boat and placed on oxygen.  He began to experience pain in 
his right shoulder, calves and knees.  He was airlifted to a 
recompression chamber for treatment. 
June 2003 03/168 
A diver conducted a dive to 29m.  She began her ascent when 
her computer indicated 11 min of decompression at 3m.  She 
ascended to 6m and stopped for 2 min, she then spent a further 
11 min at 3.5m, switching to nitrox 32 for the final 5 min.  She 
left the water and the boat returned to shore.  She assisted with 
unloading kit and then noticed a rash appearing on her stomach 
and a visual disturbance in her left eye.  She was placed on 
oxygen and contact was made with a recompression facility.  
She was taken to the recompression facility and received a 7 
hour treatment for a neurological DCI. 
June 2003 03/170 
A diver completed a 30 min dive to a depth of 30m with a 3 min 
stop at 6m.  6 hours later he dived to 33m for 28 min with a 6 
min stop at 6m.  Once ashore he removed his drysuit, which 
had been leaking, and went to help recover the boats.  He then 
noticed a tingling and numbness in his left foot and upper leg.

He was placed on oxygen.  The local recompression facility was 
contacted and the diver was taken there for examination.  He 
was found to be in good health although he was told that he had 
had a DCI. 
June 2003 03/212 
Two divers completed a 22 min dive to 29m.  6 hours 22 min 
later they dived again to 29m for 36 min.  The following day they 
dived to 28m.  Towards the end of the dive they deployed a 
delayed SMB to begin their ascent.  The bag burst and they 
reeled it in and deployed a second SMB.  This took more time 
than planned and they started their ascent with 13 min of 
decompression stops indicated.  During the ascent one of the 
pair lost control of his buoyancy and ascended directly to the 
surface.  Another diver entered the water to join the buddy 
whilst he completed his decompression stops.  Both divers 
were airlifted to a recompression facility where recompression 
treatment was given. 
June 2003 03/330 
Following a series of dives, a diver, suffering from DCI, reported 
to local doctor.  The diver was subsequently airlifted to 
recompression facility by Coastguard helicopter.  (Coastguard 
report). 
June 2003 03/331 
Dive support vessel reported having a diver aboard suffering 
from suspected DCI following a dive to 58m for 23 min and 
having missed 30 min of stops due to equipment malfunction.  
(Coastguard report). 
June 2003 03/185 
A diver completed an 81 min dive to 49m with a 2 min stop at 
22m, a 4 min stop at 9m, a 23 min stop at 6m and a 3 min stop 
at 3m.  He used nitrox 80 from 9m to the surface.  5 hour 2 min 
later he dived again.  His second dive was to 32m for 71 min 
with a 2 min stop at 12m, a 1 min stop at 9m, a 7 min stop at 
6m and a 3 min stop at 3m.  Again, he used nitrox 80 from 9m 
to the surface.  After the second dive he experienced a pain in 
his right bicep whilst passing a gas cylinder into the boat.  Once 
in the boat the condition worsened and he was placed on 
oxygen and given water to drink.  The emergency services were 
alerted and he was airlifted to a hospital and then taken by 
ambulance to a recompression facility.  Recompression 
resolved his symptoms.  He had had a previous skiing injury to 
this arm and this may have contributed. 
June 2003 03/332 
Dive support vessel met by Coastguard and ambulance, as the 
vessel came alongside, following a report of a diver aboard 
feeling unwell, taken to recompression facility for treatment.  
(Coastguard report). 
June 2003 03/418 
A diver completed a 29 min dive to 32m including a 3 min safety 
stop at 6m.  20 min after surfacing he developed symptoms of 
DCI on the skin and in the joint of his shoulder.  He was placed 
on oxygen and taken by lifeboat to a recompression facility 
where he received treatment.  He made full recovery.  
Dehydration is thought to have been a contributory factor. 
June 2003 03/159 
A diver completed a 38 min dive to 28m with a 2 min stop at 
6m.  4 hours 19 min later she dived again to 28m for 30 min 
with a 2 min stop at 6m.  The following day she dived to 17m for 
37 min with a 2 min stop at 6m.  On the journey home she 
noticed some tingling in her fingers but discounted DCI.  She 
awoke the following morning with 'pins and needles' in her left 
hand; the sensation lessened and she returned to bed.  Later 
that day she sought medical advice and attended a 
recompression chamber.  She received three sessions of 
recompression therapy and the symptoms resolved. 
June 2003 03/133 
A diver completed a series of eleven dives over a period of six 
days.  These dives ranged between 12m and 38m with 
durations from 23 min to 37 min.  Only one of these dives 
involved decompression.  One the sixth day he dived to 25m for 
26 min and then to 17m for 34 min with a 3 hour 34 min surface 
interval.  The following day he made a 10 hour journey home.  
Towards the end of this journey he felt pain in his left elbow and 
some numbness in his left forearm.  The symptoms became 
apparent when he had not moved his arm for some time.  The 
following morning the symptoms remained and he sought 
medical advice.  He attended a recompression facility where a 
suspected minor DCI was diagnosed.  He was recompressed 
and released the following day symptom free.

A diver conducted a series of four dives over a two day period.  
The first dive was to 36m for 36 min including a 9 min stop at 
6m.  After an interval of 2 hours 7 min he dived to 14m for 38 
min including a 3 min stop at 6m.  During this second dive he 
came to the surface briefly part way through the dive to take a 
compass bearing.  The following day after 21 hours 22 min he 
dived to 33m for 38 min including an 8 min stop at 6m.  After 
this dive he had to swim hard to get to the boat.  Finally, after 
an interval of 1 hour 58 min, he dived to 25m for 26 min.  He did 
not make any stops on this last ascent.  During this ascent his 
computer gave two ascent rate warnings.  During his drive 
home he noticed a 'swimming' sensation in his head and a 
slight discomfort in his right elbow and left shoulder.  The 
following day he woke up with a tingling sensation in his hands 
and shooting pains in his elbows and at the front of his left 
shoulder.  The following day he awoke with worse symptoms.  
He sought advice and was referred to a recompression 
chamber where he received two sessions of recompression 
treatment. 
July 2003 03/186 
Three divers undertook a dive to a maximum depth of 24m. 

NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2003                          
©BSAC -2003  13 
After 25 min they deployed a delayed SMB to make their 
ascent.  No stops were indicated on their computers.  One diver 
had only 40 bar remaining.  They ascended to 12m at which 
point the diver who was low on air started to have a problem 
venting his drysuit and they rose to 7m before he regained 
control.  They re-descended to 14m to restart the ascent.  
When they reached 10m again the diver who was low on air 
took the alternative air source of one of the others.  These two 
divers then rose to the surface missing an indicated 2 min 
decompression stop.  The third diver surfaced normally.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and the divers were airlifted to a 
recompression chamber.  One of the divers who had missed 
stops lost the strength in one arm and had 'pins and needles' in 
his fingers.  Both were recompressed and the symptoms 
resolved. 
July 2003 03/162 
A diver conducted a 24 min dive to a depth of 30m with a 4 min 
stop at 9m and a 3 min stop at 6m.  1 hour 39 min later she 
dived to 20m for 37 min with a 1 min stop at 9m and a 3 min 
stop at 6m.  After this second dive she complained of a pain in 
her shoulder.  She thought that this was the result of a muscle 
strain sustained whilst getting back into the boat.  Once back on 
shore she examined her arm and found it to be red and 
blistered.  The diver was laid down and placed on oxygen.  
Advice was sought from the local recompression chamber and 
the diver was taken in for examination.  The diver had seven 
sessions of recompression therapy.  It was thought that the 
diver might have a PFO. 
July 2003 03/419 
A diver suffering from DCI was taken by helicopter to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  (Newspaper report only). 
July 2003 03/338 
Dive support vessel called to report that they had a diver, 
suffering acute pain following a rapid ascent from 21m.  She 
had previously dived to 63m same day, the diver was airlifted to 
recompression chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2003 03/164 
Two divers conducted a 48 min dive to a maximum depth of 
43m including a 6 min stop at 6m and a 16 min stop at 4m.  The 
divers carried a total of three computers and they did not 
surface until the last had cleared.  Once out of the water one of 
the pair reported an increasing pain in his back and a tingling in 
his legs.  He was placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was 
alerted.  The diver was airlifted to a recompression facility 
where he was treated for a neurological and vestibular DCI. 
July 2003 03/172 
A diver completed a series of seven dives over a period of a few 
days.  On the day before the incident he dived to 38m for 56 
min which included a 20 min stop at 4m.  5 hours 37 min later 
he dived to 42m for 63 min including a 12 min stop at 4m.  The 
following day he dived to 49m for 82 min which included a 40 
min stop at 4m.  Later that day, once back on shore, he 
experienced soreness in his arm and noticed a rash.  He was 
placed on oxygen and taken to a recompression facility where 
he received recompression treatment. 
July 2003 03/239 
A diver received recompression treatment after developing DCI. 
July 2003 03/175 
A diver on a training course commenced a dive.  During the 
descent his buddy had a problem and they made a fast ascent 
from 12m.  The diver then re-descended and completed a dive 
to 34m.  The following day he dived to a depth of 20m.  After 
this dive he developed symptoms of DCI.  He was taken to a 
recompression facility where he received treatment. 
July 2003 03/343 
Dive support vessel reported having a diver aboard suffering 
from suspected DCI, whilst being administered oxygen, 
Coastguard helicopter R-IJ airlifted casualty to recompression 
chamber for treatment.  The diver had conducted a dive to 35m 
for 25 min and then to 33m for 28 min.  (Coastguard report).

Dive support vessel reported having a diver aboard suffering 
from suspected DCI, airlifted to DDRC by Royal Navy 
helicopter.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2003 03/248 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 26m.  
They then followed a reef which sloped gently upwards.  After 
16 min one of the divers thought that he had been stung around 
the mouth by a jellyfish and he took the regulator from his 
mouth, wiped his mouth with his hand and then replaced the 
regulator.  He did this a number of times.  They swam back to 
their starting point where the troubled diver experienced a 
headache.  His buddy signaled the ascent and they made a 
slow ascent to the surface.  Their total dive time was 27 min.  
Once back in the boat he was placed on oxygen and taken to 
the shore.  The Coastguard was alerted and the diver was 
taken by helicopter to a recompression facility.  The diver 
received recompression treatment and this resolved his 
symptoms. 
July 2003 03/344 
Following a call from a dive centre, a diver was reported to be 
suffering from DCI, was given a medi link call to doctor and 
subsequently transferred to recompression chamber for 
treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2003 03/173 
Two divers were at 54m when one of the pair experienced a 
regulator free flow.  He took the alternative air source of his 
buddy and they began their ascent.  At 40m the buddy's 
regulator began to free flow.  The diver whose regulator first 
free flowed had an unmanifolded twin-set and he returned to his 
own air supply at 25m.  His buddy had only 25 bar remaining 
and she surfaced slowly, missing 5 min of decompression 
stops.  The other diver conducted 2 min of decompression 
stops and surfaced.   They swam to a platform to get out of the 
water.  Whilst his buddy was helping him from the water the 
diver who had experienced the first free flow became 
unconscious and went underwater.  His buddy got him to the 
side and summoned help.  He was recovered from the water 
and placed on oxygen.  After 10 min he recovered 
consciousness and he was found to have symptoms of DCI   He 
was taken to a recompression chamber for treatment.  The 
other diver suffered no ill effects. 
July 2003 03/345 
Two divers were at a depth of 28m when one of the pair ran out 
of air.  Her buddy offered his alternative air source but it was 
not accepted.  The diver then made a rapid ascent to the 

  NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2003

surface, where she was narrowly missed by a hardboat which 
was operating on the site.  She was recovered into a boat and 
placed on oxygen.  She and her buddy were taken to the shore 
and another boat collected other divers from the group.  The 
diver and her buddy were airlifted to a recompression facility for 
treatment. 
July 2003 03/250 
A diver had conducted a series of dives over a period of seven 
consecutive days.  On the last day he dived to 34m for 40 min.  
4 hours later he dived to 26m for 40 min with an 11 min 
decompression stop at 6m.  Very early the following day he 
awoke with an ache in his arm and in the morning he 
complained of dull and shooting pains in his arm.  He was 
placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  The diver 
and his buddy were airlifted to a recompression facility where 
the diver with symptoms was treated for a suspected DCI.  He 
was discharged, fit, the following day. 
July 2003 03/347 
Following a dive at 12:00, diver sought medical advice at 20:00 
having completed a 53m dive 21 min, taken by private means to 
hospital suffering from suspected skin bend.  (Coastguard 
report). 
July 2003 03/183 
A diver completed a series of dives over a five day period.  On 
the last day he dived to 42m for 35 min with a 2 min stop at 6m 
and an 8 min stop at 3m.  2 hours 25 min later he dived again.  
This second dive was to 33m for 41 min with a 6 min stop at 
3m.  During the return boat trip he complained of feeling unwell 
and of diarrhea.  He felt seasick and lay down at the back of the 
boat.  Others monitored his condition.  He experienced 
continual stomach cramps.  Once ashore he attempted to walk 
but felt dizzy, sick and very weak.  He was placed on oxygen 
and medical advice was sought.  He was taken to a 
recompression facility and fluids were given.  He received 
recompression treatment.  A stomach infection and severe 
dehydration were identified as contributing factors. 
July 2003 03/240 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 26m for a 
duration of 40 min.  After this dive she noticed a slight ache in 
her left hip joint.  After a surface interval of 2 hours she 
conducted a second dive very similar to the first.  After the 
second dive she again noticed the ache in her hip.  1 hour 30 
min later the ache worsened and then became a stabbing pain.  
She sought medical advice and attended a hospital.  She was 
placed on oxygen and, after a 1 hour wait for an ambulance, 
she was transported to a recompression facility.  On the way 
the ambulance broke down and a further 45 min wait ensued 
before a replacement arrived.  She received four sessions of 
recompression treatment over a three day period and made a 
full recovery.  She was advised to arrange a 
July 2003 03/197 
Two divers conducted a dive to 15m for 40 min including a 2 
min safety stop at 6m.  Three hours later they dived again.  
During their descent, at a depth of 9m,  the dive leader 
accidentally let go of the SMB.  The divers ascended to the 
surface, collected the SMB and swam back to the shotline.  
They re-descended but at 3m one of the pair had problems 
clearing his ears so they aborted the dive.  Their total dive time 
was 7 min.  Once back in the boat the diver's ear cleared but he 
was then seasick.  The following day the diver noticed a pain in 
his elbow joint and a numbness in his fingers.  He sought 
medical advice and reported to a recompression facility.  He 
was recompressed and this resolved his symptoms. 
July 2003 03/421 
Two divers conducted a dive to 45m.  They surfaced, low on air, 
having missed decompression stops.  Both divers exhibited 
signs of DCI and were airlifted to a recompression facility for 
treatment. 
July 2003 03/184 
Two divers completed a dive to 32m for 27 min and they 
conducted a safety stop at 6m.  2 hours later they dived again.  
Their second dive was to 22m.  Towards the end of the dive, 
one of the pair spotted a weight that someone else had lost.  He 
picked it up.  He put extra air into his suit to support the weight.  
At about 19m he dropped the weight and his buoyancy began to 
carry him to the surface.  Struggling to retain control he ran out 
of air and managed to switch to his alternative source.  His 
buddy hung on to him trying to control the ascent but at 14m he 
had to let go and the buoyant diver made an inverted ascent to 
the surface where his suit was fully inflated.  Both divers left the 
water.  25 min later the diver who had made the buoyant ascent 
rapidly went into a decline.  The emergency services were 
alerted and an ambulance attended the scene.  The casualty 
was then airlifted to a recompression facility where he was 
successfully treated for a neurological DCI. 
July 2003 03/187 
Two trainees and an instructor conducted a training dive.  They 
completed two ascents from 6m using an alternative air source.  
They dived to 14m and one trainee lifted the other using a 
controlled buoyant lift.  At the surface he towed the other 
trainee for 25m.  They then conducted compass drills at the 
surface. One of the trainees then left the water and the other 
trainee descended with the instructor to practice a controlled 
buoyant lift from 6m.  This was aborted as the trainee could not 
clear her ears.  Their total dive time was 1 hour 6 min.  2 hours 
15 min later the trainee who first left the water and the instructor 
dived again.  They descended to a maximum depth of 16m then 
spent half the dive at a depth of 6m.  Their dive time was 20 
min.  Later that evening the trainee who had made the second 
dive noticed a tingle in his hand and contacted a recompression 
facility.  He attended the facility and was recompressed.  It is 
thought that dehydration may have been a contributing factor. 
August 2003 03/188 
Two divers completed a 44 min dive to 30m with a 12 min stop 
at 3m.  2 hours 7 min later they dived to 24m for 28 min with a 2 
min stop at 3m.  The following day, 15 hours 28 min later, they 
dived a third time.  This dive was to 35m.  After a dive time of 
17 min they deployed a delayed SMB and started their ascent.  
Their computers indicated that a 4 min stop was required.  At 
28m the weightbelt of one of the divers fell off.  He tried to get 
back down to it but was unable to do so as his legs filled with 
air.  He made a buoyant ascent to the surface and his buddy 
went with him.  They were recovered into the boat and placed 
on oxygen.  At the surface one of the divers' computer indicated 
18 min of missed stops.  The Coastguard was alerted and both 
divers were airlifted to a recompression facility.  One diver was 
showing signs of DCI and both were recompressed.  The 
symptoms resolved. 
August 2003 03/218 
A diver completed a 65 min dive to a maximum depth of 21m, 
including a 6 min stop at 5m.  1 hour 52 min later he dived 
again.  His second dive was to 23m for 58 min including a slow 
18 min ascent from 20m at the end.  After this dive he became 
ill and was taken to hospital.  From hospital he was transferred 
to a recompression facility and received a series of four 
treatments for DCI.  It was a hot day and the diver may have 
been dehydrated.

Two divers completed a dive to 30m.  After 27 min they started 
their ascent.  One of the divers attempted to deploy a delayed 
SMB but the reel jammed.  He tried to get another reel out of 
the pocket of his buddy's BCD but in doing so he knocked the 
regulator from her mouth.  This diver replaced her regulator but 
was now breathing hard and starting to panic.  During this 
period the divers were ascending and distressed diver was 
unable to control her buoyancy.  She rose to the surface in less 
than 2 min, missing decompression stops.  Her buddy remained 
to complete his stops although, once back in the boat, he was 
found to have missed 1 min of decompression stop.  The 
Coastguard was alerted.  The divers were placed on oxygen 
and medical advice was sought.  The divers were airlifted to a 
recompression facility where they both received recompression 
treatment. 
August 2003 03/354 
Dive support vessel reported having two divers aboard suffering 
from suspected DCI, both airlifted by rescue helicopter to 
recompression chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2003 03/242 
A diver completed a 34 min dive to 34m including a 4 min safety 
stop at 6m.  3 hours 30 min later she dived again to 25m for 55 
min including a 6 min safety stop at 6m.  15 min after this dive 
she noticed that her upper arms were sore; she thought that 
this was due to pulled muscles.  1 hour later she developed a 
migraine which lasted for 30 min.  3 hours later she noticed that 
her upper arms were covered in a blotchy red and white, 
marbled rash.  The following day she sought medical advice.  
The rash had gone but her arms were still sore.  She attended a 
recompression facility and received treatment for a skin DCI.  
She was tested for a PFO but none was found. 
August 2003 03/360 
Dive support vessel reported having a diver aboard with 
suspected DCI, patient was airlifted to hyperbaric chamber for 
treatment.  Note: had there been a delay of half an hour the 
patient may well have been paralyzed.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2003 03/223 
A diver completed a 39 min dive to a depth of 36m, including a 
1 min stop at 15m, 11 min at 6m and 1 min at 3m.  Her 
computer only indicated a total of 8 min stops but extra safety 
stops were conducted.  1 hour later, back on shore, she 
removed her diving suit and noticed an itchy, bruised feeling on 
her left arm.  These symptoms began to spread and she was 
placed on oxygen and medical advice was sought.  She was 
taken to a recompression facility.  The symptoms had spread 
across her shoulders and down her right arm, and similar 
symptoms appeared at the top of both her legs.  Her arms were 
also swollen.   A skin and lymphatic DCI were diagnosed and 
she received three sessions of recompression therapy.

Dive support vessel contacted Coastguard reporting having a 
diver aboard suffering from suspected DCI, patient and buddy 
were airlifted to hyperbaric chamber for treatment.  Hull 
Coastguard team supported.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2003 03/202 
Two divers conducted a dive to 31m for a total of 59 min 
including 5 min at 9m and 8 min at 6m.  One diver was using 
nitrox 25, the other was using air and their decompression 
schedule was for air.  After a surface interval of 3 hours 55 min 
they made a second dive.  They both dived using air to 29m for 
43 min including 4 min at 9m and 6 min at 6m.  Once back in 
the boat the diver who had made the first dive on nitrox helped 
to recover the anchor.  24 min after surfacing this diver 
complained of a pain in his left upper arm but put this down to 
lifting the anchor.  Later that day he noticed a rash and a 
marbled blueness on his upper arm.  He was placed on oxygen 
and the rash began to reduce.  Medical advice was sought and 
the diver was taken to a hospital.  He was placed on a drip and 
transported on oxygen, by ambulance, to a recompression 
facility where he received recompression treatment.  His 
symptoms resolved. 
August 2003 03/203 
Two divers conducted a 25 min dive to a maximum depth of 
33m with a 3 min stop at 6m.  2 hours later they made a drift 
dive to 16m for 54 min.  3 hours later one of the pair noticed 
minor pains and 'twinges' in his elbows, knees, shoulders and 
particularly his left wrist.  These symptoms persisted for two 
days and on the third day the diver sought medical advice.  He 
was examined at a recompression facility and received 
recompression treatment which resolved his symptoms.  This 
diver had previously suffered from a similar DCI.  This diver has 
Addison's disease. 
August 2003 03/362

helicopter and ambulance were tasked, however the diver 
refused medical assistance, all units returned to normal duties.  
(Coastguard report). 
August 2003 03/228 
A diver conducted a dive to a depth of 27m.  She was using a 
newly purchased BCD which was thought to be the same as the 
one on which she had trained.  However the direct feed hose 
was shorter and, as a result, the fill and dump valve was higher 
than she was used to.  During the ascent she was unable to 
find the dump valve and she made an uncontrolled, rapid, 
ascent to the surface.  Her total dive time was 20 min.  She was 
placed on oxygen and taken ashore.  Medical advice was 
sought and she was taken to hospital.  She was then taken to a 
recompression facility and treated for a suspected DCI. 
September 2003 03/237 
Two divers conducted a dive to 40m.  After 28 min they both 
deployed delayed SMBs to make their ascent.  One of the pair 
was diving with an extra T shirt and fleece under his undersuit.  
Prior to deploying the SMB this diver dumped air to make sure 
that he was negatively buoyant.  He started to ascend and 
found that he was too heavy and he let air into his BCD.  He 
then realized that he was ascending too quickly and attempted 
to reach the hose of his BCD.  He took three attempts to find 
the hose and dump the air.  His ascent continued and he tried 
to dump air from his suit but none was released.  He pulled at 
his neck seal, but was unable to prevent a buoyant ascent to 
the surface.  He ascended from 32m in just over 1 min.  He was 
recovered into the boat and placed on nitrox 50.  His dive 
computer indicated 30 min of missed decompression.  His 
buddy completed 20 min of decompression stops.  The 
following day the diver who had made the buoyant ascent 
experienced a numbness of his shoulder, elbow and leg.  He 
attended a recompression facility and received two 
recompression treatments over a two day period. 
September 2003 03/374 
Dive support vessel reported having a diver aboard with 
suspected DCI, diver and buddy airlifted to recompression 
facility for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2003 03/425 
A trainee diver was carrying out a mask clearing exercise.  The 
mask did not seal correctly and she made several attempts to 
clear it.  Then she started to panic and swam for the surface.  
Her instructor attempted to slow the ascent but they still 
surfaced faster than normal.  At the surface the diver was 
hyperventilating, she complained of a headache and did not 
seem fully alert.  She was recovered from the water and placed 
on oxygen.  The emergency services were alerted and she was 
airlifted to a recompression facility where she was treated for a 
suspected embolism.  (Newspaper report only). 
September 2003 03/249 
A diver completed a 30 min dive to 32m including a 10 min stop 
at 6m.  8 min later the diver began to feel unwell.  He was 
placed on oxygen and taken by ambulance to hospital.  After 2 
hours in hospital he was discharged.  He still felt unwell and 
sought specialist medical advice by phone.  He was advised to 
attend a recompression facility where he received 
recompression treatment.  He subsequently received a series of 
three treatments at another recompression facility. 
September 2003 03/376 
Doctor called Coastguard requesting assistance to evacuate 
diver with suspected DCI to recompression chamber for 
treatment, transferred by ambulance to air ambulance for the 
journey.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2003 03/234 
A diver completed a 42 min dive to 28m including a 3 min stop 
at 6m.  She was breathing nitrox 30.  45 min after surfacing she 
experienced blurred vision, dizziness, a loss of balance, nausea 
and vomiting.  She was taken to hospital and from there she 
was taken by ambulance to a recompression facility.  She was 
on oxygen and a saline drip during the journey.  She received a 
series of recompression treatments over the next four days for 
a vestibular DCI. 
September 2003 03/253 
A diver completed a 22 min dive to a depth of 26m.  20 min 
after surfacing he experienced 'pins and needles' in his legs.  
He was placed on oxygen and returned to shore.  He was taken 
by ambulance to a recompression facility where he received 
recompression treatment.  It was reported that this diver had 
not eaten or drunk properly for at least 14 hours prior to the dive 
and dehydration is thought to have been a factor in the DCI. 
September 2003 03/254 
A diver completed a series of thirteen dives over a consecutive 
seven day period.  Depths ranged from 13m to 39m and 
durations from 28 min to 61 min.  On the seventh day he dived 
to 28m for 35 min with a 3 min stop at 6m.  3 hours 16 min later 
he dived to 27m for 44 min with a 3 min stop at 6m.  29 hours 
after this last dive he became aware of an itching across his 
back.  He went to a recompression facility where he was 
recompressed for a skin DCI.  He reported that he had noticed 
itching earlier but had been preoccupied by an unrelated issue. 
September 2003 03/378 
Dive support vessel reported having a diver aboard suffering 
from suspected DCI, with a doctor recommendation diver 
evacuated by air with Coastguard helicopter, and taken to 
recompression chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2003 03/426 
A diver completed a dive to 36m for 38 min including a 13 min 
stop at 3m.  2 hours 40 min later he dived to 27m for 24 min 
including a 7 min stop at 3m.  During the ascent from this 
second dive, this diver became separated from his buddy and 
he surfaced 12 min before him.  Once back in the boat he 
complained of a stiff right shoulder and 10 min later accepted 
oxygen.  The casualty thought that his problem was a strained 
muscle.  20 min later he stopped taking oxygen.  He became 
very seasick.  2 hours later he arrived back on shore, but he 
continued to be sick.  The casualty was found to be 
disorientated and unable to walk properly.  The Coastguard was 
alerted and the casualty was airlifted to a recompression facility.  
He received a series of recompression treatments over the 
following eight days.  A vestibular DCI was diagnosed and the 
casualty had a residual hearing loss in one ear, four weeks after 
the event. 
September 2003 03/379 
Dive support vessel reported having a diver aboard who had 
made a rapid ascent from 6m.  As symptoms developed the 
casualty was airlifted by Coastguard helicopter and transferred 
to hospital by land ambulance.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2003 03/383 
Dive support vessel made urgency call to Coastguard 
requesting assistance for diver suffering from suspected DCI.  
Returned to port to be met by ambulance, taken to 
recompression chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard report).

Lifeboat launched to help diver with illness.  (RNLI report). 
October 2002 03/261 
Following a dive to 24m for 20min, diver with suspected DCI.  
Diver and buddy were airlifted by Coastguard helo to Poole 
recompression chamber, where his symptoms were diagnosed 
as not diving related.  Treated in an A&E hospital.  (Coastguard 
report). 
October 2002 03/011 
A diver was using his left hand and arm to steady himself as he 
left the water from a dive in a quarry.  In doing so he suffered a 
dislocated arm.  This arm had been previously dislocated eight 
years ago. 
October 2002 03/020 
An instructor and a trainee made a dive to 6m for 23 min.  2 
hours 30 min later they dived again, this time to a maximum 
depth of 5m to conduct controlled buoyant lift training.  During 
the descent the student experienced problems clearing her ears.  
Once clear they descended to 5m and the student lifted the 
instructor to the surface.  At the surface she complained of pain 
in her left ear and she was distressed.  After 1 min the pain 
ceased and they left the water.  The student reported that the 
pain started in the last half metre of the ascent.  She complained 
that her ear felt 'full' and that her hearing was impaired.  Later 
blood was seen coming from her ear.  The following day she 
attended hospital and a perforated eardrum was diagnosed. 
November 2002 03/025 
A pair of divers conducted a dive to 20m for a duration of 25 min.  
After the dive one complained of shoulder pain and a slight rash.  
Medical advice was sought.  The diver was placed on oxygen.  
The diver then explained that he had suffered an injury from a 
fall 14 days earlier.  The diver was taken to a recompression 
facility but extensive testing indicated that he did not have a DCI. 
November 2002 03/003 
Two divers completed a dive to 20m for 40 min.  90 min later 
they dived again.  One of the pair had twin cylinders charged 
with nitrox 32.  He had 100 bar remaining from the first dive and 
used this for his second dive.  They agreed that he would lead 
the dive and ascend when he got to 50 bar.  They dived to 20m.  
After a while, the dive leader indicated that they should head 
back.  Shortly afterwards the dive leader took the alternative air 
source of his buddy.  The dive leader then took the jacket inflator 
of the buddy and they started a controlled buoyant ascent.  
There was no warning given but both divers were relaxed.  
Suddenly, during the ascent, the dive leader's head snapped 
back and the regulator came out of his mouth, he let go of his 
buddy and started an uncontrolled descent.  He grabbed for his 
pony regulator which contained 100% oxygen.  The buddy 
followed the dive leader to the bottom.  The dive leader was lying 
on the bottom, moving and breathing erratically.  The buddy 
offered his alternative air source but the dive leader did not seem 
to notice.  The buddy tried to inflate the dive leader's BCD but 
nothing happened.  Because of the dive leader's movements the 
buddy could not release his weightbelt.  He took hold of the back 
of his BCD, inflated his own BCD and attempted to lift him.  He 
was was too heavy to lift.   
The buddy ascended and called for help.  He then tried to re-
descend but his own breathing became very erratic and he had 
to resurface.  Other divers recovered the dive leader.  
Resuscitation was applied and the diver was taken to hospital 
where he was placed on a life-support machine.  The dive leader 
had been using a new BCD.  The casualty regained 
consciousness approximately four weeks later and is reported to 
be recovering. 
November 2002 03/014 
Three divers conducted a shore dive.  One of the group 
experienced breathing difficulties.  All three made a rapid ascent 
to the surface.  The diver with breathing difficulties was placed 
on oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  All three were taken 
to by helicopter to a recompression facility.  (Coastguard report). 
November 2002 03/026 
Three divers conducted a 24 min dive to a depth of 20m.  3 
hours later one of the three suddenly developed a headache.  He 
was placed on oxygen.  The pain slowly subsided but he felt 
slightly nauseous, cold and 'jittery'.  The Coastguard was alerted 
and medical advice sought.  He was advised to attend a hospital, 
from where he was referred to a recompression facility.  Tests at 
this facility concluded that the diver did not have a DCI.  The 
effects were thought to be due to a build up of carbon dioxide.  
The diver was kept in hospital for observation and released the 
following day. 
November 2002 03/027 
Two divers completed a 31 min dive to a depth of 21m.  They 
planned to leave the water using a steel ladder on a pontoon.  
The first diver removed her fins, placed them on the pontoon and 
climbed out.  She then bent to pick up her fins and slipped on the 
wet surface.  She fell back into the water hitting her thighs and 
arm on the side of the pontoon.  Her buddy, who was still in the 
water, helped her out.  Two days later she was suffering from 
some stiffness and bruising but the condition was improving. 
November 2002 03/028 
A trainee diver was conducting a dive to 6m.  6 min into the dive 
she began to panic.  Her buddy brought her to the surface where 
she convulsed and had difficulty breathing.  She was removed 
from the water and placed on oxygen.  The emergency services 
were alerted and the diver was taken to a recompression facility.  
She was recompressed as a precaution, but it was considered 
that she had had a convulsion as a result of a panic attack.  It 
was subsequently discovered that this diver had a history of such 
attacks, but had not declared this. 
November 2002 03/029 
A diver made a stride entry into the water at the beginning of a 
night dive.  She had a torch on a lanyard attached to her right 
arm and it is believed that this torch struck her arm.  This diver 
suffered from rheumatoid arthritis and had had recent 
reconstructive surgery on her arm.  She thought that her right 
elbow had been damaged by the impact.  She was taken by 
ambulance to hospital and a fracture of the lower right arm was 
diagnosed. 
 
December 2002 03/038 
A diver was removing equipment from a swimming pool storage 
cupboard when a cylinder fell forward.  He was unable to move

out of the way and the pillar valve struck his foot.  A ambulance 
attended the scene. 
December 2002 03/386 
Lifeboat launched to help diver with illness.  (RNLI report). 
February 2003 03/046 
Two divers were preparing for a dive.  They entered shallow 
water but one had difficulty fitting his fins so he walked back to 
the shore where he managed to fit them.  Whilst re-entering the 
water he tripped and fell.  He landed on one knee.  This knee 
was badly injured, and the diver required surgery and twelve 
weeks convalescence. 
March 2003 03/058 
A diver conducted her first ever dive using a semi drysuit in 
water at 5 deg C.  She dived with an instructor to a maximum 
depth of 6m for a duration of 20 min.  After the dive she was 
found to be on the verge of hypothermia for which she was 
treated.  She made a good recovery. 
March 2003 03/070 
Two divers descended slowly to a depth of 19m.  After 5 min, 
one of the pair experienced a sharp pain across his eyes.  He 
ascended quickly.  He suffered no further ill effects but reported 
that he had been under stress for a number of weeks and had 
had two sleepless nights. 
March 2003 03/098 
A trainee and an instructor conducted a 20 min dive to a 
maximum depth of 6m.  At the start of the dive, the trainee had 
failed to turn on the cylinder valve sufficiently and this had not 
been noted during buddy checks.  The partially open valve 
provided increased breathing resistance and the trainee strained 
her intercostal muscles in her efforts to breathe.  The dive was 
terminated when the trainee's gauge showed 50 bar.  Back in the 
boat the cylinder was turned on correctly and the gauge then 
read 140 bar.  The following day the issue was discussed and 
medical advice was sought.  The trainee was taken to hospital by 
ambulance and advised not to dive for at least 10 days. 
March 2003 03/275 
Ambulance control reported receiving a call from member of the 
public of a diver in difficulties, rescue helicopter R-WB 
scrambled, casualty airlifted to hospital.  Symptoms were of 
drowning and not DCI therefore taken to A&E.  (Coastguard 
report). 
April 2003 03/099 
A trainee was ascending from a dive to 8m.  At 6m she lost 
control of her buoyancy and rose rapidly to the surface before 
the instructor could assist.  At the surface the trainee dumped air 
and rapidly descended to rejoin the instructor.  The trainee was 
somewhat unresponsive to signals and held her hand over her 
ear.  The instructor brought her to the surface with a controlled 
buoyant lift and they abandoned the dive.  Some hours later the 
trainee complained of blood coming from her ear.  She was 
examined by a local doctor and a perforated eardrum was 
diagnosed.  The trainee had been recovering from a cold and 
was taking Sudafed.  She had dived successfully for several 
days before this event. 
April 2003 03/083 
Two divers completed a 26 min dive to a maximum depth of 
21m.  They spent the last 3 min at 6m.  The dive began with a 
long surface swim.  Upon surfacing one of the divers was sick.  
Once out of the water the diver was sick once more.  It was 
finally concluded that the diver had suffered from food poisoning. 
April 2003 03/089 
A trainee and an instructor dived to a depth of 25m.  At this point 
the trainee looked uncomfortable and, in trying to clear his mask, 
ended up with it above his nose.  His instructor brought him to 
the surface using a controlled buoyant lift.  The dive duration was 
15 min.  Once out of the water, the trainee was placed on 
oxygen.  He was taken by ambulance to hospital and a series of 
tests were conducted on him.  He was found to be suffering from 
a fast heart rate and low blood oxygen levels.  An underlying 
health problem was suspected. 
April 2003 03/135 
An RHIB was maneuvered stern first into a beach and stopped in 
a depth of about 1.5m.  As divers prepared to board the boat a 
3m high wave approached.  Warnings were shouted to the cox.  
The wave grew to a height of 5m and lifted the boat vertically.  
The cox was thrown out of the boat which was then hit by a 
second large wave.  The boat landed upside down on top of the 
cox with the A frame buried into the sandy beach.  The cox 
surfaced in an air pocket under the boat and then managed to 
escape to join the other members of the party.  The cox 
sustained an injury to his lower back.  The Coastguard was 
alerted and the casualty was taken by helicopter to hospital 
where a cracked or broken rib was diagnosed.  The boat was 
recovered but some equipment was lost. 
April 2003 03/107 
A diver was 20 min into a dive, at a depth of 20m.  He 
experienced an shooting pain in his left knee.  He made a 
controlled ascent.  The knee was found to be swollen and 
'locked'.  He was advised to see his doctor. 
April 2003 03/101 
An instructor completed two training dives; the first to 6m for 30 
min and the second, 1 hour later, to 6m for 25 min.  She left the 
water after the first dive by climbing a ladder and she noted that 
her left leg felt weak and her left hip felt as if it was going to give 
way.  Her leg became progressively weaker and she had great 
difficulty leaving the water after the second dive.  She had 
significant weakness in her leg and she had numbness and 
tingling in her left leg and foot.  The following day she sought 
medical advice and a damaged disc in the lumbar vertebrae was 
diagnosed.  This diver had suffered a previous back injury. 
May 2003 03/295 
Ambulance control called Coastguard for assistance, following 
diver reporting buddy having become unconscious underwater 
after losing mouthpiece.  Casualty taken by ambulance to 
hospital for treatment (near drowning).  (Coastguard report). 
May 2003 03/191 
A diver undertook her first dive in UK waters.  She started her 
descent and immediately her mask began to flood.  She cleared 
the mask but it flooded again.  Her buddy attempted to help her.  
The mask continued to flood and she let go of the buoyancy 
control system of her BCD which she had been holding.  She 
then took hold of her alternative air source by mistake and tried 
to use this to dump air from her BCD.  Realizing the mistake she 
struggled to find the buoyancy control which had moved out of 
place.  She eventually found the control and experienced further 
problems in releasing air.  Finally she managed to dump air and 
descended quickly to the seabed at a depth of 12m.  She 
experienced pain in her ears.  She began to panic and her buddy 
tried to calm her down.  Another diver realized that there was a 

  NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2003 
20        ©BS-AC - 2003 
problem and used a controlled buoyant lift to get her back to the 
surface.  She was recovered into the boat and blood was seen 
coming from one of her ears.  The Coastguard was alerted and 
the boat returned to the shore.  The diver was taken to hospital 
and a badly inflamed eardrum was diagnosed. 
May 2003 03/114 
Two divers completed an 18 min dive to a depth of 35m.  One of 
the pair made a fast ascent from 6m to the surface.  He 
complained that he felt sick and dizzy.  His buddy helped him 
from the water.  He was given oxygen for 20 min and recovered.  
This diver was building up his depth experience.  His previous 
deepest dive had been to 21m.  1 hour later this diver was sick, 
he was placed back on oxygen and taken to hospital, from where 
he was discharged a few hours later. 
May 2003 03/129 
An instructor led two trainees on an assessment dive.  They 
entered the water from a pontoon and swam to a buoy.  At the 
buoy one of the trainees stated that she felt nervous about the 
dive.  They waited whilst she regained her breath and then 
descended the buoy line to a depth of 20m.  At the bottom they 
exchanged OK signals and prepared to swim off on a compass 
bearing.  The instructor then noticed that the trainees were 
ascending the line together at a faster than normal rate.  He 
followed them up and when he got to the surface one of the 
trainees was towing the other to the shore.  The instructor caught 
them up at the pontoon and he and others helped to lift the diver 
who had been towed from the water.  Resuscitation techniques 
were applied to this diver and she recovered at the scene.  She 
was placed on oxygen and taken by helicopter to hospital where 
she was reported to be recovering well. 
May 2003 03/130 
Two divers were exploring the shoreline at low water springs to 
seek an new entry point.  They walked down some weed 
covered steps and onto a flat area of weed covered concrete.  
One of the pair slipped on the penultimate step and struck the 
base of her spine on the edge of a step.  She conducted shore 
dives later that day and the following day.  Later the second day 
she sought medical advice.  Her only injury was found to be 
bruising and she was given painkillers and anti-inflammatory 
drugs. 
May 2003 03/304 
Diver reported as suffering from chest pains and croaky voice.  
Airlifted to recompression facility for treatment; air reported as 
suspect.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2003 03/125 
Two divers began a dive down an underwater cliff face.  At 12m 
one of the pair experienced problems with her buoyancy and 
began to sink.  Her buddy got her to the cliff face and removed 
one of her weights.  However she still sank and, in the process, 
lost a fin.  Her buddy came to the surface and raised the alarm.  
A search was initiated for the missing diver.  In the mean time 
the missing diver was discovered, swimming in circles, at 20m, 
by two other divers.  The missing diver had suffered from severe 
mask squeeze and was blind.  The two divers brought her slowly 
to the surface; she had 61 bar remaining in her cylinder.  The 
blinded diver was taken by helicopter to a recompression facility 
for treatment.  45 min later her buddy began to show signs of 
DCI and he too was airlifted for recompression treatment. The 
diver who had had buoyancy problems was diving in a hired 
drysuit and had problems with her suit earlier in the day.   Both 
divers were reported to have subsequently made good 
recoveries. 
May 2003 03/131 
A diver was helping to load a boat from a pier.  He stepped up 
from the pier over the side of a high sided pilot boat to move 
equipment to the RHIB which was moored to the outside of the 
pilot boat.  Whilst stepping off the pier he slipped and fell back 
onto the pier.  The cylinder that he was carrying felt onto his right 
wrist and he fell on top of the cylinder.  After the fall his wrist 
seemed to be unbroken and he continued with the planned dive.  
Later that day the wrist began to swell and became more painful.  
He sought medical advice and an X ray suggested a possible 
fracture of the scaphoid.  His wrist was placed in plaster for three 
weeks and the final diagnosis was that he had suffered bruising 
of cartilage and bone. 
June 2003 03/329 
Report came to Coastguard that a diver had been hit by another 
vessel, diver suffered bruising, owner not reprimanded, but 
vessel known to other craft.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2003 03/158 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 42m.  At the 
end of the dive they returned to the shotline and untied it from 
the wreck.  They began their ascent.  At about 15m one of the 
pair noticed that the other diver was below him and he 
descended to join him.  When he got to the other diver, at a 
depth of about 24m he found him to be unresponsive and 
sinking.  He tried to attract the diver's attention but got no 
response.  The diver's eyes appeared half rolled back and he 
had a blank, vague expression on his face.  He took hold of the 
unresponsive diver and began to lift him to the surface using a 
controlled buoyant lift.  At around 9m the unresponsive diver 
gave the OK signal and began to make his own ascent.  The pair 
stopped for 1 min at 3m and then surfaced.  The rescuing diver 
called for assistance from the boat which approached to assist.  
Two other divers entered the water, helped to release them from 
the shotline, in which they had become tangled and assisted 
them back onto the boat.  The diver who had been unresponsive 
was placed on oxygen and the emergency services were alerted.  
They were met by a lifeboat and provided with further oxygen.  
Once ashore the diver was taken to hospital from where he was 
released after a check up.  This diver was not aware of any 
problem during his ascent which he believed to have been 
normal except for sinking back to 24m due to buoyancy 
problems.  He does not recall the other diver trying to attract his 
attention.  This diver was taking a daily dose of amitriptyline for 
pain control of a previous head and neck injury.  Further medical 
advice was being sought.  The diver's air was checked and no 
problems were found. 
June 2003 03/413 
Lifeboat launched to help diver with illness.  (RNLI report). 
June 2003 03/160 
A diver completed a 28 min dive to a depth of 33m.  1 hour after 
surfacing he began to feel nauseous and dizzy; he then began to 
vomit.  He developed a tingling feeling in his hands, he was 
weak and unable to stand or walk.  He was given oxygen.  It was 
thought that the diver was suffering from food poisoning since 
two others in the party, who had not dived, were experiencing 
similar problems and all had eaten in the same place the night 
before.  The ambulance service was contacted and a doctor 
attended.  The doctor consulted diving medics who insisted that 
the diver be airlifted to a recompression facility.  The diver was 
examined at the recompression facility and was recompressed 
as a precaution.  His symptoms remained and the final diagnosis 
was gastric flu/viral infection.  He was kept in hospital for three 
nights.

boat he noticed that his left bicep and elbow hurt.  He spent the 
next hour helping other divers on and off of the boat.  He then 
discussed the pain with others and was placed on oxygen.  Once 
ashore he was taken to a recompression facility.  After an 
examination he was transferred to a hospital where the final 
diagnosis of a muscle strain was made.

dive 4 hours earlier, had breathed oxygen immediately after the 
dive having felt unwell.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2003 03/215 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 26m.  20 min 
into the dive, at a depth of 20m, her left ear felt a little 
uncomfortable and took two or three attempts to clear.  Upon 
surfacing the diver had a mild headache, she felt unwell and had 
earache later that evening.  She took pain killers and felt well the 
following day although she had intermittent deafness and a 
feeling of 'fullness' in her ear.  Two days later she commenced 
another dive.  At 3m she experienced vertigo.  This feeling 
persisted and at 13m she aborted the dive.  Upon surfacing she 
experienced tinnitus and deafness in her left ear.  Once on shore 
a considerable amount of wax was removed from her ear but the 
problem remained.  Ten days after the causal dive she saw a 
medical specialist and a rupture of the round window of her left 
ear was diagnosed.  This injury appeared to be healing. 
August 2003 03/241

harbour of having a diver aboard with pains in left arm.  Rescue 
helicopter Coastguard team and ambulance tasked.  
(Coastguard report). 
August 2003 03/227 
An RHIB suffered engine failure at a dive site and it was 
anchored.  Another RHIB assisted by recovering the divers from 
the disabled boat and then towing the boat back to the shore.  
The disabled boat was released before it was secured to a jetty 
and it began to be blown by the wind into shallow water.  The 
rescuing boat went to assist and the painter from the disabled 
boat was thrown to a crew member in the rescuing boat.  The 
rescuing boat was put into reverse and the painter was pulled 
from the hand of the crew member.  The painter had a karabiner 
on the end and this caught the middle finger of the crew 
member, breaking it and removing the skin from the end of this 
finger.  He was taken to hospital for treatment. 
September 2003 03/244 
Two divers conducted an 11 min dive to a depth of 6m.  Both 
experienced sinus pain over their left eyes.  Both were placed on 
oxygen for 30 min and given water.  No subsequent ill effects 
were experienced. 
September 2003 03/230 
A diver completed a 24 min dive to 33m with safety stops of 1 
min at 9m and 3 min at 6m.  2 hours 30 min later he dived to 
19m for 44 min with a 3 min safety stop at 6m.  After the first 
dive he felt seasick and spent the interim period ashore.  The 
diver was involved in pull-starting engines and charging 
cylinders.  At 11 o'clock that night he was woken by pain in his 
left shoulder and elbow and he sought medical advice.  He was 
taken by helicopter to a recompression facility where he received 
two recompression treatment sessions.  The treatment did not 
change his symptoms.  He was given pain killers.  It was 
concluded that the diver had suffered from a pulled or strained 
muscle. 
September 2003 03/246 
A 65 year old diver had just completed buoyancy control training 
in a swimming pool.  As he left the pool he experienced a short 
term memory loss, unable to remember anything that had 
happened towards the end of his training session.  He was taken 
to hospital and he was found to have elevated blood pressure 
and it was suspected that he had suffered a transient ischemic 
attack. 
September 2003 03/375 
Dive support vessel whilst involved in the evacuation of a diver 
suffering from suspected DCI, reported having an injured diver 
aboard.  Apparently having dislocated shoulder whilst assisting.

Lifeboat launched to assist dive boat with problems.  (RNLI 
report). 
April 2003 03/097 
A group of divers prepared to enter the water in a sheltered 
harbour area.  They were briefed to stay in a confined area of 
the harbour.  During the dive, one pair left the main group and 
strayed outside of the agreed area and out of sight, outside the 
harbour wall.  When the main group surfaced the missing pair 
were noted and the Coastguard was alerted.  The missing 
divers were recovered by another dive boat and safely returned. 
 
 
May 2003 03/102 
Two divers undertook a dive to a maximum depth of 15m for a 
duration of 23 min.  Their boat dropped them in the lee of a 
large rock as there was a large swell.  During the dive they 
encountered a current and were unable to swim back against it.  
They deployed a delayed SMB and made their ascent.  At the 
surface they discovered that they had moved around the rock 
and were out of sight of their boat.  They blew a whistle but 
were too far away to be heard.  They deployed a large flag, fully 
inflated their SMB and switched on a strobe light.  The dive had 
been in the evening and dusk was approaching.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and a search involving three lifeboats 
and a helicopter was instigated.  The divers were recovered by 
their own boat after being at the surface for 75 min.  The dive 
boat initially searched in the wrong area and was directed to the 
correct search area by the Coastguard based upon tide and 
current predictions.  The flag that the divers carried made them 
easy to find once the boat was in the correct area.   No 
subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
May 2003 03/291 
Coastguard received call from RNLI of two divers in difficulty in 
surf, assisted ashore by lifeboat crew, no further medical 
attention required.  (Coastguard report).

informing of suffering engine failure.  No divers were in the 
water, towed to shore by lifeboat.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
May 2003 03/296 
Dive support vessel (RHIB) called Coastguard by mobile phone, 
reporting they had lost power and were drifting with two divers 
still in the water. They could not anchor as they had lost that in 
the morning, furthermore the divers had no detection aids as 
they had lost them also in the morning.  Lifeboat recovered 
divers clinging to the Mew stone, dive RHIB towed to safety by 
lifeboat.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
May 2003 03/301

had suffered engine failure, towed to harbour by lifeboat.  
(Coastguard & RNLI report). 
May 2003 03/406 
Coastguard, police, ambulance and a lifeboat responded to a 
diver who was reported to be in difficulty.  He was rescued from 
the water and taken to hospital. 
May 2003 03/137 
Three pairs of divers entered the water from a dive boat at 10 
min intervals.  Shortly after the last pair had started their dive 
the cox and crew noticed a sea mist approaching.  They 
managed to recover the first pair of divers before the mist 
surrounded them, but lost sight of the SMBs of the other two 
pairs.  The cox alerted the Coastguard.  One pair was picked up 
by a passing boat, but the last pair were not found for over 1 
hour.  These divers blew whistles and one of them switched on 
an EPIRB that he was carrying.  Eventually they were spotted 
by a fishing boat which had been assisting in the search.  The 
fishing boat radioed the lifeboat and they were recovered.  One 
of the divers' drysuit had a leak in the dump valve mounting and 
he was very cold.  The lifeboat had not been listening for the 
EPIRB because they had not been told that the divers were 
carrying one.  The divers were subsequently informed that the 
Coastguard helicopter (which had been preparing to join the 
search) monitors for EPIRB signals as a matter of course.  
There was some doubt that the EPIRB may not have been 
working due to a sealing fault.  The marine forecast had not 
included a mist warning. 
June 2003 03/147 
Two divers commenced a dive by swimming down the anchor 
line of their boat.  The boat was positioned close to a rocky 
outcrop and they had been briefed that the current was running 
away from the rocks.  They swam over kelp until they found 
exposed rocks.  At this point, about 16 min into the dive, the 
current was running in the opposite direction to that anticipated.  
They prepared a delayed SMB.  During this process the reel of 
the SMB jammed and the reel was released to allow the SMB to 
ascend without pulling the diver to the surface.  They did not 
have a second SMB.  They continued their dive to a total 
duration of 31 min including 3 min of decompression stops.  
Their maximum depth was 18m.  Upon surfacing they realized 
that they were a long way from their boat, around the other side 
of the rocks.  The surface party had discovered the free-floating 
SMB and had begun a search for the divers.  When the divers 
were overdue the Coastguard was alerted and a search began 
involving two lifeboats, a helicopter and four other craft.  The 
divers were found by one of the other craft, safe and well, 1 
hour after surfacing. 
June 2003 03/320 
Dive support vessel reported having engine problems, thought 
to be fuel related, was able to limp home under own power 
supervised by Harbour Master.  Problem was faulty kill switch.  
(Coastguard report). 
June 2003 03/134 
A dive boat was returning from a dive when the fuel for the 
outboard engine ran out.  A second tank was connected to the 
engine but it could not be restarted.  The divers paddled the 
boat to a safe position and the Coastguard was alerted.  A 
police launch attended and towed the boat to the harbour.  It 
was later thought that the engine had run out of oil.  The engine 
was a 2 stroke engine and the oil was supplied from a separate 
tank.  When this tank ran out the engine was designed to shut 
down. 
June 2003 03/127 
An RHIB was on passage to a dive site when a red flare was 
seen fired from a nearby speedboat.  The divers went to 
investigate.  The boat had stalled in choppy seas.  As the dive 
boat approached the brand new speedboat, the speedboat 
pitched upright and sank stern first.  The speedboat crew, a 
man and two boys, were recovered into the RHIB.  They were 
wearing T shirts and shorts and had no lifejackets.  They were 
wrapped in exposure blankets and taken safely to the shore.  
The Coastguard was alerted. 
June 2003 03/315 
Dive support vessel, reported having broken down with divers 
still in the water, lifeboat tasked and as lifeboat arrived vessel 
managed to restart engine.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
June 2003 03/141 
Two divers descended a shotline to a wreck in a depth of 29m.  
The shotline was rigged with a small counterweight at the top to 
be self adjusting.  When the divers entered the sea state was 2 
to 3 as forecast.  During the dive the sea state rose to 6, the 
counterweight became tangled and the shotline was carried 
away from the wreck in the current.  The crew of the covering 
boat were unaware and followed the shot, believing they were 
over the wreck.  Towards the end of the dive the two divers 
were unable to find the shotline and deployed a delayed SMB 
and made their ascent.  At the surface they were out of sight of 
the boat.  When it was realized that they were overdue the 
Coastguard was alerted and a search was initiated.  45 min 
after surfacing the divers were spotted by a searching 
helicopter and then they were picked up by a lifeboat.  No 
subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
June 2003 03/407 
Lifeboat launched to assist dive boat with engine problems.  
(RNLI report). 
June 2003 03/408 
Lifeboat launched to assist dive boat with engine problems.  
Craft towed in.  (RNLI report). 
June 2003 03/210 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 28m.  
They encountered a slight current so they deployed their 
delayed SMB after 12 min.  After completing the dive they 
surfaced with a total dive time of 32 min.  Their boat was about 
400m away from them and they were not seen.  The boat crew 
was occupied because another member of the party had 
surfaced rapidly without his buddy.  After 20 min their boat 
began to search for them but they were unable to attract the 
attention of those on board.  They drifted into a race.  Other 
boats failed to notice them.  The boat crew alerted the 
Coastguard and a helicopter, a lifeboat and other craft 
commenced a search.  They were eventually found after 2 
hours by another dive boat which spotted their yellow and 
orange SMB.  Both were safely recovered. 
 
 
June 2003 03/324 
Dive vessel reported breaking down with ten persons on board.

June 2003 03/325 
Member of the public reported diving RHIB stuck on rocks, with 
possibility of two divers also stuck.  Recovered by fishing vessel 
and returned to shore.   Dive vessel recovered and also 
returned to shore.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2003 03/145 
Two people were waiting in their dive boat whilst four divers 
conducted a dive to a depth of 26m.  These two people noticed 
a boat of an estimated 6,000 tons coming straight for them.  
They were flying an A flag but the boat continued towards them.  
The unhooked themselves from the shotline buoy and 
attempted to alert the vessel.  It appears that there was no one 
on the bridge and the boat passed directly over the divers' 
bubbles.  The divers remained on the bottom and they were 
affected by the wash of the ship, the vibration of the propellers 
and sand being stirred up around them, but were otherwise 
unharmed.  A crew member from the boat gave a 'friendly 
wave'. 
June 2003 03/410 
Lifeboat launched to assist dive boat with fouled propeller.  
Craft towed in.  (RNLI report).

June 2003 03/328 
Dive vessel reported bad seamanship following an incident 
where a vessel steamed through a dive site being used by 
many divers, all displaying the alpha flag.  Offending vessel 
interviewed by Coastguard, a report of a Hazrep was filed.  
(Coastguard report). 
June 2003 03/327 
Harbour Master reported that a pleasure vessel had picked up 
two divers, who had become separated from their dive boat.   
Dive boat had lost communications.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2003 03/211 
Three divers entered the water from an RHIB and began their 
dive.  The cox noticed that the fuel was running low and 
switched over to the second tank.  The engine stopped and 
would not restart.  The cox found that a fuel line had become 
disconnected and he reconnected it.  The engine was prone to 
oiling up and could not be restarted.  The cox was unable to 
find a plug spanner onboard.  The divers resurfaced and were 
drifting away from the boat.  One of the boat crew monitored 
their position.  The cox called the Coastguard but was unable to 
hear a response.  He then radioed nearby boats for assistance 
and a yacht relayed his message.  A helicopter was dispatched 
to assist and was directed towards the divers, whose SMB 
could still be seen.  Another diver boat recovered the divers and 
the RHIB crew managed to restart the engine.  They returned to 
shore where they were met by Coastguards.  They were 
informed that a lifeboat was searching for them.  The RHIB 
crew had not heard the radio message from the Coastguard 
telling them this as they had been experiencing problems with 
VHF radio reception. 
June 2003 03/412 
Two lifeboats launched to assist dive boat that was out of fuel.  
Craft brought in.  (RNLI report).

Dive support vessel reported having a missing diver, rescue 
helicopter was scrambled, the diver was spotted by parent 
vessel, SAR units stood down, subsequent investigation 
revealed the delayed SMB had become entangled.  
(Coastguard report). 
July 2003 03/335 
Dive support vessel, reported as overdue.  Communication 
search commenced vessel found safe and well.  (Coastguard 
report). 
July 2003 03/171 
Two RHIBs were returning separately to the shore after a day's 
diving.  The engine of one of the boats spluttered and then 
stopped.  The cox found that the bulb in the fuel line was flat 
and she was unable to pump fuel.  The fuel tank showed less 
than a quarter but not zero.  She anchored the boat and alerted 
the Coastguard.  The Coastguard attempted to contact the 
second boat to assist.  After 10 min she found that she could 
pump fuel again and she was able to start the engine.  She 
informed the Coastguard and continued her journey.  She was 
met by the second boat which accompanied her back to the 
shore. 
July 2003 03/247 
An instructor and a trainee were involved in a shore dive in a 
lake.  Boats were not usually allowed on the lake.  However on 
this day there was a problem with walkers on the shore of the 
lake and a rescue boat was launched to help.  The rescue boat 
drove straight over the two divers who were 50m offshore in a 
depth of 4m.  They suffered no ill effects. 
July 2003 03/174 
A group of divers deployed a shotline on a wreck.  The first pair 
entered the water and on arrival at 33m discovered that the shot 
had been dragged off the wreck.  They sent the shot to the 
surface with a lifting bag and swam on an agreed bearing to try 
to find the wreck.  They encountered a 0.5 knot current and 
decided to drift with the current.  They then deployed their 
SMBs but became separated whilst doing so.  Divers in the boat

recovered the shot and re-laid it on the wreck and a second pair 
entered the water.  When the second pair surfaced they 
reported that the first pair had not been seen and a search was 
initiated.  The first pair had surfaced and met up at the surface.  
Divers in the boat alerted the Coastguard of the missing pair 
and a surface search involving a lifeboat, a helicopter and an 
aircraft was initiated.  The divers activated an emergency 
beacon, deployed sea dye and used a torch to attract attention.  
The divers were spotted by the aircraft and recovered by their 
dive boat 4 miles from their entry point after 2 hours 45 min in 
the water.  They suffered no ill effects. 
August 2003 03/350 
Whilst on exercise RNLI lifeboat assisted divers from rocks 
where they had been trapped by tide and current.  Taken to 
own dive support vessel.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2003 03/349 
Dive support vessel reported having two divers missing in fog, 
Coastguard rescue helicopter scrambled to assist in locating 
missing divers.  The divers were subsequently found by the 
diving vessel as the helicopter arrived on scene.  Neither diver 
required medical assistance.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2003 03/423 
A dive boat reported two diving pairs missing to the Coastguard.  
The dive boat later recovered all divers safely. 
August 2003 03/422 
A sudden, freak, storm caused a dive RHIB with six people 
onboard to run aground.  They issued a 'Mayday' call but 
managed to free themselves before the lifeboat arrived to 
assist. 
August 2003 03/355 
Two divers waved for assistance following a shore dive having 
become fatigued, were assisted by a dive vessel and met by 
Coastguard Team once ashore, no medical treatment required.  
(Coastguard report). 
August 2003 03/359 
Dive support vessel raised the alarm having two missing divers, 
rescue helicopter scrambled and RNLI all weather boat 
requested to launch, divers recovered by own vessel, heavy 
swell prevented the boat from seeing them despite having 
surface detection aids.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2003 03/358 
Dive support vessel reported having two missing divers, 
Coastguard rescue helicopter scrambled, as another vessel 
reported having located the missing divers and recovered them 
aboard, helicopter stood down.  (Coastguard report). 
 
 
 
 
August 2003 03/201 
Two pairs of divers undertook a drift dive in a depth of 14m, 
leaving two others in the boat.  When the first pair surfaced they 
took control of the boat and the third pair got ready to dive.  The 
boat was driven up current and against the wind to a suitable 
entry point for this third pair.  The divers entered the water and 
the boat moved down current to collect the second pair who 
were expected back at the surface.  The boat crew spent 20 
min trying to locate the second pair but failed to do so.  The 
divers were at the surface and could see the boat.  The search 
was extended back towards where the third pair had entered in 
hope of recovering them to help with the search.  The sun was 
low in the sky and the sea surface was choppy.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and a lifeboat and a helicopter were 
tasked to search.  The lifeboat arrived first and coordinated a 
search involving the dive boat and a large speedboat that came 
to assist.  The speedboat was high out of the water and the 
divers were soon spotted.  One pair was recovered by the 
lifeboat and the other by the dive boat.  All safely returned to 
shore.  Each pair was using an SMB but other surface detection 
aids were not carried. 
August 2003 03/366 
HM Coastguard requested the launch of RNLI lifeboat to assist 
two divers in difficulty, Coastguard rescue team attending, both 
divers returned to shore by lifeboat.  (Coastguard report).

Ascents 
 
 
October 2002 03/031 
A pair of divers made a dive to a maximum depth of 22m.  
Towards the end of the dive they made a gradual ascent to 
12m; they spent 5 min at this depth.  They then became 
separated and both made rapid ascents to the surface.  Their 
total dive duration was 41 min.  They were recovered into the 
boat.  Both their computers indicated alarms and they were 
placed on oxygen.  During the return journey to the shore one of 
the divers reported a numbness in the little finger of both his 
hands.  Once ashore he was taken to hospital.  No further 
treatment was found necessary. 
October 2002 03/021 
A pair of divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 36m.  
At 13m one of the pair lost control of his buoyancy and made a 
rapid ascent to the surface.  He was placed on oxygen.  Their 
total dive duration was 10 min.  No subsequent ill effects were 
experienced. 
October 2002 03/022 
A pair of divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 36m.  
At 25m one of the pair was unable to make his drysuit dump 
valve function and he made a rapid ascent to the surface.  Their 
total dive duration was 16 min.  No subsequent ill effects were 
experienced. 
January 2003 03/053 
A pair of divers were ascending from a 28 min dive to a 
maximum depth of 31m.  During the ascent, one of the divers 
got air in her drysuit boots and became inverted.  Her buddy 
tried to hold on to her but she made a rapid ascent to the 
surface.  She experienced a slight headache.  She was placed 
on oxygen for 20 min and kept under observation for a further 1 
hour.  She did not experience further symptoms. 
January 2003 03/054 
Two divers conducted a dive to 21m for 24 min.  Later that day 
they dived again, to 28m.  During this dive one of the pair 
experienced a regulator free flow and he made a rapid ascent 
to the surface.  At the surface he called for assistance and he 
was recovered from the water.  He was distressed and he was 
placed on oxygen.  He soon recovered and showed no signs of 
injury.  He was kept under observation for 1 hour but no 
symptoms developed. 
February 2003 03/056 
Two divers were ascending from a dive to a maximum depth of 
34m.  10 min into the dive, at a depth of 20m, the regulator of 
one of the divers began to free flow.  He made a rapid ascent to 
the surface.  He was placed on oxygen as a precaution.  No 
subsequent symptoms were reported.  The water temperature 
was 6 deg C. 
February 2003 03/055 
Two divers were 11 min into a dive to a maximum depth of 22m.  
One of the divers' regulators began to free flow and he made an 
uncontrolled ascent to the surface.  He was given oxygen as a 
precaution.  No apparent injury was suffered.  The water 
temperature was 6 deg C. 
 
February 2003 03/057 
Two divers had made a 30 min dive to a maximum depth of 
20m.  They were conducting a 3 min safety stop at 6m when the 
regulator of one of the divers began to free flow.  They made a 
faster than normal ascent to the surface.  No subsequent 
problems were encountered. 
March 2003 03/068 
Two divers undertook a dive to a planned depth of 7m.  One of 
the pair was using a new drysuit.  During the dive they agreed 
to descend to 21m.  After a period at 21m the diver with the new 
drysuit experienced buoyancy problems.  Air migrated into his 
legs and he became inverted.  His buddy attempted to right him.  
They struggled for a while and the inverted diver lost his 
mouthpiece.  He grabbed the alternative air source of the other 
diver.  They began to ascend.  The buddy was unable to dump 
air from her drysuit as her arms were pinned down by the other 
diver.  They made a very rapid ascent to the surface in about 30 
sec.  At the surface they called for assistance and were 
recovered into a boat.  The diver who had been inverted had 
swallowed a lot of water and he was placed on oxygen for 30 
min.  He then developed a headache and was placed back on 
oxygen.  Both divers were taken to hospital from where they 
were released 24 hours later.  No DCI was indicated. 
March 2003 03/060 
During a training dive a diver experienced a problem with his 
weight at a depth of 17m.  The weightbelt came off and the 
diver made a rapid ascent to the surface.  The dive duration 
was 3 min.  He was kept under observation but no symptoms 
developed. 
March 2003 03/074 
Two divers were 8 min into a dive at a depth of 20m.  The 
regulator of one of the divers began to free flow.  He made a 
rapid ascent to the surface and was able to breathe from the 
regulator for part of this ascent.  Although shaken by the 
experience he showed no signs of DCI.  He was placed on 
oxygen as a precaution.  The water temperature was 5 deg C. 
March 2003 03/077 
A pair of divers were 23 min into a dive at a maximum depth of 
20m.  At this point the weightbelt of one of the divers slipped off 
and he made a fast ascent to the surface.  He suffered no ill 
effects. 
March 2003 03/078 
A diver made a 22 min dive to a depth of 5m.  1 hour 50 min 
later he dived again, this time to 21m.  After 21 min his 
regulator began to free flow and he made a faster than normal 
ascent to the surface.  He suffered no subsequent ill effects.  
The water temperature was 5 deg C. 
March 2003 03/079 
Two divers were 25 min into a dive to a maximum depth of 11m.  
At 10m one of the pair, a trainee, breathed in water through his 
regulator.  He panicked, took his buddy's regulator and then 
made a rapid ascent to the surface.  No subsequent ill effect 
was reported.

March 2003 03/206 
Two divers made a fresh water dive to a depth of 22m.  During 
the descent, at a depth of 18m, one of the divers noticed that 
her regulator was not supplying air normally and that she was 
surrounded by bubbles.  She met up with her buddy at 22m and 
gave the 'out of air' signal.  She took the alternative air source 
of the other diver and they took hold of each other before 
making their ascent.  They were surrounded by bubbles and 
unable to observe their computers.  They surfaced without 
conducting a planned safety stop and their computers indicated 
an ascent rate warning.  Their dive time was 3 min. They left the 
water and were placed on oxygen for 30 min.  One of the pair 
noticed a tingling in the fingers of one hand several hours later, 
but this subsequently resolved.  It was determined that the 
regulator had frozen causing a free flow.  The surface water 
temperature was 9 deg C. 
March 2003 03/095 
Two divers conducted a dive in a quarry to a depth of 20m.  14 
min into the dive they found the visibility to be very low and the 
cuff dump of one of the divers' drysuits was leaking.  They 
decided to terminate the dive and they started an ascent.  The 
diver with the leaking drysuit dumped too much air and began to 
re-descend.  He put more air into his suit.  Back at 17m the 
ascent began to speed up and the diver found that he was 
unable to dump enough air to prevent a rapid ascent to the 
surface.  Once out of the water, both divers were placed on 
oxygen and neither suffered subsequent ill effects. 
March 2003 03/081 
Two divers made a 25 min dive to a depth of 20m.  Some time 
later that day they dived again this time to a maximum depth of 
21m.  At 20m one of the pair became disorientated and made a 
fast ascent.  No subsequent ill effects were experienced.  The 
dive duration was 16 min. 
April 2003 03/087 
Two divers conducted a dive to 36m.  At 35m one of the pair 
became inverted and started to rise to the surface.  During the 
ascent he managed to right himself but he made an 
uncontrolled ascent to the surface, missing 10 min 
decompression at 6m.  His dive duration was 30 min.  At the 
surface his 12l cylinder was empty and he reported that he was 
just about to switch to his pony cylinder.  He was placed on 
oxygen for 15 min then, after a break, for a further 30 min.  No 
subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
April 2003 03/278 
Following a 'Pan Pan' alert it transpired that two divers made a 
rapid ascent from 16m, due to stuck inflator valve on drysuit 
freezing open?  Alternate air source ascent, given oxygen.  
Ambulance taking the two divers to hospital for treatment.  No 
symptoms developed.  (Coastguard report). 
April 2003 03/251 
Two divers completed a dive to a depth of 32m.  With 3 min of 
decompression indicated on their computers they looked for the 
shotline to ascend.  They could not find the shotline and started 
their ascent with 7 min of decompression indicated.  They 
planned to deploy a delayed SMB at 9m.  However they were 
not able to inflate the SMB.  One of the divers then ran out of air 
in his main cylinder and switched to his pony supply.  With 3 
min of decompression remaining they again attempted to inflate 
the SMB.  Whilst doing so they experienced problems with 
depth control, sinking below 9m and rising to the surface.  At 
the surface one of the divers dumped air to return to 3m but his 
loss of buoyancy caused him to drop down to 17m.  He was 
unable to inflate his suit or BCD as his main cylinder was empty 
so he dropped his weightbelt.  He surfaced having missed 3 
min of decompression stops.  He reported that wearing mittens 
and holding a camera contributed to his problems inflating the 
delayed SMB.  No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
April 2003 03/282 
Diver made a rapid ascent from 8m following a dive to 25m.  
Taken to hospital via ambulance suffering from shock, no other 
symptoms.  (Coastguard report). 
April 2003 03/106 
A trainee and an instructor conducted a dive to a maximum 
depth of 19m.  At 18m the trainee pressed both inflate and 
deflate buttons on his BCD control and lost buoyancy control.  
He made a rapid ascent to the surface.  His total dive time was 
31 min.  He was recovered from the water and placed on 
oxygen.  No subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
April 2003 03/283 
Following a normal ascent on a line, diver swept off the line.  
Ran out of air and made a rapid ascent to the surface, unable to 
maintain surface buoyancy, ditched own twin-set.  Report came 
to HM Coastguard as diver had jettisoned set on the wreck site.  
(Coastguard report). 
April 2003 03/111 
A diver dived to 33m for 37 min including a 2 min stop at 6m.  6 
hours 31 min later he dived again to 24m for 42 min.  17 hours 
13 min later he made a third dive to 33m.  After 24 min his 
computer indicated the need for a stop at 6m and he began his 
ascent.  He found that the cuff dump of his drysuit would not 
release air.  He then lost control of his ascent and began to rise 
quickly.  He was eventually able to release air from his neck 
seal but could not prevent himself being carried directly to the 
surface.  He ascended from 28m in under 2 min.  His total dive 
duration was 28 min.  Once out of the water he was placed on 
oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted of a potential problem.  
No symptoms were experienced and no further actions were 
taken.  The diver believes that the cuff dump had been blocked 
by a long sleeved thermal vest that he was wearing, the valve 
worked correctly when checked later. 
April 2003 03/112 
A diver completed a 30 min dive to a maximum depth of 32m.  
During the dive she spent 2 min at 20m and then made a faster 
than normal ascent to the surface.  This was her first use of a 
drysuit for some time and she felt that the suit was tight.  2 
hours 10 min after the dive she complained of 'pins and 
needles' in her left hand and her left arm felt 'dead'.  She was 
placed on oxygen and given water to drink.  40 min later she 
was taken off oxygen with no ill effect.  It was concluded that 
the problem was muscular.  She took more fluids and did not 
dive again that day. 
May 2003 03/105 
Two divers conducted a dive in a quarry at a depth of 35m.  
Underwater visibility was poor and they used reels to lay 
distance lines.  When they returned to the starting point one of 
the pair became tangled in the lines.  They stirred up sediment, 
the visibility became zero and both divers became tangled in 
the lines.  The delay caused the divers to exceed the no stop 
time and they began to ascend an underwater rock face, still 
tangled.  At 32m one of the pair emptied one of his twin 
cylinders and switched back to the second cylinder which 
contained 50 bar.  At 26m the other diver started to drop back 
down.  The diver who was low on air then used the last of her 
air to inflate her BCD and, at 23m,  switched to her 
decompression cylinder which contained nitrox 80.  At this point 

NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2003                          
©BSAC -2003   29 
she dropped the reel and got free of the tangle.  She ascended 
rapidly to 6m and completed 3 min of an indicated 15 min 
decompression.  She then surfaced and was placed on oxygen.  
The diver who had sunk back down used his BCD to regain 
buoyancy and also became free of the tangle.  He made a rapid 
ascent directly to the surface, missing an indicated 28 min of 
decompression stops.  He swam to a jetty, left the water, and 
was placed on oxygen.  The dive duration was 41 min.   Both 
divers were taken to hospital and kept on oxygen for 4 hours.  
No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
May 2003 03/192 
A diver completed a 31 min dive to 31m with a 1 min stop at 9m 
and a 3 min stop at 6m.  2 hours 13 min later she undertook a 
47 min dive to 25m including a 2 min stop at 9m and a 5 min 
stop at 6m.  At the end of this second dive she lost control of 
her buoyancy and surfaced missing 1 min of decompression.  
No subsequent ill effects were experienced.  Sea swell 
exacerbated the buoyancy problems. 
May 2003 03/136 
Two divers completed a dive to a maximum depth of 20m for a 
duration of 43 min of which the last 23 min was spent at 6m.  
After a surface interval of 1 hour 53 min the pair dived again.  5 
min into the second dive, at a depth of 18m, one of the pair 
pressed the inflation valve of his drysuit to adjust his buoyancy.  
The valve stuck and the diver became positively buoyant.  He 
disconnected the direct feed hose but rose from 16m to 3m in 
20 sec.  This diver had become separated from his buddy and 
surfaced.  The second diver surfaced 3 min later.  The hose 
was reconnected and found to work correctly.  The divers then 
conducted a 20 min dive to a maximum depth of 20m.  After the 
dive the computer of the diver who had made the rapid ascent 
indicated a warning, analysis of the computer dive log showed a 
'high blood bubble level' from the point of the rapid ascent to the 
end of the last dive. No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
May 2003 03/311 
Dive support vessel reported having a diver onboard feeling 
unwell following a dive where she omitted decompression 
stops.  Vessel met by ambulance and doctor consulted, no 
treatment given.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2003 03/321 
Dive support vessel contacted Coastguard reporting having a 
diver aboard who had missed stops, additional oxygen was 
requested, another dive vessel assisted with oxygen.  Diver and 
buddy examined by paramedic and released with safety advice 
and emergency phone number.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2003 03/138 
Two divers conducted a dive to a depth of 17m.  One of the 
divers had not dived recently and was unfamiliar with her 
drysuit.  Her buddy noticed that her weightbelt was slipping and 
attempted to assist.  The weightbelt fell free and the buoyant 
diver began to ascend.  The buddy took hold of her and used 
his own weight to slow the ascent.  At 6m he let go of the 
buoyant diver who rose to the surface.  The buddy completed a 
normal ascent.  Their dive time was approximately 40 min.  No 
subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
June 2003 03/322 
Dive support vessel reported two divers having made a rapid 
ascent from 31m, were administered oxygen, medical advice 
was obtained.  Conveyed to hospital by ambulance.   
June 2003 03/323 
Dive support vessel reported having a diver aboard who had 
made a rapid ascent from 30m.  The dive vessel put the patient 
back into the water to finish any outstanding decompression!!!  
(Coastguard report). 
July 2003 03/334 
Dive support vessel reported having a diver aboard who had 
missed 22 min of stops, showing no ill effects, being 
administered oxygen.  After seeking medical advice, the patient 
was airlifted to recompression facility for treatment.  
(Coastguard report). 
July 2003 03/336 
Dive charter vessel contacted Coastguard to inform they had a 
diver aboard who had made a rapid ascent from 30m. The diver 
was airlifted to recompression chamber for treatment.  
(Coastguard report). 
July 2003 03/339 
Dive support vessel reported having a diver aboard having 
made a rapid ascent, was administered oxygen and developed 
no signs of DCI or lung expansion injury.  (False alarm with 
good intent).  (Coastguard report). 
July 2003 03/340 
Two divers airlifted to recompression chamber, following a rapid 
ascent from 32m.  Medi link used, one diver also received a 
blow to the mouth causing bleeding.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2003 03/180 
A diver was diving in a borrowed drysuit and had added extra 
weights to his weightbelt as a consequence.  At the end of the 
dive to 25m he was ascending when, at 8m, he felt his 
weightbelt slip.  He was unable to stop it falling away completely 
and, as a result, he made a buoyant ascent to the surface.  His 
computer had been showing no stops prior to the event but on 
surfacing indicated that a 1 min stop at 3m had been missed.  
The diver suffered no ill effects. 
July 2003 03/346 
Dive support vessel reported having two divers aboard who had 
missed stops following a 33m dive being their second of the 
day, following medical advice, both divers evacuated by rescue 
helicopter and transferred to recompression chamber for 
treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2003 03/236 
Two divers conducted a dive to 25m.  One of the pair deployed 
a delayed SMB but the line became tangled on the reel and it 
was abandoned.  The other diver deployed her delayed SMB 
and they ascended.  One of the divers was too buoyant and 
was unable to stop at 3m to conduct the 5 min stop indicated by 
her computer.  She rose directly to the surface and her buddy 
went with her.  They were recovered into separate boats and 
placed on oxygen.  The Coastguard was notified and the divers 
were taken to the shore.  Once ashore they sought medical 
advice and went to hospital.  They were placed on oxygen for 6 
hours.  Neither diver suffered ill effects. 
August 2003 03/216 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 41m.  
They began their ascent up the shotline.  A current had begun 
to flow and at 20m they found two other divers holding the shot 
buoy which had been pulled down by the effect of the current 
and the divers' drag on the shotline.  One pair of divers let go of 
the shotline and began to deploy a delayed SMB.  Whilst doing 

  NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2003 
30  ©BS-AC - 2003 
so they lost control of their buoyancy and made an uncontrolled 
ascent to the surface missing 8 min of decompression stops.  
Their dive time was 22 min.  They were recovered into their 
boat and placed on oxygen.  The Coastguard was alerted and 
the boat returned to the shore.  The divers were taken by 
ambulance to a recompression facility.  They were kept on 
oxygen for a further 3 hours but were not recompressed.  They 
suffered no subsequent ill effects. 
August 2003 03/199 
Two divers completed a wreck dive to a depth of 33m.  At the 
end of the dive they were unable to find the shotline and so they 
deployed a delayed SMB and made their ascent.  At 8m the 
SMB line became snagged and the diver holding it felt that she 
was being pulled through the water.  She was unable to free the 
line by pulling on it so she abandoned the reel.  During this 
period the other diver was caught by another SMB line and 
pulled to the surface.  This diver re-descended to join his 
buddy.  His computer was showing an error state and indicated 
a requirement for 18 min of decompression.  By this time the 
first diver had 7 min of decompression remaining and they 
completed this together before surfacing.  Their total dive time 
was 48 min.  The diver who had missed stops was given lots of 
water to drink and no subsequent ill effects were experienced.  
It was later discovered that other divers had seen the first SMB 
and tried to pull it in, not realizing that there was a diver below. 
August 2003 03/217 
Two divers dived to 21m.  They became lost and ascended up a 
rock face to 5m.  They stopped at 5m for 1 min but one of the 
pair began to breathe in water and they made a fast ascent to 
the surface.  No subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
August 2003 03/351 
Dive support vessel reported having two divers aboard having 
made a rapid ascent.  Treated at DDRC Plymouth.  
(Coastguard report). 
August 2003 03/352 
Recompression chamber reported giving medical advice to dive 
support vessel with two divers aboard having made a rapid 
ascent.  Air assets were on another tasking, the vessel made its 
way to port, when the air asset became available the helicopter 
transferred both patients to recompression chamber for 
treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2003 03/356 
A call was intercepted by Coastguard, between dive support 
vessel and port control, stating requiring immediate access to 
the port to evacuate two divers who had missed stops one 
having also run out of air.  The vessel had accessed medical 
advice direct.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2003 03/243 
A diver conducted a dive to 35m.  During the ascent, at a depth 
of 13m, he lost control of his buoyancy and rose faster than 
normal to the surface.  His dive time was 36 min.  He was 
placed on oxygen as a precaution but no symptoms developed. 
August 2003 03/221 
Two divers dived to 33m for 16 min.  At the end of the dive they 
made a fast ascent, missing a planned safety stop.  Both were 
placed on oxygen.  No subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
August 2003 03/357 
Dive support vessel reported having a diver aboard having 
missed all stops following a 35m dive, duration unknown, 
missed 18 min of stops.  Airlifted by rescue helicopter R-WB 
taken to hyperbaric chamber for treatment.  The patient had 
been diving in a three and the vessel had divers aboard from 
various clubs etc.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2003 03/222 
A diver was diving at a depth of 43m.  He became entangled in 
a net and removed his stab jacket to cut himself free.  There 
was a strong current and he was unable to release his 
equipment so he made a free ascent to the surface.  His 
computer indicated an emergency.  The Coastguard was 
alerted and the diver was airlifted to a recompression facility.  
No DCI was diagnosed but the diver was given a precautionary 
recompression treatment because of his fast ascent. 
August 2003 03/368 
Dive support vessel reported to recompression chamber having 
a diver aboard having made a rapid ascent from 30m. The 
recompression chamber contacted Coastguard who scrambled 
the Coastguard helicopter and Pool Coastguard team to assist.  
Transferred to hyperbaric chamber for treatment.  It transpired 
that the delayed SMB had become tangled upon deployment, 
causing them to ascend rapidly.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2003 03/229 
Two divers conducted a night wreck dive to a depth of 29m.  
Towards the end of their dive they noticed a current start to pick 
up.  They deployed a delayed SMB and when they released it 
the line paid out horizontally to the limit of the 50m line.  They 
began their ascent and found themselves apparently being 
pulled quickly through the water by the line.  It was later 
deduced that the line had caught around the shotline preventing 
the divers from drifting in the strong current.  They held onto 
each other and ascended with the line horizontal until they 
reached 10m where they made a 3 min stop.  The line started to 
jerk them upwards so one of the pair decided to cut the line.  
Whilst doing so the two divers were carried to the surface.  
Their dive time was 49 min.  They signaled to the boat and 
were recovered.  One of the divers' computer indicated that 
they had missed an 11 min stop at 3m.  They were placed on 
oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  The boat returned to 
the shore and the divers were taken to a recompression facility 
where they were given a precautionary recompression 
treatment. 
September 2003 03/232 
Two divers undertook a drift dive to a planned maximum depth 
of 25m.  The current carried them to 27m.  The weightbelt of 
one of the divers came loose and whilst trying to tighten it it fell 
away.  His buddy took hold of him and both dumped air but they 
were not able to prevent a buoyant ascent to the surface.  Their 
dive time was 12 min.  One of the pair gave the emergency 
signal to the boat which was about 20m away.  The boat crew 
then found that the engine would not start.  An auxiliary engine 
was started but this had been secured in such a way that it 
could not be lowered into the water.  Another crew member 
donned fins and entered the water to assist the divers.  He 
reached them and began to tow them to the boat. The engine 
was then started and the divers were recovered.  They were 
placed on oxygen and a mobile phone was used to alert the 
emergency services.  The boat headed to a nearby harbour and 
they were met by ambulances.  One diver complained of a pain 
in his arm.  Both were taken to hospital but no DCI was found 
and they were released after 2 hours. 
September 2003 03/231 
Two divers completed a dive to 23m for 47 min.  After an 
interval of 1 hour 42 min they dived to 26m for 51 min.  They

planned to conduct a no stop dive but as they started the ascent 
from their second dive one of their computers indicated that a 3 
min stop was required.  During the ascent one of the divers 
suffered a reversed ear and descended to clear it.  In doing so, 
whilst also having to control the SMB reel, he knocked his mask 
and had to clear it.  During this period he sank back from 5 to 
15m.  His buddy stayed with him.  They then made a rapid 
ascent to the surface.  Once back in the boat both divers' 
computers were indicating missed decompression stops.  They 
were placed on oxygen, the Coastguard was alerted and the 
boat returned to shore.  They were airlifted to a recompression 
facility where they received precautionary recompression 
treatment. 
 
 
 
September 2003 03/233 
Three divers undertook a wreck dive to a depth of 22m.  At the 
end of the dive they deployed a delayed SMB to make their 
ascent.  At 15m one of the group lost control of his buoyancy 
and made an uncontrolled ascent to the surface.  His dive time 
was 41 min.  The other two surfaced normally.  Once in the boat 
it was found that the buoyant diver's computer indicated that 3 
min of decompression stops had been missed.  He was placed 
on oxygen and transported to the shore.  Medical advice was 
sought and the diver was monitored for 48 hours.  He 
developed no ill effects.  The diver normally used a pony 
cylinder but on this dive he had not and he was underweighted 
at the end of the dive. 
September 2003 03/380 
'Mayday' call from dive support vessel requesting assistance for 
two divers who had missed 20 min of stops, airlifted to hospital 
by rescue helicopter R-128.  (Coastguard report).

October 2002 03/008 
A diver using trimix 17/32 dived with a group of others to a depth 
of 60m.  On the way down the shotline he realized that he had 
forgotten his weightbelt.  On the bottom he searched for objects 
to put in his BCD pockets.  Affected by narcosis he became 
separated from the rest of the group.  After the planned time he 
deployed a delayed SMB and began his ascent.  During the 
ascent he switched to nitrox 36.  He was swept onto the shotline 
and took hold of this.  The sea state (wind around force 6) and 
the current made it difficult for him to hold on to the line to 
complete his stops.  He decided to make a slow ascent up the 
line and to get on to oxygen in the boat.  At the surface he used 
nitrox 50.  He was recovered into the boat and placed on oxygen.  
He had missed 30 min of decompression stops.  The Coastguard 
was alerted and the diver and his buddy were airlifted to a 
recompression facility.  The diver received precautionary 
treatment.  He suffered no lasting effects. 
November 2002 03/024 
Three rebreather divers were conducting a dive to 36m in a 
quarry, one became separated and the other two surfaced.  10 
min later the third diver was still missing and a search was 
initiated.  Two pairs of divers descended and began to search.  
15 min after this the alarm was raised and an ambulance was 
called.  5 min later a delayed SMB came to the surface; this buoy 
carried the name of the missing diver.  The ambulance was 
cancelled.  5 min later the searching divers arrived back at the 
surface.  32 min after the alarm was first raised the missing diver 
arrived back at the surface, safe and well. 
December 2002 03/052 
A pair of divers conducted a dive to 22m for 17 min.  One of the 
pair used more air than usual and ran out at 10m.  She used her 
buddy's alternative air source and they made a rapid ascent to 
the surface.  No ill effects were reported. 
March 2003 03/071 
Two divers completed a 37 min dive to 34m.  2 hours later they 
dived again.  They planned to go to 20m.  After about 15 min 
they became separated.  One of the divers was seen by his 
buddy to be dropping down.  The other diver came to the surface 
and raised the alarm.  A single set of bubbles was seen.  10 min 
after the alarm was raised the second diver surfaced.  He had 
sunk down to 34m and found that he needed to conduct 
decompression stops on his ascent.  He was exhausted but 
otherwise unharmed. 
March 2003 03/072 
A diver was diving with a new drysuit.  She dived with a buddy to 
6m for 25 min to familiarize herself with the suit.  2 hours 30 min 
later they dived again, this time to 22m.  9 min into this dive, at a 
depth of 17m, she became uncomfortable and her buddy thought 
that she was going to bolt for the surface.  The buddy took 
control and brought her to 12m.  She then started to descend 
again and her buddy used the diver's BCD to start them 
ascending again.  At 6m the troubled diver made a rapid ascent 
to the surface.  At the surface she was extremely distressed and 
briefly unconscious.  She was recovered to the shore and placed 
on oxygen.  She was taken to hospital from where she was 
discharged shortly afterwards.  The diver was reported to have 
made an aircraft journey sometime the day before. 
 
March 2003 03/075 
A trainee diver made a dive to 15m for 35 min.  2 hours 30 min 
later he dived again, this time to 18m.  20 min into the dive he 
signaled that he had a problem with his regulator.  The instructor 
realized that a free flow was happening.  The diver went for his 
own alternative air source but the instructor gave his alternative 
air source and started to bring them to the surface.  The trainee 
spat out the regulator and they came to the surface at a normal 
rate.  At the surface the trainee was shocked but otherwise 
unharmed.  He was recovered from the water and placed on 
oxygen.  The diver was taken by ambulance to hospital.  The 
water temperature was 5 deg C. 
March 2003 03/094 
Two divers and two instructors entered the water to conduct 
controlled buoyant lift training drills from a depth of 22m.  One of 
the instructors was wearing a full face mask.  This was the first 
time that he had used it in open water.  He carried a 
conventional spare regulator and face mask as backup.  The two 
divers started their first lift.  At this point the assisting instructor 
noted that the instructor with the full face mask was 'in a state of 
confusion', and then he pulled his mask off.  He placed his 
alternative regulator in his mouth but then took it out again.  The 
assisting instructor offered his own alternative air source, placing 
it in his mouth, then offered a spare mask that he was carrying 
but the confused diver made no attempt to fit it.  The assisting 
instructor then fitted the mask for him.  After a while control was 
regained and the assisting instructor lifted the first instructor to 
the surface with a controlled buoyant lift; making a safety stop at 
3m.  The divers conducting the training drill surfaced safely a few 
minutes later.  All divers got safely from the water.  The diver 
with the face mask stated that he had had difficulty breathing 
from it hence its rapid removal.  No subsequent ill effects were 
experienced. 
April 2003 03/276 
Report received of unattended dive boat.  Subsequent 
investigations revealed diver was below;  surfaced, no further 
assistance required.  (Coastguard report). 
April 2003 03/085 
Two newly qualified divers were diving together; one adult and 
one 12 years old.  The 12 year-old was using a new drysuit.  
Early in the dive the drysuit direct feed hose of diver with the new 
drysuit became disconnected.  They reconnected this hose.  
Then, at 20m, this diver's mask flooded.  They started to ascend 
but the direct feed hose became disconnected again and was 
reconnected. They experienced buoyancy control problems and 
at the 10m the troubled diver lost his mask completely.  The 
divers managed to reach the surface where they were assisted 
from the water.  No subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
May 2003 03/308 
Dive support vessel, reported having two divers surfacing having 
run out of air, although very cold no other symptoms were 
observed, recovered to ambulance, examined but not 
hospitalized.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2003 03/213 
Two divers completed a dive to 25m.  One of the pair deployed a 
delayed SMB prior to ascending.  Before inflating the SMB she 
had 60 bar remaining.  The ascent was delayed because the 
SMB reel jammed and needed to be freed.  On completion of her 
stops, at a depth of 6m, she ran out of air.  She was passed her 
buddy's alternative air source and they made a safe ascent to

the surface. 
June 2003 03/193 
Two divers descended a shotline to a wreck.  The line was slack 
and during the descent one of the divers became tangled.  His 
buddy had continued to the wreck.  The tangled diver managed 
to free himself and continued his descent.  At the wreck he met 
up with his buddy but again became tangled in the line.  His 
buddy helped to untangle him but to do so it was necessary to 
remove his regulator on three occasions.  The regulator began to 
free flow but they were able to stop it.  They aborted the dive, 
making a short stop at 6m before surfacing.  No subsequent ill 
effects were reported. 
June 2003 03/194 
Two divers were nearing the end of a dive to 31m  but were 
unable to relocate the shotline to ascend.  One of the divers had 
only 70 bar so they deployed a delayed SMB.  This took them a 
further 2 min.  As they started their ascent the diver who was low 
on air had 30 bar remaining, the other had 110 bar.  They had 
planned to conduct a 3 min safety stop.  As they started this stop 
the air supply of the diver who was low on air ran out.  He shared 
air with his buddy and they completed the stop before surfacing.  
They were safely recovered into their boat. 
July 2003 03/161 
A dive leader entered the water with two trainees to dive on a 
wreck.  During their descent, at a depth of 6m, one of the 
trainees experienced water entering his mask and he panicked.  
He was attached to the dive leader by a buddy line and this 
prevented the panicked diver from making a rapid ascent.  All 
three surfaced and were recovered into the boat.  No 
subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
July 2003 03/252 
During the ascent from a dive to 36m one of a pair of divers 
indicated that he was low on air.   
 
 
 
His buddy gave him his alternative air supply and they surfaced 
safely having completed a 5 min stop at 6m.  Their dive duration 
was 29 min. 
August 2003 03/224 
Two divers completed a 33 min dive to 21m with a 2 min stop at 
5m.  Once back on the surface one of the pair inhaled water and 
started to choke.  A rescue boat responded and brought the 
diver to the shore where he quickly recovered. 
August 2003 03/225 
A diver was participating in a deep diving training session with an 
instructor as his buddy.  6 min into the dive, at 35m, the diver 
indicated that he had a problem with his regulator.  The 
instructor gave him his alternative air source and they started to 
ascend.  At 18m the diver spat out the alternative air source and 
took the instructor's main regulator.  The instructor allowed this 
to happen and used the alternative air source himself.  The diver 
was very agitated, almost fighting.  The instructor managed to 
swap the regulators back again so as the diver would be on the 
longer hose.  The instructor held the regulator in the trainee's 
mouth and activated the purge to ensure that the diver had air 
during the rest of the ascent.  They made a rapid ascent from 
21m to the surface, where the alarm was raised and the divers 
were recovered from the water.  Their total dive time was 13 min.  
The troubled diver was not breathing but quickly responded to 
resuscitation techniques.  He was taken to hospital from where 
he was discharged, fit, the following day. 
September 2003 03/245 
A diver jumped into the water and this caused his pony regulator 
to free flow.  The cylinder was switched off and then on again to 
stop the free flow.  He then dived with his buddy to 32m.  At 32m 
he ran out of air and he took the alternative air source of his 
buddy.  They made a safe ascent to the surface.  It was then 
discovered that he had dived, in error, using his pony cylinder; 
his main cylinder was turned on and charged to 200 bar.  No ill 
effects were reported.

December 2002 03/414 
A rebreather diver dived to 89m.  10 min into the dive the zip of 
his drysuit failed, opening the full width of the zip.  He made his 
ascent to the surface including a total of 35 min decompression.  
The cold water forced him to surface missing the final 6 min of 
his decompression.  His buddy completed the full 
decompression.  The water temperature was 5 deg C.  He was 
placed on oxygen and drank water.  He was airlifted to a 
recompression facility where he received recompression 
treatment. 
January 2003 03/067 
Three divers descended a shotline to a depth of 24m.  One of 
the three realized that he was losing air.  He found that it was 
coming from his alternative air source and he signaled to one of 
the others.  His main regulator then developed a free flow.  The 
other diver offered his alternative air source which the first diver 
took.  During the ascent both regulators of the second diver 
started to free flow.  They continued to the surface.  At the 
surface the first diver left the water.  The second diver re-
descended with the third diver and the free flow stopped.  They 
continued their dive. The second diver then ran out of air even 
though his contents gauge did not read zero.  He used the 
alternative air source of the third diver and they ascended safely 
to the surface.  The water temperature was 3 deg C. 
April 2003 03/118 
Three divers descended to a depth of 15m.  At this depth one of 
the divers removed her mouthpiece and stuck her tongue out at 
one of the others.  This other diver returned the gesture.  His 
regulator then began to free flow.  He attempted to stop it but 
could not do so.  He placed it back in his mouth and continued 
to breathe from it.  The diver who had made the first gesture 
then offered her alternative air source to the diver with the free 
flow; he took it and started to breathe from it.  They started their 
ascent.  The third diver turned off the cylinder with the free flow 
but it continued to free flow when he turned it back on.  He 
turned it off again until they were at 2m.  The free flow stopped.  
At the surface the divers made themselves positively buoyant 
and returned to the shore.  No subsequent ill effects were 
reported. 
April 2003 03/190 
An instructor using a rebreather dived with a trainee on open 
circuit air.  They conducted a first dive without problem but 10 
min into the second dive, at a depth of 22m, the instructor 
experienced a build up of carbon dioxide.  He tried semi-closed 
operation but this did not help, he then switched to his 7 litre 
bail out cylinder which was filled with air.  He ascended to the 
surface and then swam to the shore where he safely left the 
water.  The trainee followed.  The diver reported that the 
scrubber was 40 min over its life of 120 min, but this had not 
been a problem previously.  The water temperature was 5 deg 
C and this may have impaired the scrubber's efficiency.  He 
reported that he had difficulty switching to his bail out because 
of his respiratory distress and high breathing rate, and that even 
after he had switched the symptoms persisted;  he took several 
hours to fully recover. 
May 2003 03/209 
Two divers conducted a dive to 35m using nitrox 28.  After 29 
min one of the pair deployed a delayed SMB in preparation for 
their ascent.  He used his primary regulator to inflate the SMB 
and breathed from his secondary regulator.  The SMB deployed 
correctly but the regulator began to free flow.  The divers were 
unable to stop the free flow.  The diver was using a twin cylinder 
system and his buddy was able to switch off the free flowing 
regulator.  They made a safe ascent, conducting a 5 min stop at 
6m. Neither diver suffered subsequent ill effects. 
May 2003 03/128 
Two divers made a dive to 9m.  One of the pair was diving in a 
drysuit, in open water, for the first time.  The suit was an 8 mm 
neoprene suit with a thick thermal undersuit.  He was weighted 
with 13 kg on a weightbelt and 7 kg in the weight system of his 
BCD.  During the dive this diver lost a weight from his BCD and 
became positively buoyant.  He was able to hold on to a 
submerged railing to prevent an uncontrolled ascent.  His buddy 
was unable to find the lost weight so he looped the line from a 
reel under the railing and back to the reel.  The buoyant diver 
then held on to the buddy and the buddy used the line to control 
their ascent.  Both reached the surface safely.  Their total dive 
time was 13 min.  The weight was recovered later. 
June 2003 03/126 
Two divers dived to a wreck in a maximum depth of 33m.  
Towards the end of the dive they ascended to the top of the 
wreck and one of the pair discovered that the manual wrist 
dump of his drysuit would not work.  They deployed a delayed 
SMB and began their ascent.  The diver released air from his 
suit by placing a finger down the wrist seal.  He managed to 
control his ascent to 6m but was unable to stop to conduct 
decompression and he continued to the surface.  He 
exchanged signals with his buddy who stopped to complete his 
decompression.  The diver who had missed decompression 
stops started his ascent with his computer indicating 3 min at 
3m.  This diver was recovered from the water and placed on 
oxygen for 15 min.  He experienced no symptoms of DCI and 
no further action was taken.  It is thought that the valve was 
prevented from working because it was blocked by the diver's 
undersuit. 
June 2003 03/428 
Three pairs of divers conducted a dive in a river to a maximum 
depth of 10m.  One of the divers was using a rebreather.  Each 
pair was connected by a buddy line.  About 28 min into the dive, 
at a depth of 8m, the buddy of the rebreather diver noticed that 
the buddy line had gone tight and was starting to pull him to the 
surface.  He saw that his buddy was floating above him, face 
upwards and that his arms were thrashing.  He pulled the buddy 
back down to him and saw that his lips and the skin around his 
face was blue.  At this point the rebreather diver's mouthpiece 
fell from his mouth and he stopped moving.  The buddy tried to 
replace the mouthpiece but the casualty's teeth were clenched 
shut.  The buddy attempted to bring them to the surface using 
the casualty's BCD but it would not inflate so he used his own 
buoyancy to bring them to the surface.  The water clarity was 
very low and water movement made it difficulty for him to retain 
grip on the casualty and to bring them to the surface.  Once at 
the surface he shouted for help and two walkers on the river 
bank responded; they used a mobile phone to call the 
emergency services.  At this point another buddy pair surfaced 
20m away and they swam to assist.  The buddy provided AV to 
the casualty and the three divers brought the casualty to the 
river bank where, with the help of the walkers, they removed 
him from the water.  Once ashore they continued applying 
resuscitation techniques.  The casualty, who was not breathing 
when landed, started to breath spontaneously and showed 

NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2003                          
©BSAC -2003   35 
signs of regaining consciousness.  The casualty and buddy 
were airlifted to hospital and the casualty was reported to be 
making a good recovery.  It is thought that the rebreather 
handsets had bumped along the riverbed during the dive and 
that this action had caused them to switch off, thus starving the 
diver of oxygen and causing him to fall unconscious. 
June 2003 03/139 
Two divers descended a shotline to a depth of 9m.  For one of 
the divers this was her third open water dive.  At the bottom of 
the shot this diver did not return the OK signal from the dive 
leader.  She then gave the out of air signal and spat out her 
regulator.  The dive leader offered his alternative air source.  
The troubled diver took this, then rejected it and repeated the 
out of air signal.  The dive leader purged the alternative air 
source and presented it again.  He then brought her to the 
surface using a controlled buoyant lift.  During the ascent the 
troubled diver breathed from the alternative air source with 
difficulty.  At the surface she quickly recovered.  She reported 
that her regulator seemed to be delivering water.  She went to 
hospital for a check up and was discharged after being given 
antibiotics and treated with a nebuliser.  No further ill effects 
were reported. 
June 2003 03/156 
A diver was operating an air compressor to recharge diving 
cylinders.  The filter tower drain valve was closed and no 
cylinder was attached.  The manifold was subjected to an over-
pressurization and the relief valve failed to operate.  As a result 
a safety disc at the bottom of the tower burst.  No one was 
injured.

Two divers began a descent to 25m.  At about 13m one of the 
pair began to get water in his regulator.  He flashed his torch at 
his buddy and tried to control his breathing with increasing 
flooding of his mouthpiece.  He gave his buddy the 'out of air' 
signal and his buddy provided his alternative air source.  Once 
control had been regained they made their ascent to the 
surface.  At the surface the diver with the problem regulator 
vomited as he had ingested water.  His only symptom was a 
stomach ache. 
July 2003 03/178 
Two divers conducted a dive to 55m.  One diver had a single 
cylinder filled with air and a 3l pony cylinder with nitrox 40.  His 
buddy was diving with trimix in twin 12l cylinders and he also 
carried side mounted cylinders.  The regulator of the diver with 
the single cylinder began to free flow and he signaled 'out of air' 
to his buddy.  The buddy provided him with an alternative air 
source and they ascended to a depth where the diver could use 
his nitrox 40, then they made a normal ascent to the surface.  
No subsequent ill effects were experienced.   The water 
temperature at depth was 2 deg C. 
July 2003 03/179 
A trainee found herself trying to breathe an air/water mixture at 
17m.  She made a rapid ascent to the surface followed by her 
instructor.  Once the trainee was safely out of the water the 
instructor re-descended.  Examination of the trainee's 
mouthpiece showed that there was a hole in it and that it was in 
a generally poor state.  Her alternative air source mouthpiece 
was in a similar condition. 
July 2003 03/182 
Two divers conducted a wreck dive to a depth of 42m.  At the 
end of the dive they were unable to relocate the shotline and, 
after a short search, they ascended to 35m.  One of the divers 
experienced problems with her drysuit dump valve and she 
made a rapid ascent to 25m before releasing the air through her 
neck seal.  She descended slightly then they re-ascended to 
25m.  At this depth one of the divers attempted to deploy a 
delayed SMB but the string tangled after the buoy was released 
and the SMB was abandoned.  The other diver deployed her 
delayed SMB and they made a normal ascent with a 27 min 
stop at 6m.  Their total dive time was 75 min.  During their stop 
another diver from their party descended to check that they 
were well and supplied air to one of them for the last 5 min.  
Both divers breathed oxygen for 1 hour after surfacing.  No 
subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
July 2003 03/181 
During the ascent from a 30 min dive to 20m a diver 
experienced problems with his mask flooding.  He was at 10m 
when the flooding started.  The dive leader managed to control 
the ascent to 3m but then had to let the troubled diver go to 
make his own ascent.  The ascent was a little fast.  At the 
surface the troubled diver was breathless and in a state of 
panic.  The dive leader surfaced soon afterwards and took 
control.  He secured the casualty and signaled the boat.  The 
diver was quickly recovered into the boat and soon regained his 
composure.  No subsequent ill effects were experienced.  The 
mask had been brought the day before.

An instructor and a trainee dived to 7m.  They became separated 
and surfaced.  They regrouped and re-descended.  A little later 
they became separated again, and resurfaced.  The trainee 
complained that his weightbelt was loose.  The instructor helped 
to tighten the belt and they re-descended.  The trainee then 
made for the surface again because the belt had become loose 
again.  At the surface the trainee was drifting away from the 
shore.  The instructor decided to land them both on a nearby 
rock.  The trainee was tired and out of air.  They waited on the 
rock for others in their party to locate them.  They were later 
picked up by a lifeboat.  Surface visibility was restricted due to 
fog.

Dive support vessel reported two overdue divers, after 
requesting lifeboat launch, the divers were recovered by own 
boat, all resources stood down.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2003 03/417 
A dive party found a metal object 3m long by 0.6m diameter 
floating 2.5 miles offshore.  They contacted the Coastguard and 
reported it as a potential hazard, gave its position and marked it 
with an orange buoy.  Later that day they relocated it and 
informed the Coastguard.  Two spar buoys had gone missing in 
the area and it was thought to be one of these.  With the 
agreement of the Coastguard the object was towed into a marina 
and tied up to the jetty.  It was later discovered to be part of a 
WWII torpedo and bomb disposal experts were called to deal 
with it.  It did not contain any explosives. 
June 2003 03/144 
Three divers entered the water intending to descend a shotline to 
a wreck in a depth of 31m.  There was a slight current and the 
divers were carried away from the shot buoy.  They decided to 
descend away from the shotline and during the descent they 
became separated.  One of the group deployed a delayed SMB 
and surfaced after 5 min.  The remaining two divers re-
established contact with each other at the bottom of the shotline.  
Noticing the missing diver, the dive leader waited and looked 
around and then gave the signal to ascend.  The third diver 
ignored this signal and swam away to dive alone.  The dive 
leader ascended and surfaced with a dive time of 10 min.  After a 
while, when there was no sighting of the third diver, the 
Coastguard was alerted and a search commenced.  The bubbles 
of the third diver were located and a thunderflash was used as a 
recall signal.  The third diver did not surface.  Two other divers 
were preparing to enter the water when the solo diver surfaced 
after a dive of 50 min.  A maximum dive time of 40 min had been 
agreed to allow a second wave of divers but this second wave 
was cancelled. 
August 2003 03/363

Overseas Incidents 
 
 
Fatalities 
September 2003 03/235 
A group of ten divers conducted a dive on a wreck.  One of the 
divers entered a part of the wreck which had previously been 
inaccessible.  Once inside the wreck the visibility quickly 
reduced and the diver was unable to find his way out.  His body 
was recovered the following day. 
 
 
Decompression Illness 
December 2002 03/044 
A diver conducted a series of dives whilst on vacation.  
Typically she dived twice per day, the first dive to around 30m 
and the second to around 16m with a 45 min to 60 min surface 
interval.  She dived for five days and then had a break of two 
days.  She then dived for two days then had a one day break 
and dived for a further two days.  Finally after a further one day 
break she dived for a further three days.  During the third from 
last day she experienced shoulder pain, but she attributed this 
to a muscle strain sustained whilst standing up awkwardly.  The 
pain did not worsen and she had no other symptoms so she 
continued to dive.  20 hours after the last dive she undertook a 
12 hour flight home followed by shorter domestic flight.  At the 
start of the flight the pain had almost gone.  During the descent 
from the first flight she felt pain again.  Between flights the pain 
subsided but became apparent during the second descent.  The 
following day she was able to obtain medical advice and she 
was referred to a hyperbaric facility where she was treated for 
DCI. 
January 2003 03/415 
A diver completed three dives per day over a six day period.  All 
dives were less than 30m and only one involved decompression 
stops.  27 hours after his last dive he began a flight home.  
During the flight he noticed a slight 'pins and needles' in his left 
foot which disappeared when he stood up.  The next day he 
had a headache.  48 hours after his last dive he developed a 
slight 'pounding' in his left shoulder, a tingling in his left arm, an 
ache in his left wrist and elbow, and intermittent aches in his 
back and neck.  He sought medical advice and received 
recompression treatment.  He suffered aching muscles for the 
following week but made a full recovery. 
April 2003 03/416 
A diver received recompression treatment for a suspected type 
2 DCI. 
May 2003 03/103 
Three divers conducted a dive to a depth of 27m.  When one of 
the divers reached 100 bar he signaled the ascent.  They 
deployed a delayed SMB and made their ascent.  They had 
planned to stop at 6m but one of the divers did not do this.  
Their total dive time was 22 min.  The divers were recovered 
into their boat.  Shortly afterwards, the diver who had missed 
the stop complained of a headache and began to vomit.  He 
was placed on oxygen.  He was allowed to float at the surface 
to remove him from the movement of the boat.  He was then 
transferred to another boat, placed on oxygen and taken to the 
shore.  His condition did not improve so he was taken to 
hospital and from there to a recompression facility where he 
was treated for a mild case of DCI. 
 
 
Illness / Injury 
October 2002 03/010 
A diver completed a 40 min dive to a maximum depth of 15m.  
At the surface he had to wait about 10 min to be picked up as 
the boat was recovering other divers.  In the swell he was 
violently sick.  By the time he was back on shore he had 
recovered apart from a sore throat caused by his having been 
sick.  That evening he did not eat because of his throat but he 
did drink water and fruit juice.  Early the following morning he 
noticed a rash under both arms.  He was placed on oxygen for 
10 min and felt well.  The next morning medical advice was 
sought.  The diver was cleared to dive again the following day. 
November 2002 03/042 
10 min into a dive, at a depth of 14m, a diver looked into an 
underwater cave.  He steadied himself with his left arm against 
the rocks and used a torch to look deeper into the cave.  At this 
point he was bitten behind his left elbow by a large Moray eel 
that he had not seen.  A small amount of blood came from two 
small holes in his wetsuit.  After a short period he aborted the 
dive.  Once out of the water he discovered that he had two deep 
cuts in his arm 25mm and 50mm in length.  He was taken to 
hospital where the wounds were closed with nine stitches.  
(Related to 03/040) 
March 2003 03/076 
A diver completed a 41 min dive to a maximum depth of 39m 
with a 7 min stop at 3m.  2 hours 25 min later he dived again, 
this time to 31m for 44 min with a 12 min stop at 3m.  10 min 
after surfacing he noticed a pain in his upper left arm.  This was 
assumed to have been a muscle strain caused by moving twin-
sets around.  Early the following morning the pain was still 
present and medical advice was sought.  As a precaution the 
diver was recompressed.  After this treatment the pain was 
unresolved.  The diver was given an intravenous drip and pain 
killers.  2 hours later the pain had subsided.  The diver was 
given further pain killers and kept in hospital overnight for 
observation.  A muscular strain was finally diagnosed and 
further pain relief was prescribed. 
April 2003 03/084 
A boat with four divers onboard approached a jetty to unload 
equipment.  Two of the divers were unable to lift some of the 
diving equipment since it was too heavy.  The cox asked one of 
these divers to take the helm whilst he unloaded the equipment.  
This diver was not experienced at boat handling and she was 
given brief instructions on what to do by the cox.  Whilst 
unloading was taking place a swell developed and the cox 
moved back down the boat to take control again.  Whilst he was 
moving the boat was hit by a large swell and the cox was 
thrown overboard.  His legs were hit by the moving propeller.  
He was recovered from the water and taken to hospital  where 
he needed treatment under local anesthetic.  Others helped to 
recover the boat, equipment and remaining divers. 
August 2003 03/226 
A diver and an instructor completed a 32 min dive to a 
maximum depth of 38m.  During their ascent they completed a 

  NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2003 
38  ©BS-AC - 2003 
1 min stop at 9m, a 3 min stop at 6m and a 3 min stop at 3m.  
These stops were not required by their computers but were 
completed as a training exercise.  During the 3m stop the 
instructor began to feel dizzy and he developed a pain in his 
chest.  Once out of the water he was placed on oxygen.  He 
complained of having been cold during the dive and seemed to 
be in mild shock.  The emergency services were alerted and the 
boat returned to shore.  The casualty was taken by ambulance 
to hospital.  He was examined and the diagnosis was of 
possible cold shock.  He was discharged from hospital the 
following day.  The surface water temperature was 28 deg C 
and the seabed temperature was 18 deg C.  The casualty had 
been wearing a 3mm full body wetsuit, and he was described as 
having little body fat. 
September 2003 03/238 
A trainee had difficulty clearing her ear during a pool training 
session.  She visited her doctor and her ear was found to be 
red with a red line on the eardrum.  A week later the trainee 
reported that the ear had been rested and cleared much more 
easily.  She under took a dive to a depth of 9m.  After the dive 
she found that she was able to blow air out of her right ear.  A 
medical examination revealed a perforation to her eardrum.  
She had not experienced any pain, dizziness or discomfort 
during the dive. 
 
 
Boating / Surface Incidents 
October 2002 03/204 
A pair of divers dived from the back of a moored live-aboard 
dive boat whilst two RHIBs ferried divers to another site.  The 
divers planned to descend to a plateau below the boat.  They 
dived to 36m and then, after 13 min ascended back towards the 
mooring line.  As they approached the mooring line in a depth 
of 18m they were caught by a current which carried them back 
down to 28m.  They re-ascended and deployed a delayed SMB 
at 6m.  They conducted a 3 min safety stop and then surfaced.  
Their dive time was 25 min.  At the surface they were about 
400m from the boat and being carried away from it.  They 
attempted to attract the attention of those in the boat with a 
whistle and by waving the SMB but they were not seen; the 
wind was against them and the sun was behind them.  They 
drifted for over 90 min in 1m high waves until they were 
eventually found and recovered by one of the RHIBs.  They 
were safely recovered back to the boat. 
June 2003 03/157 
A solo diver launched a delayed SMB during a 45 min dive to a 
maximum depth of 17m.  Upon surfacing he found that he had 
lost contact with his boat.  The current was against the wind 
and there was a breaking swell about 2m high.  The diver could 
see the boat when he was at the top of a wave but they could 
not see him.  He started to swim towards the shore.  The boat 
crew alerted the Coastguard and a search involving two 
lifeboats, a helicopter and other craft was initiated.  The search 
took place away from the area in which the diver was carried.  
He was eventually spotted by a yacht that had been involved in 
the search but was leaving the area.  The yacht relayed the 
diver's position and he was recovered by lifeboat after being at 
the surface for 3 hours.  He was airlifted to hospital but released 
after a brief check. 
August 2003 03/219 
Five divers were traveling in a dory to a dive site.  20 min into 
the journey the low oil warning for the port engine sounded.  
The boat was stopped and the oil was checked, but nothing 
untoward was found.  The alarm was weak and intermittent and 
was thought to be due to faulty wiring; the boat had previously 
had a wiring problem.  The engines were restarted and the 
journey continued.  10 min later this engine suddenly lost all 
power.  A small leak was found in the oil reservoir.  Attempts 
were made to repair the hole during which an oil pipe was lost 
overboard.  The engine casing became flooded with seawater 
and oil.  An electrical short then developed and the main engine 
wiring loom started smoking profusely and a cable connector 
started to melt.  There was concern that disconnecting the 
cable from the battery, which was in the bilge, would ignite any 
fumes that might have been in the bilge.  Eventually the 
electrical connection to the engine was disconnected.  The boat 
then returned safely to harbour.  Both engines had been dealer 
serviced within the previous six months. 
 
 
Ascents 
November 2002 03/033 
An instructor and two trainees began a dive to a depth of 9m.  
They then ascended to 6m at which point the weightbelt of one 
of the trainees became loose and fell off.  The instructor caught 
the belt but was not able to hold on to the trainee.  The other 
trainee took hold of the buoyant diver and they made a rapid 
ascent to the surface.  The instructor then surfaced and they 
got back into the boat.  Both were monitored for symptoms of 
DCI but none were apparent. 
March 2003 03/117 
Two divers completed a dive to a maximum depth of 43m.  
Their dive time was 51 min which included a 3 min stop at 6m 
and a 16 min stop at 3m.  Upon surfacing it was noted that both 
their computers indicated missed stops.  One of the computers 
indicated that 3 min had been missed at 3m the other just 
indicated missing stops at 3m.  Both divers were placed on 
oxygen and returned to shore.  Medical advice was sought and 
the divers received one session of recompression treatment.  
No symptoms of DCI were experienced at any time. 
April 2003 03/088 
Two divers dived to a wreck at a depth of 34m.  Towards the 
end of the dive they made their way to the mast of the wreck 
and one of the divers deployed a delayed SMB.  During the 
deployment he lost control of his buoyancy and began to 
ascend.  His buddy took hold of him and brought him back to 
the mast.  They then ascended to 15m and began a swim back 
to the shore.  During this swim, the diver lost control of his 
buoyancy for a second time and ascended to the surface.  His 
buddy followed, making a 1 min stop at 6m.  At the surface the 
buddy checked that all was well and towed him back to the 
shore.  The dive duration was 20 min.  It was subsequently 
established that the delayed SMB had been attached to the 
diver during its deployment.  No subsequent ill effects 
July 2003 03/196 
Two divers conducted a dive on a wreck to a maximum depth of 
38m.  One of the divers had a problem with his mask leaking.  
After a dive time of 20 min the computer of one of the divers 
indicated a 17 min ascent time.  They located what they thought 
was the shotline and began their ascent.  This line turned out to 
be an old shotline which had been cut at 24m.  Both divers 
deployed delayed SMBs, but in doing so they sank back down 
to the seabed at 37m.  Their ascent time had increased to 30 
min.  They ascended to 6m where one of the divers' computers 
indicated that a 33 min stop was required.  The diver with a 
flooding mask continued to experience problems and he did not 
reel in the SMB line during his ascent.  The line became tangled 
around the other diver.  In rough and moving water they 
struggled to maintain their decompression depth.  Finally they 
were pulled to the surface by the SMB which was affected by a 

NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2003                          
©BSAC - 2003   39 
strong current.  They missed an indicated 28 min 
decompression.  Both divers were recovered into the boat and 
placed on oxygen.  The Coastguard was alerted and the divers 
were airlifted to a recompression facility. Both divers were 
recompressed although the only symptom experienced was a 
slight shoulder pain by one of the pair. 
August 2003 03/198 
A diver and a trainee undertook a dive to a depth of 16m.  After 
about 16 min, the fin of the diver caught on the weightbelt of the 
trainee causing it to become undone.  The weightbelt fell to the 
seabed and the trainee was unable to hold on to it.  The buddy 
tried to slow the ascent but both were carried to the surface.  
They were recovered into their boat and placed on oxygen.  
Medical advice was sought.  Once ashore both divers were kept 
on oxygen for a further 1 hour.  No symptoms of DCI were 
experienced. 
 
 
Technique 
November 2002 03/034 
A diver under took a led dive with a dive school whilst on 
vacation.  She dived with two other divers and the dive leader.  
Prior to the dive she noticed that air was leaking from the high 
pressure hose of her regulator.  The instructor attempted to fix 
the problem and slowed the leak.  They dived to a maximum 
depth of 10m.  The diver with the leaking regulator indicated to 
the dive leader when she reached 100 bar, and again at 50 bar.  
At this point one of the other divers was out of air and was using 
the dive leader's alternative air source to continue the dive.  The 
diver with the leak was then at 5m with 10 bar indicated on her 
gauge.  They then swam under a rock ledge at which point the 
regulator became hard to breathe from.  She surfaced to find 
herself in waves breaking strongly against the rocks.  She was 
churned around in the water; pushed under the overhang and 
then thrown back to the surface.  The other diver came to her 
aid, gave her his alternative air source and helped her away 
from the rocks.  She orally inflated her BCD.  The dive leader 
then surfaced and assisted her back to the shore.  Once out of 
the water the diver was shocked and distressed.  The diver 
states that the cylinder pressure gauge read 10 bar when it was 
empty. 
November 2002 03/043 
A trainee and another diver were conducting assisted ascents 
from a depth of 10m.  The first ascent took place with the 
trainee using his alternative air source.  During the ascent the 
other diver's regulator began to free flow.  He was not able to 
stop it and they continued to the surface.  At the surface they 
drifted out of the shelter of the shore into choppy water and a 
boat was launched to recover them.  The diver with the free flow 
stated that he may have knocked the venturi control of his 
regulator into the 'minus' position as he took it from his mouth.  
No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
January 2003 03/045 
Two divers entered the water and planned a no stop dive to a 
maximum depth of 30m with a 3 min safety stop at 6m.  During 
the descent they lost buoyancy control and reached the bottom 
at 39m.  They re-ascended and stabilized at 25m.  They were 
low on air and therefore made an ascent directly to the surface.  
Once out of the water their computers were checked and it was 
determined that they had exceeded the maximum ascent rate.  
The divers did not dive again for 48 hours.  No adverse effects 
were experienced. 
May 2003 03/208 
Two divers commenced a shore dive by swimming through a 
tunnel to the open sea.  The tunnel was open to the air at the 
surface.  They turned and swam along a cliff wall to a maximum 
depth of 23m.  When their air reached 120 bar they turned to 
retrace their route but higher up the wall at a depth of 13m.  
They reached what they thought was the tunnel entrance and 
swam in.  However this turned out to be a cave and the swell 
made it difficult for them to swim out again.  Outside the tunnel 
one of the pair ran out of air and used the alternative air source 
of the other.  They surfaced and swam back on the surface.  
Neither diver suffered any ill effects. 
 
 
Equipment 
November 2002 03/041 
Three divers undertook a dive to a maximum depth of 27m.  
They then returned to 8m to investigate a cave.  A strong swell 
was present and the divers used this to move forward.  Whilst 
being carried forward the BCD emergency cylinder control valve 
of one of the divers brushed against the rocks and this turned it 
on.  The diver was carried upwards but managed to regain 
buoyancy control and returned to his buddies.  He estimates 
that he rose 3m during this problem.  No subsequent ill effects 
were experienced. 
August 2003 03/220 
Three divers undertook a dive to a planned maximum depth of 
40m.  During the dive one of the group noticed that his dive 
computer read 53m and he started to ascend whilst preparing 
to deploy a delayed SMB.  The other divers followed him but 
lost sight of him at 28m.  The lone diver surfaced with his 
computer reading 53m, 30 min dive time and 12 min of missed 
decompression stops.  The other two divers carried out 3 min of 
decompression as indicated by their computers and then 
surfaced.  Checks were made of the divers' instruments and it 
was found that the computer which read 53m had 
malfunctioned.  The diver had not been deeper than 40m.  As 
he ascended his computer was stuck on 53m and he thought 
that he was being carried down by a current, this caused him to 
swim harder for the surface.  This diver was placed on oxygen 
and the Coastguard was informed.  The diver was taken by 
ambulance to hospital, he had a 'fuzzy head' and was confused 
about the incident.  The diver suffered no subsequent ill effects. 
 
 
Miscellaneous 
November 2002 03/040 
A pair of divers conducted a 52 min dive to a depth of 16m.  
During the dive, at a depth of 14m, the divers were exploring a 
small underwater cliff.  This cliff contained a small cave with 
crayfish in it.  One of the divers moved into it.  He then noticed a 
large moray eel in the cave and backed out.  3m to his right was 
another similar cave again containing crayfish.  He moved 
towards this cave.  The eel then came from its cave and seized 
the diver's day-glo hood which it shook violently.  The hood was 
pulled from the diver's head and his mask was displaced.  With 
his buddy's help he recovered and refitted his mask.  The eel
