Introduction
This booklet contains the 2004 Diving Incidents Report, produced by The British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC) in the
interest of promoting diving safety.  It is important to note that it contains details of UK diving incidents occurring
to divers of all affiliations, plus incidents occurring worldwide involving BSAC members.
Report Format
The majority of statistical information contained within this report is also shown in graphical form.  Please note that all
statistical information is produced from UK data only and does not include Overseas Incidents unless noted as ‘All
Incidents’.
The contents of this report are split into an overview of the year, and then the details of nine incident categories plus some
historical analyses.  The various sections can be found as shown below:-
i) Overview Page 1
ii) Fatalities Page 5
iii) Decompression Incidents Page  8
iv) Injury / illness Page 18
v) Boating & Surface Incidents Page 24
vi) Ascent Problems Page 30
vii) Technique Problems Page 38
viii) Equipment Problems Page 40
ix) Miscellaneous Incidents Page 42
x) Overseas Incidents Page 43
xi) Numerical & Statistical Analyses Page 46
xii) List of Abbreviations Page 48
Within each category the incidents are listed in the order of their occurrence, not necessarily that of Incident Reference.
They are laid out in the following form:

The nature of many diving incidents is such that there is usually more than one cause or effect.  Where this is the case the
incident has been classified under the more appropriate cause or effect. For instance an incident involving a fast ascent,
causing decompression illness, will be classified under 'Decompression Incidents'.

Overview
has seen an increase in the number of incidents
reported.  This reverses the situation reported
last year where a significant drop in reported
incidents occurred.  The following chart shows the pattern over
the last 14 years.  The downward trend seen in 2002 and 2003
has not continued.  In the previous decade the number of
reported incidents increased by about 20 per year; it is possible
that we are now seeing a levelling off at around 400 per year.

The distribution of reported incidents is shown in the following
chart.  As can be seen, 69% of these incidents have occurred in
the summer period.  T consistent with previous
years, reflecting the incr r of dives that take place
during the warmer weather.
There is a slight and unusual dip in June, but this probably
reflects the weather conditions during that month.

Incidents by category
The incident database categorises all incidents into one of nine
major categories, and the following chart shows the distribution
of the 2004 incidents into those categories.
The highest number of incidents relates to ‘Decompression
Illness (DCI)' and this is consistent with previous years.
'Boating and Surface' incidents are the second largest category
and the 2004 numbers continue the previously identified trend
of a steady decline in this type of incident.  More reliable and
better-serviced engines and divers taking more care to ensure
that they don't become lost are at the heart of this improvement.
A worrying trend is the increase in the number of incidents in
the 'Ascent' category, which has increased by 50% over the
average of the last six years.  This group of incidents relates to
incorrect ascent procedure where no subsequent problem
arose.  Many rapid ascents result in a DCI and as such would
be placed in the 'DCI' category.
Typically a diver loses control of his or her buoyancy during the
ascent and makes an uncontrolled ascent to the surface, often
missing decompression stops.  Typical reasons are distraction
whilst deploying a delayed surface marker buoy, jamming of the
delayed SMB reel and lack of skill with drysuit buoyancy control.
All of these are avoidable by the use of correct techniques,
good training, sufficient practice and correct equipment
maintenance.

• Five cases involved groups of three divers diving together

above.
• Four cases involved equipment issues.
One case involved a cylinder that was turned off.
One case involved a rebreather that was not set up
correctly before the dive.
One case involved a BCD that the diver was not familiar
with.
In the fourth case the specific issue was not made clear.
• Four cases involved divers diving deeper than 50m.
One involved a diver at 58m breathing air.
One involved a diver whose body was found at a depth of
67m.
The last case involved a double fatality where the divers'
bodies were found at 70m.
• Three cases involved divers running out of breathing gas.
In one case this was as the result of an entanglement and
associated problems.
In one case it was the primary cause of the incident.
In the last case it would appear that a diver accidentally
used his pony cylinder regulator at the start of the dive and
problems arose when this cylinder unexpectedly ran out.
• Two cases involved rebreathers.
Often multiple causes were involved in an incident and in
thirteen of these fatal incidents there is insufficient information
available to be clear about the exact chain of events and root
causes.
Finally there was one reported fatality overseas that indirectly
involved a BSAC member.
25 fatalities in the incident year is a high number but to some
extent this number arises because of the timing of the fatal
incidents themselves.  The following chart shows the number of
fatalities by quarter year for the last seven years.

It can be seen that the pattern of the last four quarters is not
inconsistent with previous quarters.
We should not be complacent about these incidents, clearly
each is a tragedy for those involved and we must do all that we
can to identify the causes and to make recommendations
accordingly.  On the other hand we must avoid jumping to a
conclusion that some dramatic change must have taken place
to cause this increase.
Incident depths

The pattern of depths in the 0m to 50m range is very similar to
that normally seen and reflects the amount of diving that takes
place in these depth ranges.  The number of incidents reported
in the greater than 50m range is 14, which is in line with
previous years.  However 4 of these 14 were fatal incidents,
clearly indicating the risks associated with deep diving.
The BSAC advises that no air dive should be deeper than 50m,
and that dives to 50m should only be conducted by divers who
are appropriately trained and qualified.
The recommended limit for divers trained to Sports Diver
standard is 35m and then only when they have received
appropriate training for diving at this depth.

Our call upon the RNLI in the 2004 incident year is slightly up
from 2003 but the overall picture is one of a steady decline in
the use of lifeboats to assist divers.  I think that there are two
factors here.  Firstly, engine failures and lost divers are
reducing, as I indicated earlier.  Secondly, as highlighted later,
more incidents are being resolved by the use of helicopters.

In 2004 135 incidents involve the use of helicopters, and this is
the highest number recorded.
Helicopters are tasked to support searches for missing divers
and to transport divers with DCI to recompression facilities.  In
the mid 90s helicopters were involved in about 20% of diving

Decompression Incidents
The BSAC database contains 121 reports of DCI incidents in
the 2004 incident year, some of which involved more than one
casualty.  When these multiple cases are counted the result is
126 cases of DCI.
In 2003 132 cases of DCI were recorded, 168 in 2002, 116 in
2001, 134 in 2000 and 86 in 1999.
An analysis of the causal factors associated with the cases for
2004 indicates the following major features:-
33 involved diving to deeper than 30m
28 involved repeat diving
27 involved rapid ascents
13 involved missed decompression stops
Some cases involved more than one of these causes.
The report includes several cases of ‘Diver illness’ reported by
the RNLI and whilst the nature of this illness is not recorded by
the RNLI it is very likely that these are further cases of DCI.
As reported many times before, poor buoyancy control is at the
heart of the majority of these cases.  Divers are failing to
correctly control their ascent, especially in the critical last 10m
zone and are ending up with rapid ascents and/or missed
decompression stops.  Very often the diver is using a drysuit
and is unable to prevent a buoyant ascent.
Divers continue to have problems with the deployment of
delayed surface marker buoys – reels jam, equipment gets
caught and divers are dragged to the surface.  The very piece
of equipment that is supposed to increase the safety of an
ascent is having just the reverse effect.
This is an area where more training and practice is clearly
needed.
 Dehydration continues to be an aggravating factor in DCI cases
and this is sometimes made worse by excessive alcohol
consumption the night before.
Multi-day dive trips are also an area of concern.  Divers are
neglecting to take the recommended mid-week break from
diving and developing DCI as a result.
Conclusions
Key conclusions are:-
• Reported incidents are in line with the trends of recent
years.
• The number of fatalities has risen substantially in the 2004
incident year.
o No new causal factors have been identified and there is
no evidence to suggest that any changes are required
to the current recommendations for safe diving
practices.
o Non-diving-related medical problems were above
normal.
o A failure to achieve positive buoyancy once a problem
was encountered was present in a high number of
cases.
o Non-pair diving may have contributed by providing a
distraction that allowed a problem with another member
of the team to go unnoticed.
o Increasing depth significantly increases the difficulty of
resolving an incident satisfactorily.   4 of the 14
incidents with depths of greater than 50m involved
fatalities.
• Training in safe ascent procedures should be a high priority
for branches and instructors.
Most of the incidents reported within this document could have
been avoided had those involved followed a few basic principles
of safe diving practice.  The BSAC publishes a booklet called
'Safe Diving' (latest edition May 2002).  This booklet
summarises all the key elements of safe diving and is available
to all, free of charge, through BSAC HQ.
Remember you can never have too much practice and the
further you stay away from the limits of your own personal
capabilities the more likely you are to continue to enjoy your
diving.
Please browse through the details in this report and use them to
learn from others’ mistakes. They have had the courage and
generosity to record their experiences for publication, the least
that we can do is to use this information to avoid similar
problems.
Finally, if you must have an incident please report it on our
Incident Report form, available free from BSAC HQ or via the
BSAC website.
As always, your anonymity is assured – great care is taken to
preserve the confidentiality of any personal information
recorded in BSAC Incident Reports.

Fatalities
October 2003 04/001
A 65 year old diver completed a dive to a maximum depth of
32m and got back into the boat.  The end of the dive had been
exhausting and he complained of feeling tired and unwell.
Others helped him remove his diving kit and he was placed on
oxygen and laid down.  He moved to a cabin in the boat.  He
then became unconscious and resuscitation techniques were
applied.  Emergency services were dispatched to assist but the
diver failed to recover.  It is thought that he suffered a heart
attack.
October 2003 04/002
A diver was reported missing after a wreck dive.  Later that day
divers from the same party located his body on the wreck but
were unable to recover it.  Police and Navy divers recovered the
body from 45m, six days later.
October 2003 04/004
A diver surfaced unconscious from a 25 min dive to 25m.  The
casualty was recovered into the boat and the Coastguard was
alerted.  The casualty was airlifted to hospital but he failed to
recover.  It is thought that he suffered a heart attack.
October 2003 04/003
A diver got into difficulties during a wreck dive.  At the surface
he was in a heavy swell and he had difficulty in obtaining
buoyancy.  He removed his mask and his regulator.  He was
pulled onto rocks by two buddies.  These divers applied
resuscitation techniques to the casualty and called the
emergency services.  He was brought ashore by lifeboat and
then airlifted to hospital but he failed to recover.  It was
subsequently determined that the diver had drowned.
December 2003 04/043
Two divers conducted a dive to 58m.  One used air for the dive
and carried nitrox 75 for decompression, the other, the dive
leader, used a rebreather with trimix 10/50 as the diluent.  The
divers swam through a 20m long tunnel at a depth of 57m. The
tunnel contained a slack guide rope running through it.  When
the dive leader reached the end of the tunnel he turned to check
his buddy and saw that the rope was snagging his buddy's side
mount cylinder and slowing him down.  The dive leader
approached him to free the line.  He noticed that the buddy
seemed agitated.  He gave him the OK signal but the buddy
turned and started to swim quickly back into the tunnel.  As he
did so the rope snagged on his fin.  The dive leader followed,
continually freeing the line from his buddy's fin.  4 to 5m from
the end of the tunnel the buddy stopped and kicked the
mouthpiece from the dive leader's mouth.   The dive leader
replaced his mouthpiece but noticed that his buddy had no
regulator in his mouth and that he was pointing at one of his
mouthpieces.  The dive leader offered the buddy one of the
buddy's regulators, pressing the purge as he did so.  He noticed
that only a little air flowed.  The buddy would not take this
regulator and the dive leader then offered his own alternative air
source.  Again the buddy would not take this and he then lost
consciousness.  The dive leader attempted to pull him out of the
tunnel but he was snagged on the line.  He managed to free the
line and pulled the casualty out of the tunnel.  He was unable to
inflate the buddy's BCD as no air seemed to be available.  He
used his own buoyancy to start the ascent.  During the ascent
the casualty became inverted and the dive leader was unable to
vent his suit.  At about 30m the ascent was so rapid that he was
unable to hold on to the casualty.  He let go and made a fast
ascent to the surface missing a substantial amount of
decompression stop time.  At the surface he found the casualty
floating with his nose just clear of the water.  He started to give
AV and towed the casualty to the shore.  The AV was inhibited
by the over-inflated drysuit but the dive leader thought that the
casualty would sink if he dumped air.  He got the casualty to the
shore and after removing both sets of equipment he dragged
him onto a rock.  He deflated the casualty's suit and started AV
again.  He ran to his car and phoned the emergency services
then returned to continue resuscitation attempts.  The
emergency services arrived and continued resuscitation but this
was not successful and the casualty died at the scene.  The
buddy, who was not showing any signs of DCI, was airlifted to a
recompression facility for precautionary treatment.  The
casualty's main air supply was a twin cylinder configuration
each with its own regulator.  It is thought that he had a regulator
free flow in the tunnel and that he turned this cylinder off and
reached for his second regulator, only to find that it was
switched off, which caused him to panic.  The Coroner's inquest
cited nitrogen narcosis as a contributory factor.
February 2004 04/093
Two divers conducted a dive to a depth of 22m.  Some time into
the dive, one of the pair indicated that she had 50 bar
remaining.  Her buddy indicated that they should ascend to a
shallower depth.  They started to ascend and the diver who was
low on air started to rise too rapidly.  She then dumped too
much air and started to sink again.  This process was repeated
and she failed to ascend.  She began to fin which caused her to
move away from her buddy.  Her buddy stopped his ascent,
swam towards the troubled diver and took hold of her.  They
then sank back to the bottom and the buddy failed to equalize
the pressure in his mask and ears.  He thought that he was
going to lose consciousness.  He cleared his mask and saw his
buddy kneeling on the bottom without a regulator in her mouth.
He tried to give her his alternative air source but she would not
take it.  She then took the regulator from his mouth.  He tried to
reach his back-up regulator but in the confusion his mask was
pulled off.  He sprang back and the buoyancy in his suit and
BCD brought him to the surface.  He raised the alarm and other
divers quickly recovered the other diver and removed her from
the water.  Resuscitation techniques were applied and the diver
was taken to hospital where she later died.  The buddy suffered
a serious mask squeeze and was taken to a recompression
facility where he received treatment.
March 2004 04/103
A diver was diving with two companions when he got into
difficulties.  He became separated from his buddies.  A nearby
group of divers came to assist.  They brought the casualty to
the surface and resuscitation techniques were applied.  He was
airlifted to hospital but declared dead on arrival.
March 2004 04/105
A diver completed a 35 min dive to a depth of 37m with a 3 min
stop at 3m.  3 hours 26 min later he dived again to a depth of
29m.  During the dive he became separated from his buddy and
surfaced.  At the surface he was seen to be in distress.  The
dive boat skipper recovered another diver from the shotline and
then went to assist the distressed diver.  He managed to grab
hold of the diver but was unable to maintain his grip.  The diver
who had been recovered from the shot dekitted and attempted
to help but the boat was swept away from the distressed diver.
He was negatively buoyant and began to sink.  He did not

appear to be breathing and did not have a regulator in his
mouth.  A surface and underwater search was initiated, but the
diver was not found.  The diver's body was located by an ROV,
50m from the dive site, thirteen days later and it was recovered
the following day.
March 2004 04/112
A diver experienced buoyancy problem with his new BCD whilst
underwater.  He began to sink.  His buddy attempted to assist
him but had to let go when they reached 50m.  The buddy made
a fast ascent to the surface.  The lost diver's body was found
the following day, at a depth of 67m, by a police diving team
using an ROV.

At the end of a day's diving at an inland site a car was found to
be remaining in the car park.  It was determined that two divers
were missing.  Their bodies were recovered from underwater
four days later.  The depth at which they were found was
reported to be around 70m.   (Media reports).
April 2004 04/118
A group of divers arrived at a wreck site to conduct a series of
dives.  The first pair entered the water but the current was too
strong and they were swept passed the shot buoy.  They were
recovered into the boat.  Approximately 30 min later a second
pair commenced their dive and, despite a 1.5 knot current, they
reached the buoy and started their dive.  At 10m the current
was about 0.5 knot.  There was a brief slack period and then
the current started again.  The first pair and a third pair of divers
then entered the water and started their descent down the
shotline, one behind the other.  The third pair reached the wreck
at a depth of 22m and swam away from the shot.  One diver
from the first pair noticed that her buddy was not with her and
she waited at the bottom of the shot.  After several min of
waiting and searching she deployed a delayed SMB and started
her ascent.  At the same time a second delayed SMB was also
seen to break the surface by those in the boat.  The lone diver
completed her ascent and was recovered into the boat.  The
other delayed SMB was seen to be drifting.  It was recovered
into the boat.  Approximately 30m of line was attached to the
partially inflated buoy and the winding handle of the reel was
found to be broken off.  The other two pairs of divers completed
their dives and were recovered into the boat.  At this point the
Coastguard was alerted that a diver was missing.   An extensive
surface involving two helicopters, a lifeboat and other craft was
made.  An underwater search was also made but the missing
diver was not found.  Police divers recovered the diver's body,
from close to the wreck, eight days later
May 2004 04/148
A diver undertook her second dive of the day.  At a depth of
10m she indicated that she had a problem and made a rapid
ascent to the surface.  The emergency services were alerted
and the diver was taken to the shore.  Resuscitation techniques
were applied but the diver failed to recover.  (Media reports).
May 2004 04/158
Three divers were conducting a shore dive to a maximum depth
of 9m.  They surfaced and one of the three got into difficulties.
His buddies attempted to assist him but he sank beneath the
surface.  The emergency services were alerted and the missing
diver's body was recovered from the seabed later that day.
(Media report).
May 2004 04/171
A group of divers were diving from a harbour wall.  On entering
the water, one diver decided that he needed more weight and
he returned to the harbour wall.  He then collapsed.  Other
divers assisted and resuscitation techniques were applied.  The
emergency services attended but the diver was pronounced
dead at the scene.  The casualty was reported to have had a fit
whilst in the water.
May 2004 04/172
Three divers using rebreathers prepared to make a dive to a
maximum depth of 60m.  One of them waited in the water for
the others to finish kitting up as he was warm.  They then swam
20m to a shotline and began their descent.  They descended
the line one behind the other, with the diver who had waited in
the water last.  They checked each other twice during the
descent.  The first two divers arrived at the bottom of the
shotline at a depth of 50m.  They changed the settings of their
rebreathers and one attached a strobe to the shotline.  They
looked up for the third diver but he was not there.  They
checked around and they made an ascent to the surface.  The
missing diver was not at the surface.  They raised the alarm and
one of the divers re-descended to search for the missing diver.
He found the missing diver on the bottom.  His rebreather hand
sets were found to be part way through the set up sequence.
The casualty had his mouth piece in place and the rescuing
diver completed the rebreather set up sequence and then
brought the casualty to the surface.  Both divers then towed the
casualty to a pontoon and others helped to recover him from the
water.  Resuscitation techniques were applied but the casualty
failed to recover.  Because of his rapid ascent, the rescuing
diver was placed on oxygen and then flown by helicopter to a
recompression facility.  He developed symptoms of DCI and
received a three day series of treatments.  A post mortem
examination concluded that the casualty died from asphyxia.
The Coroner's inquest concluded that he had failed to switch on
the rebreather controls before his dive.
July 2004 04/223
A diver completed a dive and then undertook a second to a
depth of 30m.  He surfaced at the end of the second dive and
was seen to be in need of assistance.  Before the boat could
approach him he sank from view.  The Coastguard was alerted
and a search involving two lifeboats, a helicopter and other
vessels was initiated.  An hour later the diver's body was found
by a fishing vessel.  He was taken by helicopter to hospital but
found to be dead on arrival.

July 2004 04/232
A pair of divers conducted a dive to a depth of 23m.  One of the
pair noticed the other ascend.  He waited a short while and then
deployed a delayed SMB and made his ascent.  At the surface
he asked if the other diver had surfaced, but he had not been
seen.  Another pair of divers came across the missing diver
lying on the seabed.  He had no hood or mask and his regulator
was not in his mouth.  The divers inflated the casualty's BCD
and sent him to the surface and the diver was recovered into
the boat.  The emergency services were alerted.  It was noted
that his weightbelt was round his legs caught on his knife strap
and that his pony cylinder was empty and his main cylinder was
full.  A lifeboat was tasked to assist.  The diver was taken by
ambulance to hospital but failed to recover.
July 2004 04/233
Two divers surfaced rapidly after a wreck dive.  The Coastguard
was alerted and the divers were brought ashore.  On land one
of the divers was declared dead and the other was airlifted to a
recompression facility for treatment.  (Media report).
July 2004 04/236
Three divers conducted a dive to a wreck in a maximum depth
of 40m.  All three were using nitrox 26 as a dive gas and nitrox
50 for decompression.  When one of the three reached 100 bar
they started to make their way back to the shotline.  One of the
three then started to deploy her delayed SMB and the other two
stopped to launch their own SMBs.  They started their ascent
within sight of each other.  The SMB lines of two of the divers
became tangled and they had to concentrate on correcting this.
When they looked back the third diver was not to be seen.  One
of the two re-descended but could not see the missing diver.
Both divers carried out their decompression stops and surfaced.
Whilst they were doing so the missing diver was seen to arrive
at the surface with her BCD inflated.  It was quickly noticed that
she was face down and not moving.  She was recovered into
the boat and resuscitation techniques were applied.  A lifeboat
attended with a doctor onboard but the diver failed to recover.
Subsequent examination found that the casualty's
decompression gas was 53% oxygen.  Her dive computer
showed that she made a normal ascent to 23m, then a gradual
descent to 30m then a rapid ascent to the surface in less than 1
min.  It is thought that the casualty switched to her
decompression gas before sinking back down to 30m.  Her
SMB was not found and she may have experienced problems
with it or with her buoyancy control.  It was thought that
breathing 53% oxygen at 30m may have induced oxygen
toxicity resulting in her inflating her BCD to raise her quickly to
the surface.
July 2004 04/255
The Coastguard was alerted when a diver surfaced
unconscious from a maximum depth of 8m.  The diver was
recovered into the boat and resuscitation techniques were
applied.  The casualty was airlifted to hospital but he was
declared dead shortly afterwards.  Cause of death was not
thought to be diving related.   (Coastguard report).
July 2004 04/264
Shortly after surfacing from a dive, a diver complained of chest
pains.  His condition quickly deteriorated and the Coastguard
was alerted.  Resuscitation techniques were applied to the
casualty and he was airlifted to hospital.  Shortly after his arrival
he died.  It is thought that he had suffered a heart attack.
August 2004 04/256
A diver entered the water for his second dive of the day.  He
was using a rebreather.  In the water he appeared to be very
negatively buoyant and he called for assistance.  His buddy
offered his alternative air source but the troubled diver did not
take it.  The buddy had his mask knocked off and his regulator
knocked from his mouth.  The troubled diver sank quickly.
There was a 2 knot current.  The buddy refitted his equipment
and dived down to try to locate the missing diver.  He was not
successful.  The Coastguard was alerted and an unsuccessful
air and sea search was conducted.  His body was found,
washed ashore, twelve days later.
August 2004 04/265
A diver experienced equipment difficulties whilst diving on a
wreck in a depth of 25m.  He was found to be unconscious at
the surface.  He was recovered into the boat and resuscitation
techniques were applied.  The Coastguard was alerted and the
casualty was brought ashore by lifeboat.  He was declared dead
on arrival at the shore.  It was reported that the casualty had
suffered a pulmonary barotrauma.
September 2004 04/336
Three divers were conducting a night dive to a depth of 15m.
Two of them surfaced and then one of them shouted for help
and sank.  His body was later recovered from underwater.

Decompression Incidents
October 2003 04/060
A diver conducted a dive to 33m.  During the dive water entered
his drysuit and he decided to abort the dive.  His dive duration
was 25 min.  Once out of the water he complained of feeling
cold and unwell.  He stated that his legs felt 'tingly'.  He was
given water to drink and placed on oxygen.  The Coastguard
was alerted and the diver was evacuated to a recompression
facility where he received treatment.  He was released the
following day.  This diver was participating in a dive holiday and
had dived previously to the subject dive.
October 2003 04/392
Diver reported having sore shoulder a skin rash, suspected of
having DCI.  Taken to recompression chamber for treatment
lasting 6 hours.  (Coastguard report).
November 2003 04/394
Dive support vessel contacted Coastguard asking for
assistance having a diver aboard suffering from suspected DCI.
Casualty was airlifted to chamber, buddy also taken as a
precaution.  (Coastguard report).
November 2003 04/026
Two divers dived to 35m.  During their ascent, at a depth of
17m, one of the pair lost control of his buoyancy and made a
rapid ascent to the surface.  His total dive time was 16 min.  He
was placed on oxygen.  45 min after surfacing he noticed a pain
in the calf of his right leg.  He was taken by ambulance to
hospital and from there to a recompression facility where he
received treatment.  The diver's drysuit had a cuff dump valve
and he stated that this had not worked correctly.
November 2003 04/045
A diver completed a 32 min dive to a depth of 15m.  4 hours 50
min later the diver developed a headache and began to vomit,
his recollection of the day's events was also confused.  Medical
advice was sought and the diver was taken to hospital and
placed on oxygen.  From hospital he was taken to a
recompression chamber for treatment.  He was kept in hospital
for observation for 24 hours and then discharged.
November 2003 04/032
Two divers suffering from DCI were transferred to a lifeboat and
then airlifted to a recompression chamber for treatment.  It is
believed that one of the divers suffered equipment problems
which caused them to make a rapid ascent.   (Media report).
November 2003 04/396
Diver self referred to recompression chamber, treated twice as
first was unsuccessful in resolving symptoms.  Diver was using
a rebreather.  (Coastguard report).
November 2003 04/397
Dive support vessel called Coastguard reporting having a diver
aboard suffering from type 1 DCI.  Immediately rescue
helicopter R-193 was scrambled and recovered the diver from
the scene, assisted by the Coastguard rescue team.
Administered oxygen on scene for 15-20 min before being
recovered to recompression chamber for treatment.  Diver was
diagnosed as having "severe spinal bend" from an apparently
normal dive.  (Coastguard report).
December 2003 04/039
A diver conducted a series of three dives.  24m for 40 min with
a 3 min stop at 6m.  After a 1 hour 54 min surface interval he
dived to 21m for 40 min with a 3 min stop at 6m.  Finally, after a
surface interval of 1 hour 10 min he dived to 20m for 43 min
with a 6 min ascent to 6m and a 3 min stop at 6m.  When he
arrived back at his home that evening he noticed a rash on his
chest and a pain in his right shoulder.  He sought diving medical
advice and was referred to a recompression chamber.  He was
placed on oxygen for the journey to the recompression chamber
and once there he received two sessions of recompression
therapy.  He was discharged the following day symptom-free.
December 2003 04/047
A diver completed a dive to 27m for 48 min with a 3 min stop at
6m.  2 hours 57 min later he made a second dive.  The
anticipated depth of the second dive was 12m to the deck of a
wreck on a seabed at 18m.  When the divers descended they
discovered the deck at 19m and the seabed at 28m and sloping
steeply downwards.  The subject diver's second dive was to
33m for 43 min with a 3 min stop at 6m.  Shortly after getting
out of the water the diver felt that he had a migraine attack
beginning and he went to lie down.  30 min later he felt dizzy,
disorientated and sick.  He was placed on oxygen and the
Coastguard was alerted.  The diver was taken by lifeboat to a
recompression facility where he received six sessions of
recompression therapy over the next 4 days.  The diagnosis
was of a vesticular DCI in his ear.  He was advised not to dive
again.  The report states that the dive computer profiles did not
violate the computer limits but that according to dive tables the
second dive was not viable.
December 2003 04/066
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 22m.  One
of the pair was slightly too buoyant and placed rocks in his BCD
pockets to compensate.  After about 30 min the buckle on the
other diver’s weightbelt came undone.  She grabbed hold of the
belt but one of the two weights fell off.  The diver with rocks in
his BCD took hold of her and helped her to swim back down to
the lost weight.  He tried to refit her weightbelt but the buckle
had come off completely.  At this point he ran low on air and
switched to his second cylinder.  The regulator let in some
water and his mask came loose.  The diver who had lost the
weightbelt placed the weights in the pockets of her BCD and
they began to ascend.  At 12m their ascent rate increased and
they made an uncontrolled ascent to the surface, missing a
planned stop.  Their dive duration was 34 min.  One computer
indicated a missed stop; the other did not.  6 hours later the
diver who had been buoyant at the start of the dive suddenly felt
sick and dizzy, he also noticed that his fingers were tingling.  He
went to hospital.  He was placed on oxygen and taken by
ambulance to a recompression facility where he received
treatment.  He was discharged the following day.  His buddy did
not experience any symptoms.
December 2003 04/044
Two divers started their ascent from 43m.  At 20m they
deployed a delayed SMB.  Whilst doing so they sank back to
43m.  They became short of air and surfaced missing
decompression stops.  One of the pair experienced 'pins and
needles' in his legs and both were airlifted to a recompression
chamber where they both received recompression treatment.
January 2004 04/069
A diver completed a dive to a maximum depth of 28m.  After 29

NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2004  
©BSAC -2004 9
min he ascended to 6m where he conducted a 6 min stop.  5
min after surfacing he developed a pain in his neck, had a loss
of peripheral vision and his legs felt weak.  He was placed on
nitrox for 5 min and then oxygen for 10 min.  His symptoms
resolved.  He sought medical advice and it was suggested that
he should go home and make further contact if symptoms
reoccurred.  Later that day, his legs felt weak again and he had
difficulty urinating.  He went to a recompression chamber and
received a series of treatments over a three day period.  He
was left with a residual neck pain and reduced feeling in his
right leg.
January 2004 04/401
Dive support vessel called Coastguard reporting having a diver
aboard with suspected DCI following a rapid ascent, believed
equipment failure, airlifted to recompression chamber for
treatment.  (Coastguard report).
January 2004 04/080
Three divers conducted a dive to a depth of 20m.  One of the
three began to panic and made a rapid ascent to the surface.
She was found to have a skin rash and pains in her knee joints.
She was placed on oxygen and then airlifted to a
recompression chamber for treatment where she made a
complete recovery.
February 2004 04/084
A group of six students, two instructors, one dive marshal and
an observer undertook a dive to 20m.  At this depth one of the
students started to panic and one of the instructors went to
help.  At this time the observer had a problem and made a rapid
ascent to the surface, the last 10m of which may have been
without a regulator in his mouth.  This diver was placed on
oxygen and then taken to hospital for examination for a
potential DCI.
February 2004 04/407
Following a request from ambulance control, diver airlifted to
recompression chamber for treatment after being admitted to
hospital, Coastguard teams manned the helicopter landing site.
(Coastguard report).
February 2004 04/108
Diver with suspected DCI, airlifted to recompression chamber
for treatment by Coastguard.  (Coastguard report).
March 2004 04/408
Brixham Coastguard tasked Plymouth Coastguard to
investigate the report of a diver with suspected DCI, diver
recovered to hospital by ambulance.  (Coastguard report).
March 2004 04/111
A diver diving at a depth of 15m became disorientated and
dropped to 23m.  He then made a rapid ascent to the surface.
The Coastguard was alerted and he was taken by ambulance to
a recompression facility for treatment.  (Media report).
March 2004 04/120
A diver conducted a dive to 30m for 43 min including a 3 min
stop at 6m and a 6 min stop at 3m.  3 hours 13 min later he
dived to 33 m for 15 min including a 4 min stop at 3m.  The
following day, 19 hours 19 min later he dived to 30m for 54 min
including a 15 min stop at 5m.  His final dive was 2 hours 48
min later to a depth of 28m for 39 min including a 3 min stop at
6m.  10 min after this last dive he noted a muscle pain in his
shoulder; he thought that this was due to his heavy diving
equipment.  2 hours later the pain got worse and grew to
include both shoulders.  He was placed on oxygen.  5 hours
later he noticed a rash on his left side.  The shoulder pain had
reduced to just one shoulder.  The rash had gone by the
following morning and the shoulder pain went after a further four
days.  He was advised by a diving doctor that he had had a mild
DCI.
March 2004 04/116
A diver was airlifted to a recompression chamber for treatment
after reporting that he felt unwell after a dive.
March 2004 04/412
Diver complained of tightness and coughing on breathing and
coldness following two dives, casualty airlifted to recompression
chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard report).
March 2004 04/411
Portland Coastguard tasked Coastguard rescue helicopter R-IJ
to recover a diver suffering from suspected DCI and transport to
chamber for treatment.  Poole Coastguard tasked to assist at
the helo landing site.  (Coastguard and RNLI reports).
April 2004 04/166
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 28m.  The
dive leader was using a rebreather.  The other diver, who had
an open circuit set, was observed to be using air at an elevated
rate.  When he reached 100 bar they decided to return to the
shotline to ascend.  They were not able to find the shotline so,
as planned, they started to deploy delayed SMBs.  The dive
leader deployed his SMB but the other diver had some difficulty
with his reel.  The dive leader assisted him and noted that he
only had 50 bar remaining.  They started their ascent.  At 18m
the dive leader felt a tug on his SMB line and this started a
buoyant ascent which he was not able to control.  He was
carried to the surface and his buddy went with him.  He believes
that the rebreather injected oxygen during the ascent thus
adding to his buoyancy control problems.  His total dive time
was 24 min and he ascended from 16m to the surface in 1 min.
Climbing the ladder to get into the boat the dive leader felt
weak.  He reported their fast ascent and they were placed on
oxygen.  He noted a tingling in the big toe of his left foot and a
rash on his chest.  The Coastguard was alerted and once
ashore the diver was taken by ambulance to a recompression
facility where he was treated for DCI.  It was recommended that
he be tested for a PFO.
April 2004 04/365
A pair of divers entered the water from an RHIB.  They were
down current of the shot buoy and had to swim hard to get to it.
They started their descent and one of the pair felt
uncomfortable as they went down the shotline.  Once on the
wreck he realised that he had forgotten to put his ankle weights
on.  When they made their ascent this diver started to have
buoyancy control problems.  At 19m he felt very light.  His
buddy attempted to control the ascent but at 15m they lost
control completely and the buoyant diver rose rapidly to the
surface, missing decompression stops.  His buddy ascended at
a normal rate.  The buoyant diver was recovered into the boat
and placed on oxygen.  He reported having a pain in his left
biceps.  The Coastguard was alerted and the diver and his
buddy were airlifted to a recompression facility.  The buoyant
diver was given recompression treatment.
April 2004 04/190
A diver dived to a maximum depth of 44m for a total dive time of
36 min.  At the end of his dive he took 9 min to ascend from

NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2004
10 ©BSAC - 2004
15m to the surface.  1 hour 26 min later he dived to 31m for a
total dive time of 39 min including a 3 min stop at 5m and a 1
min stop at 3m.  1 hour later he started to feel dizzy and he
developed tunnel vision.  He was taken to a recompression
facility and received six sessions of treatment over a five day
period for a vascular DCI.
April 2004 04/169
An instructor and a trainee conducted a drift dive to a maximum
depth of 11m.  After 28 min the instructor signalled the ascent.
The trainee was slightly above the instructor and she started to
make a rapid ascent.  The instructor took hold of her to slow her
ascent.  The trainee panicked and fully inflated her BCD.  Both
divers were carried to the surface at a fast rate.  2 hours after
the dive, the instructor felt a slight pain in his knee.  He reported
to a recompression facility and received two treatments for DCI
over a 2 day period.
April 2004 04/138
Two divers completed a 41 min dive to 36m with a 2 min safety
stop at 3m.    Shortly after leaving the water one of the pair felt
dizzy and was sick.  He was placed on oxygen and then taken
by ambulance to hospital.  From hospital he was taken to a
recompression facility for treatment.
April 2004 04/366
A diver completed a dive to a maximum depth of 14m.  He
experienced problems with his buoyancy control and he made
multiple rapid ascents to 6m.  At one point he ascended from
10m to the surface.  His dive duration was 37 min.  The
following morning he noticed that his upper left arm was sore.
Later that day his arm began to go numb, it felt alternately hot
and cold and he had a tingling in the fingers of his left hand.  He
sought diving medical advice and went to a recompression
facility the following day where he was treated for a spinal DCI.
April 2004 04/417
Diver complained of feeling unwell sickness and 'pins &
needles' following a rapid ascent.  Condition improved shortly
after surfacing.  (Coastguard report).
April 2004 04/415
Dive support vessel contacted Coastguard reporting having a
diver aboard reporting symptoms of DCI.  Coastguard helicopter
scrambled, casualty airlifted to recompression chamber for
treatment, Coastguard rescue team attending.  (Coastguard
report).
April 2004 04/146
Two divers surfaced too quickly after a dive and were airlifted to
a recompression facility where they received treatment.  (Media
report).
April 2004 04/354
A diver conducted a dive to 26m for 30 min with a 2 min stop at
6m.  16 hours later he dived to 28m for 28 min with a 2 min stop
at 6m.  4 hours later he dived to 30m for 30 min with a 2 min
stop at 6m.  During this last dive he dived 2m deeper for 3 min
longer than he planned.   Later he developed DCI and was
given recompression treatment.  He had had a DCI three years
earlier.
April 2004 04/416
Dive support vessel reported having two divers aboard suffering
from suspected DCI following a dive to 26m.  Missing a
decompression stop on ascent, airlifted to recompression
chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard report).
April 2004 04/149
A trainee diver was on his second open water dive.  He entered
the water from a jetty with an instructor.  They descended to 4m
and conducted a buoyancy control check.  They then surfaced,
collected an SMB and started their dive.  They dived to a
maximum depth of 9m and, after 32 min they made an
unplanned ascent to the surface because the trainee lost
control of his buoyancy.  They re-descended and continued the
dive.  At 6m they conducted mask and regulator clearing drills.
They then made a faster than normal ascent to the surface.
Their dive time was 47 min.  Later that day, back home, the
trainee experienced a tingling and pain in his arm.  He
contacted a recompression facility and then attended the facility
for recompression treatment for DCI.
April 2004 04/151
Two divers completed a 32 min dive to a maximum depth of
32m with a 9 min stop at 6m.  During the dive they ascended
from 32m to 6m and then went back down to 26m.  One of the
pair stated that he experienced nitrogen narcosis during the
dive and, an hour after surfacing, he began to feel unwell.  He
was placed on oxygen and the emergency services were
alerted.  His condition continued to deteriorate and he lost
coordination and sight.  He was airlifted to a recompression
facility where he received two sessions of treatment for a
cerebral embolism.  Prior to the dive the casualty suffered from
a lack of sleep, dehydration and a headache for which he had
taken painkillers 2 hours before the dive.

A diver surfaced from a wreck dive and developed symptoms of
DCI.  She was brought ashore and then taken by ambulance to
a recompression facility for treatment.  (Media report).
May 2004 04/321
A pair of divers conducted a dive to 39m for 60 min including a
14 min stop at 3m.  4 hours 30 min later they dived to 34m.
During the ascent from this dive, at a depth of 6m one of the
pair moved from a horizontal to a vertical position.  He then lost
control of his buoyancy and was carried to the surface.  His
buddy could see that he was safe at the surface so he
completed the required stops.  The diver who had made the
buoyant ascent was recovered into the boat and placed on
oxygen.  He reported a tingling sensation in his right forearm.
The Coastguard was alerted and the divers returned to shore
where they were met by an ambulance.  The diver and his
buddy were taken to a recompression facility.  The diver who
had made the buoyant ascent was treated; his buddy was not.
The diver had been wearing a new, thick, undersuit and his
drysuit had a small, shoulder-mounted dump valve.  It is thought
that as he moved into a vertical orientation the shoulder straps
of his BCD restricted the air flow inside the suit and thus he was
not able to vent sufficient air.  He was using a heavy, twin
cylinder set.
May 2004 04/430
Dive support vessel contacted Coastguard reporting having a
diver aboard suffering from suspected DCI, following a Medi link
call to diving doctor the diver was met by ambulance and
transferred to recompression facility for treatment.  Symptoms
skin rash on torso, migraine and tingling in eye.  (Coastguard
report).

rescue helicopter.  (Coastguard report).
May 2004 04/205
Three divers completed a 30 min dive to 33m including a 1 min
stop at 6m.  Once out of the water one of the divers became ill
and was unsteady on his feet.  He was placed on oxygen and
after 20 min he had recovered.  He put his illness down to being
rushed before the dive and declined the offers of further
assistance or medical advice.  Later the diver was taken to a
recompression facility where he was treated for a spinal DCI
and bladder problems.
May 2004 04/183
A diver conducted a 40 min dive to 21m with a 4 min stop at
6m.  1 hour 40 min later he dived to 12m for 23 min with a 3 min
stop at 6m.  During the journey home he felt a minor itching.
Later that evening he experienced 'pins and needles' and
further itching.  An hour later he developed a chest pain, light-
headedness, dizziness, 'pins and needles' and a pain in his
back.  He sought medical advice by phone and was advised to
attend a recompression facility.  He received two sessions of
recompression therapy.  Dehydration was thought to have been
a contributing factor.
May 2004 04/438
MRSC Humber received a call on VHF channel 16 from a dive
support vessel reporting having a diver feeling unwell following
a dive to 32m.  A medi link call was established and upon
medical advice casualty was airlifted to recompression chamber
for treatment, RAF helicopter recovering casualty Coastguard
team manning the landing site.  (Coastguard report).
May 2004 04/177
A diver conducted a 30 min dive to a wreck at a depth of 50m.
During his ascent he switched breathing gases.  His buddy then
saw him convulse and spit out his regulator.  He then made a
free ascent to the surface missing 40 min of decompression.
He was unconscious at the surface.  He was recovered into a
dive boat and placed on oxygen.  The Coastguard was alerted
and a helicopter, which was on route to another incident
(04/176 refers), was diverted to airlift him to hospital.  The diver
quickly recovered consciousness and was subsequently treated
for a 'skin bend'.
May 2004 04/367
A diver dived solo to a maximum depth of 55m using trimix
16/40.  During his ascent he stopped for 2 min at 40m, 2 min at
30m, 1 min at 23m, 8 min at 9m and 25 min at 6m.  The stop at
6m was conducted using nitrox 80.  During this stop he
experienced a severe burning sensation on breathing.  Then he
felt a 'wave of heat' in his legs and some numbness in his feet.
He finished his decompression and the symptoms resolved.
Later that evening he had difficulty walking and urinating and he
had a pain in his lower back.  He received recompression
treatment and had a brief spell in hospital.
May 2004 04/299
A diver conducted a dive to a depth of 25m.  He lost control of
his ascent at 18m, recovered, then lost it again at 13m and
made an uncontrolled ascent to the surface.  His buddy made a
normal ascent with a 2 min safety stop at 6m.  The diver who
had made the uncontrolled ascent was recovered into the boat.
He complained of 'pins and needles' in his right hand and was
placed on oxygen.  His dive time was 30 min.  He was pale and
nauseous. The Coastguard was alerted and the diver and his
buddy were airlifted to a recompression facility.  The diver was
successfully recompressed; the buddy required no treatment.
This diver had had a DCI a year earlier.
May 2004 04/176
Two divers surfaced, missing decompression stops, after a dive
to 28m.  The Coastguard was alerted and a helicopter was
tasked to airlift them to a recompression facility.  On route, the
helicopter was diverted to another incident (04/177 refers) so a
lifeboat was tasked with bringing the divers ashore.  The
helicopter then returned and airlifted the divers from the shore
to a recompression facility for treatment.  (Coastguard and RNLI
reports).
May 2004 04/540
The Coastguard received a call from a dive boat with two divers
suffering from DCI.  The divers were airlifted to a recompression
facility for treatment.  (Coastguard report).

A diver using a rebreather with trimix, dived to 20m for a total
duration of 6 min.  18 min later he dived to 35m for 31 min
including a 2 min stop at 12m and a 2 min stop at 6m.  The
following day he dived to 22m for 66 min including a 13 min
stop at 4m.  The day after that he dived to 31m for 29 min
including a 2 min stop at 7m.  He felt unwell after the last dive
but he put this down to a hangover.  The next day he still felt
sick and he then noticed a slight tingling in his face and left arm.
He thought that this was due to sunburn.  The following day his
condition worsened slightly and he suffered from slight visual
disturbances.  He contacted a recompression facility and
received a series of nine recompression treatments for DCI.  He
was left with residual symptoms that were expected to slowly
resolve.  Dehydration and tiredness were thought to be
contributory factors.
May 2004 04/245
A diver conducted six dives over a three day period.  On the
first day he dived to 31m for 35 min with a 3 min stop at 6m,
and to 20m for 47 min with a 3 min stop at 6m.  On the second
day he dived to 30m for 59 min with a 16 min stop at 6m, and to
16m for 30 min with a 3 min stop at 6m. On the final day he
dived to 31m for 36 min with a 2 min stop at 6m, and to 21m for
29 min with a 2 min stop at 6m. He had a surface interval of 90
min between these last two dives.  About 1 hour after his last
dive he started to feel unwell and he developed a rash on his
shoulder.  He was placed on oxygen and advice was sought by
phone.  He was taken to a recompression facility where he was
given a 5 hour treatment and a further 1 hour 30 min treatment
the following day.
May 2004 04/226
A diver conducted a dive to 19m for 33 min with a 3 min stop at
6m.  The following day, 20 hours later, she dived to 18m.
During the dive her buddy indicated that she was out of air and
she donated her alternative air source.  She then found that her
buddy's cylinder valve was not turned on properly.  She turned
the valve on and the buddy switched back to her own regulator.
They decided to terminate the dive and made their way to the
shotline.  They struggled to conduct a 3 min stop at 6m due to
wave action.  They surfaced after 25 min and the boat returned
to the shore.  Once ashore they removed their diving kit from
the boat which involved significant effort.  A little later the diver
noticed that her vision was impaired and she felt dizzy and light-
headed.  She drank some water and sought advice from other
members of her party.  She was placed on oxygen and the
Coastguard was alerted.  The diver was taken by ambulance to
a recompression facility where she was treated over a period of
several days for a DCI sited in her cerebellum.  Subsequent
tests revealed that this diver has a PFO.  She reported that she
had started her period on the day of the subject dive.
June 2004 04/194
A diver dived to a maximum depth of 37m for 79 min, including
a 2 min stop at 9m and a 40 min stop at 6m.  30 min after
surfacing his left arm started to ache and it became painful after
2 hours.  The next day it felt the same and he sought medical
advice.  He went to a recompression facility where he received
two sessions of recompression therapy for DCI.
June 2004 04/187
A diver suffering from DCI was taken by ambulance to a
recompression facility for treatment.  (Media report).
June 2004 04/227
A diver completed a dive to 30m for a duration of 72 min
including a 2 min stop at 17m, a 2 min stop at 15m and a 25
min stop at 3m.  After a surface interval of 2 hours 4 min he
dived again.  The second dive was to 20m for 41 min including
a 3 min stop at 6m.  After removing his kit from the boat he
noticed a pain in his left shoulder.  Initially he put this down to a
muscular strain.  Nine months earlier he had had a suspected
DCI diagnosed as a strain.  The following morning the
symptoms remained and he sought medical advice.  He
received two sessions of recompression therapy over a two day
period.  The symptoms remained but medical opinion was that
he had had a DCI.  Physical exertion before and after the dive
was believed to have contributed.
June 2004 04/191
A diver completed a 46 min dive to a maximum depth of 24m
with a 3 min stop at 6m.  During the dive he was slightly over-
weighted and had to fin harder than normal.  The majority of the
dive was spent at 15m and, at the end of the dive, his computer
indicated 30 min of no-stop time remaining.  At the surface the
diver developed a headache and began to feel nauseous.  10
min later he appeared very pale and his headache was severe.
He was placed on oxygen.  20 min later he noticed a numbness
in his right hand.  Medical advice was sought by phone and the
Coastguard was notified.  He was taken by helicopter to a
recompression facility where he was treated for a neurological
DCI.  He was discharged the following day, symptom-free.
June 2004 04/355
A diver completed a 76 min dive to 51m including the following
stops; 2 min at 24m, 3 min at 21m, 2 min at 19m, 2 min at 15m,
4 min at 12m, 5 min at 9m, 20 min at 6m and then 5 min to the
surface.  17 hours 26 min later he dived again to 51m for 75 min
including the following stops;  2 min at 24m, 3 min at 21m, 2
min at 18m, 2 min at 15m, 4 min at 12m, 5 min at 9m, 24 min at
6m and then 5 min to the surface.  After this dive he felt a
tingling sensation in the two middle fingers of his right hand.  He
removed his drysuit and the feeling disappeared.  1 hour 45 min
after the dive he experienced brief periods of blurred vision.  4
hours later he noticed a pain in a finger of his right hand.  He
also developed a pain in his right shoulder.  He sought diving
medical advice and went to a recompression facility where he
was treated for DCI.  He received two further recompression
treatments and was left with a numbness in two middle fingers.
June 2004 04/547
A diver conducted a series of ten dives over a five day period.
The tenth dive took place after a 4 hour surface interval.  This
dive was to a maximum depth of 27m.  She lost control of her
buoyancy during the ascent at a depth of between 15 and 10m.
She attempted to fin back down but the air migrated in her
drysuit and she was carried, inverted, to the surface.  She
quickly re-descended to join her buddy and they ascended
together.  Shortly afterwards the diver noted a pain in her right
shoulder.  This was thought to be a muscular strain.  Later that
day the symptoms resolved.  The following day the symptoms
returned and she sought medical advice.  She was
recompressed and the symptoms resolved.
June 2004 04/446
Dive support vessel contacted Solent Coastguard reporting
having a diver aboard suffering from suspected DCI.  A medi
link was established, doctor recommended evacuation.  Solent

June 2004 04/213
Two divers conducted a 34 min dive to 25m including a 4 min
stop at 6m.  1 hour 39 min later they made a second dive.
During the descent the dive leader noticed that the other diver
was slow to descend and was having problems with his ears
and with dumping air from his BCD.  They reached a maximum
depth of 24m and then moved up to 20m.  The other diver
signalled that he had a problem with his weightbelt and the dive
leader helped him refit it correctly.  Towards the end of the dive
they prepared to deploy a delayed SMB but had to move when
they spotted a large lion's mane jellyfish directly above them.
The dive leader deployed the SMB and then lost control of his
buoyancy at 12m and was carried rapidly to the surface.  His
dive duration was 27m.  The other diver followed making a
normal ascent.  At the surface the dive leader had a severe
headache.  The divers were recovered from the water.  The dive
leader was dizzy and disorientated; he was placed on oxygen
and the emergency services were alerted.  They returned to
harbour and were transported by the RNLI and helicopter to a
recompression chamber.  The dive leader was recompressed
and released the following day.  The other diver was released
without recompression treatment.
June 2004 04/356
A diver conducted a 57 min dive to 36m including a 25 min stop
at 6m.  2 hours 3 min later he dived to 27m for 40 min including
a 7 min stop at 5m.  18 hours 13 min later he dived to 32m for
60 min with a 1 min stop at 15m and a 20 min stop at 4m.  He
used nitrox 40 for decompression.  During this dive he became
separated from his buddy during the descent because a current
swept him away from the shotline.  He surfaced, was towed by
the boat back to the shotline, and he re-descended to join his
buddy who was waiting at the bottom of the shotline.  After this
dive he noticed a 'twinge' in his shoulder but thought that it was
a muscular strain.  After a surface interval of 2 hours 20 min he
dived to 22m for 26 min including a 2 min stop at 4m.  After this
dive he again noticed the pain in his shoulder.  1 hour later the
pain had increased and he was placed on oxygen for 5 min.  A
few hours later the pain had become severe and he sought
advice from a recompression facility.  He received
recompression treatment.

including a 2 min stop at 6m.  About 45 min after the dive he
started to feel dizzy.  He was placed on oxygen and taken to
hospital.  At hospital he was found to be disorientated and he
developed short term amnesia.  He was airlifted to a
recompression facility for treatment.  He was found to have a
right inner ear barotrauma and a probable arterial gas embolism
was diagnosed.
July 2004 04/337
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 40m.
During the ascent, at a depth of 7m, one of the pair ran out of
air and made a rapid ascent to the surface missing
decompression stops.  His dive duration was 25 min.  He was
unconscious on arrival at the surface.  Another diver entered
the water to assist and the casualty and his buddy were
recovered into the boat.  The casualty was not breathing.
Oxygen-assisted AV was applied and the casualty started to
breathe by himself and then to regain consciousness.  The
Coastguard was alerted.  The casualty was transferred into a
lifeboat and then he and his buddy were airlifted to a
recompression facility.

A diver completed a 75 min dive to a maximum depth of 6m.  2
hours 42 min later he dived again to 6m for 31 min.  After this
second dive he felt unwell, sick, and he had slight ‘pins and
needles’ in his hands and feet.  He was placed on oxygen for 20
min and he felt better.  When taken off the oxygen he started to
feel unwell again.  He was taken by ambulance to hospital
where he was placed on oxygen for 4 hours and given a fluid
drip.  He was discharged from hospital later that day.  Tiredness
and lack of fluids and food were thought to have been
contributory factors.

July 2004 04/289
A diver completed a series of twelve dives over a six day
period.  All dives were conducted on nitrox 30 and limited to a
maximum depth of 36m.  The following morning, 15 hours after
his last dive, the diver awoke with a strange sensation in the
little finger of his left hand.  He contacted the Coastguard and
was referred to a recompression facility where he received
treatment which resolved his symptoms.
July 2004 04/372
A diver conducted a dive to 34m for 39 min including a 12 min
stop at 6m.  6 hours 45 min later she dived to 29m for 22 min
with a 3 min safety stop at 6m.  She was recovered into the
boat and then she felt a sudden pain in her back.  She was
placed on nitrox 65.  She then noticed a tingling in her thigh.
The boat's radio seemed faulty and they could not contact the
Coastguard.  They returned to shore and contacted the
Coastguard by phone.  The diver was taken by helicopter to a
recompression facility for treatment.  It was later discovered that
this diver had a PFO and was awaiting corrective surgery.
July 2004 04/303
A diver conducted a dive to 30m for 33 min including a 3 min
stop at 5m and a 1 min stop at 3m.  Shortly after the dive he
developed a pain in his back which he initially thought was due
to a muscle strain.  He lay down in the boat.  He then developed
'pins and needles' in his stomach.  He was placed on oxygen
and the Coastguard was alerted.  The boat was instructed to
rendezvous with a lifeboat, but sea conditions slowed their
progress.  The casualty became violently sick.  A helicopter was
tasked to recover the diver who was airlifted, with his buddy, to
a recompression facility.  The diver received a series of
recompression treatments over a period of seven days.  He was
left with total deafness in his right ear and disturbed balance.
He was advised not to dive again.
July 2004 04/250
The Coastguard was alerted when a diver complained of loss of
feeling in her legs and difficulty breathing.  She was airlifted to a
recompression facility for treatment.  (Media report).
July 2004 04/294
A diver made a 45 min dive to 22m with a 2 min stop at 6m.  18
hours later he dived to 30m for 34 min with a 4 min stop at 6m.
Once back on the boat he felt an ache across his chest.  This
symptom slowly got worse.  After removing his dive suit he felt
slightly unsteady on his feet.  He sat down and started to feel
very unwell.  When he tried to stand he found that he was
unable to use his legs and he was laid down and placed on
oxygen.  The Coastguard was alerted and the diver was airlifted
to a recompression facility.  He received an 8 hour
recompression treatment followed by a 6 hour treatment on the
following three days.  At the end of this treatment he had
partially regained the use of his legs.  For the next four weeks
he received a 2 hour treatment twice a day each day.  At the
end of this time he was able to walk but not run.  It was
anticipated that full recovery would take a further two years.
July 2004 04/301
A diver completed a 71 min dive to 34m including a 1 min stop
at each of 15m, 12m and 9m and an 18 min stop at 6m.  21
hours later he dived to 34m for 72 min with a 1 min stop at each
of 15m, 12m and 9m and a 24 min stop at 6m.  He was using
nitrox 32 for both dives.  Later that night he felt tired and had
lost his appetite.  The next morning he still felt unwell; he was
light-headed and had memory loss.  He sought diving medical
advice and went to a recompression facility.  He received a 6
hour treatment which resolved his symptoms.
July 2004 04/262
A diver conducted a dive to 59m using 18/45 trimix.  His dive
duration was a total of 84m.  His decompression stops involved
the use of 100% oxygen.  24 hours later he dived, with two
others, to a depth of 61m.  All three divers used 18/45 trimix.
After 25 min they deployed a delayed SMB and started their
ascent.  They made a 1 min stop at each of 36m, 33m, 30m and
27m and a 3 min stop at 24m.  They then switched to nitrox 50
and made a 5 min stop at 21m , 3 min stops at each of 18m,
15m and 12m and a 6 min stop at 9m.  Their final stop was for
20 min at 6m on 100% oxygen.  10 min after having re-boarded
the boat one of the three noticed a dead feeling in his left
shoulder and down to his elbow.  He was placed on oxygen and
given water to drink.  The boat returned to the shore and the
diver was taken to a recompression facility.  No DCI was found
but, because his arm symptoms had improved with oxygen, he
was given a precautionary recompression treatment.  The diver
had suffered a DCI incident two years earlier.  It was
subsequently found that his dive gas actually contained 16.6%
oxygen.  It was thought that dehydration may have been a
contributory factor.
July 2004 04/244
A diver completed a dive to a maximum depth of 36m.  His dive
time was 58 min including a 1 min stop at 15m, a 1 min stop at
12m, a 2 min stop at 9m and a 6 min stop at 6m.  He was using
nitrox 28.  About 70 min after the dive he noticed a rash on his
right shoulder and shoulder blade.  The skin was tender in this
area.  15 min later the rash had spread, become deeper in
colour and his skin texture had a 'bubbling'.  He was placed on
oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  The casualty was
given water.  He was airlifted to a recompression facility where
he received a 6 hour treatment.  His symptoms fully resolved
within the first hour.

Two divers were diving on a wreck.  One of the pair ran out of
air and his buddy brought him to the surface, making a rapid
ascent.  At the surface the diver who was out of air was found to
be unconscious and his buddy was suffering DCI.  They were
recovered into their boat and the Coastguard was alerted.  The
two divers were airlifted to the shore and taken to hospital.
Both were reported to be recovering.  (Media report).

Dive support vessel contacted Brixham Coastguard reporting
having a diver aboard suffering from suspected DCI following a
dive to 20m, diver ran out of air whilst descending to find
missing camera, making a rapid ascent to the surface, casualty
airlifted to recompression chamber for treatment by RN
helicopter, met at airport by ambulance.  (Coastguard report).
July 2004 04/305
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 40m.  With
120 bar remaining he started a slow ascent to 6m where his
computer indicated a 3 min stop.  When this was completed his
buddy's computer indicated that a further 1 min was required.
They completed this additional stop time and ascended to the
surface.  Once out of the water he walked up a slope and
noticed that his chest felt tight and that he was breathing
heavily.  He dekitted, unzipped his drysuit and sat down.  After
about 15 min his left lower leg went numb and he had 'pins and
needles' in his right leg and left toes.  Thinking that it might be
poor circulation he removed his drysuit and undersuit.  The
condition in his left leg deteriorated, his thigh was numb and he
was unable to feel the floor when he tried to stand.  A
recompression facility was contacted and the diver was placed
on oxygen.  He was airlifted to the recompression chamber
where he was treated.  He was kept in hospital overnight and
discharged the following day.

A pair of divers conducted a dive to a depth of 31m.  As the end
of their no-stop time approached they deployed a delayed SMB
and started their ascent with a 1 min stop at 3m indicated by
their computers.  At 7m one of the pair lost control of her
buoyancy and ascended to the surface without a stop.  At the
surface her computer indicated 5 min of missed decompression
stops.  Her buddy surfaced more slowly and his computer was
clear.  The diver who had made a rapid ascent was placed on
oxygen and the boat returned to shore.  Medical advice was
sought and the diver was taken by ambulance to a
recompression facility where she received two sessions of
treatment for DCI.
August 2004 04/296
A diver conducted a dive to 46m for a duration of 65 min
including a 1 min stop at 9m, a 6 min stop at 6m and a 27 min
stop at 3m.  Shortly after this dive he noticed a tight sensation
around the area of his left cuff seal and an ache in the biceps of
his left arm.  He thought that this was due to a pulled muscle.
After a surface interval of 1 hour 41 min he dived to 30m for 18
min.  The following morning he awoke with a pain in his arm
muscle and a small circular rash at the base of his neck.  He
sought diving medical advice and went to a recompression
facility where he received treatment.  His symptoms improved
and he had two further treatment sessions over the next two
days.
August 2004 04/343
A diver completed a series of six dives over a three day period.
On the third day she dived to 29m for 28 min including a 5 min
stop at 6m and, after a 3 hour 19 min surface interval, she dived
to 18m for 31 min including a 6 min stop at 6m.  Early the
following morning she was woken up by pains in her ankles and
elbows.  These pains started to spread to other joints.  She
sought diving medical advice and went to a recompression
facility.  She received a recompression treatment and a further
treatment the following day.  She made a full recovery.
Subsequent tests revealed that she had a PFO.

A diver completed a 30 min dive to a depth of 36m.  2 hours
later he dived to 12m for 32 min.  The following day he dived to
44m for 31 min.  2 hours later he dived to 19m for 30 min.  In all
cases the decompression stops indicated by his computer were
correctly carried out.  Later that day a pain developed in his
right shoulder.  The following day he contacted a recompression
facility and was advised to attend for examination.  DCI was
diagnosed and he was recompressed and had a further
treatment the day after.  His symptoms were fully resolved by
the second treatment.  His buddy conducted the same dives but
experienced no problems.

Three divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of
33m.  After about 18 min the computer of one of the three
indicated that 2 min of decompression was required and they
ascended to a high point of the wreck and deployed a delayed
SMB.  They ascended to 6m and carried out a precautionary 1
min stop.  They then ascended to 3m and carried out a further
stop of about 90 sec.  About 3 min after having got back in the
boat one of the three felt a slight 'stabbing' pain above his left
temple.  He then experienced dizziness and a severe weakness
in his legs.  He was laid down and placed on oxygen.  The
Coastguard was alerted and the diver and one of his buddies
were airlifted to a recompression facility.  Normal function had
returned to the casualty's legs by the time he arrived at the
chamber but he was given a precautionary treatment.  Checks
the following day indicated that no further treatment was
required.

Injury / Illness
October 2003 04/009
Two divers completed a 24 min dive to 22m.  Shortly after
surfacing one of the pair began to feel dizzy, light-headed and
disorientated.  She was placed on oxygen and taken to hospital
from where she was discharged that evening.  It is thought that
she had an ear problem.
October 2003 04/010
Two divers completed a 17 min dive to 18m with a 3 min stop at
5m.  Shortly after leaving the water one felt sick, dizzy and
disorientated.  He sought medical advice and was taken by
ambulance to hospital.  He was placed on oxygen for 6 hours
and then discharged.  This diver had experienced similar
problems on previous dives.  He was advised to obtain a full
diving medical before further dives.
October 2003 04/510
Lifeboat launched to help diver with illness.  (RNLI report).
October 2003 04/061
A trainee diver began a descent.  At about 4m he had trouble
clearing his ears.  Then his right ear 'went pop' and he felt very
dizzy and could not keep his balance.  His buddy steadied him
and helped him to settle on the seabed at 14m.  After 15 min
they made their ascent and got back into the boat.  The trainee
was immediately sick.  Once ashore he needed help to change
out of his diving kit.  He still felt nauseous and his right ear had
no feeling in it.  He was taken to hospital and underwent a series
of tests.  He was released two days later, but was still
experiencing hearing and balance problems.
October 2003 04/388
Dive support vessel contacted Coastguard to inform that they
had a diver aboard suffering from a suspected broken ankle,
casualty was met by Coastguard team and ambulance for

October 2003 04/018
A group of three divers began a dive.  Two entered the water
from a boat and the third then rolled in backwards and landed on
top of one of the others.  They checked each other and then
conducted the dive.  Once back on the boat blood was seen
coming from under the hood of the third diver and a large lump
was observed on the side of his head.  The emergency services
were alerted by radio and the diver was met by a doctor when
they got back to the shore.  At this point the diver's hood was
removed and four stitches were required to close the wound to
his head.
October 2003 04/104
Two divers dived to a depth of 36m.  One of the divers then
indicated that he had 100 bar remaining.  As planned they
started their ascent following a slope upwards.  At 26m the diver
indicated that he was down to 50 bar and the dive leader then
decided to ascend directly to the surface.  The last 10m of their
ascent was un-controlled and fast.  Shortly after leaving the
water the dive leader complained of severe chest pains.  He was
placed on oxygen and taken by ambulance to hospital.  It was
later determined that he had suffered a heart attack.  His buddy
had been using a relatively new drysuit and felt that he may have
been over-weighted leading to his high air consumption.
October 2003 04/065
A diver made a dive to 7m for 43 min.  At the end of this dive she
had a slight headache.  2 hours later she dived to 18m for 36 min
with a 3 min safety stop at 6m.  After this dive she had a long
surface swim to get out of the water.  During this swim she
began to feel ill.  Once out of the water she felt dizzy, shaky and
nauseous.  The diver was placed on oxygen for 30 min which
helped her to recover.  It is believed that the air in her diving
cylinder contained a pollutant.

December 2003 04/074
A diver completed a dive to a maximum depth of 35m.  She
spent 6 min at this depth and then made a gradual ascent to the
surface, for a total dive time of 34 min.  About 30 min after the
dive she noticed 'pins and needles' in her left foot.  The condition
rapidly progressed and her left and right legs became numb.
She was helped out of her diving suit and placed on oxygen.
After 30 min the feeling rapidly returned to her legs.  This diver
suffers from arthritis in her right foot and has a slipped thoracic
disc and spondylosis of the lumbar area.  It was uncertain if the
problem was diving related or associated with her medical
condition.  Further medical advice was being sought.
January 2004 04/072
A person participated in a try-dive session in a swimming pool.
He was briefed on ear clearing techniques.  He dived with an
instructor and after some practice was taken to the deep end of
the pool where the depth was 4m.  They went back to the
shallow end and then again to the deep end.  The trainee was
prompted to clear his ears each time he descended.  On a third
descent he indicated that he had a problem with one of his ears
and he was led to the shallow end of the pool.  The trainee
stated that he felt slightly dizzy and nauseous.  He was
examined by his doctor and a perforated eardrum was
diagnosed.
February 2004 04/075
A trainee diver completed a 28 min dive to a depth of 7m.  2
hours later he dived again, this time to 11m for 30 min.  The
following day he complained of 'pins and needles' in his elbows
and wrists.  Medical advice was sought and the diver was
examined.  It was concluded that this was not a case of DCI and
no further action was taken.
February 2004 04/096
A trainee diver took part in a pool training session.  At the start of
the session she reported feeling unwell but insisted that she was
able to continue.  During the session she spent 20 min
underwater to a maximum depth of 1.8m.  Approximately 30
hours later she was admitted to hospital suffering from a
shortness of breath and shoulder pains.  She was diagnosed

NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2004  
©BSAC -2004 19
with an unspecified embolism.  She was discharged and then re-
admitted the following day, again suffering from a shortness of
breath.  A blood clot on her lung was diagnosed.  She had had a
cold but was symptom-free when she trained.  She had been a
heavy smoker until two months before the incident.  Following
further tests she was diagnosed as suffering from pneumonia.
February 2004 04/109
Two divers undertook a dive to a maximum depth of 26m.  They
were breathing nitrox 27 and nitrox 34.  At the end of the dive
both divers deployed a delayed SMB to make their ascent.  One
of the pair indicated that she was going to make a 1 min safety
stop at 6m.  At this point the other diver experienced breathing
problems and decided that she needed to go to the surface.  At
the surface her breathlessness became acute and she gave a
distress signal to the boat.  The other diver then surfaced and
the distressed diver was assisted into the boat.  On shore she
remained very breathless, she was coughing up pink sputum and
a bubbling sound could be heard from her chest as she
breathed.  She was placed on oxygen and medical advice was
sought.  She was diagnosed with pulmonary oedema by
immersion.  The diver recovered and no immediate medical
assistance was required.  This diver was taking a beta blocker
called Propranolol and it was considered that this was the
probable cause of the problem.  The diver had previously been
given the all clear to dive with this drug but recently the dosage
had been increased.

Lifeboat launched to help diver with illness.  (RNLI report).
March 2004 04/121
A pair of divers completed a 30 min dive to 21m and were
ascending.  At 10m one of the pair developed a problem and
swam rapidly to the surface.  His buddy followed.  At the surface
the troubled diver was seen to be in distress and the alarm was
raised.  He was recovered from the water and was found not to
be breathing.  Resuscitation techniques were applied and he
started to make a recovery.  He was airlifted to hospital.  It is
reported that this diver had heart problems and that this may
have been the cause of the incident.
March 2004 04/130
4 hours after diving to 20m for a duration of 35 min a diver felt
unwell.  His ascent had been a little fast at around 6m.  At the
surface he had been stressed and breathing heavily.  He was
placed on oxygen and made a recovery.
April 2004 04/131
A diver dived to 35m for 63 min  including 20 min of
decompression stops.  He then made a second dive to 22m for
47 min including decompression stops.  At 15m, on the second
dive, he felt that his 'head was spinning'.  He switched to an
alternative air source and the problem resolved.  On the way to
the surface he switched back and the problem returned.  The
diver was convinced that the air in his main cylinder was
contaminated.  The air source was checked and found to be
clean.  The diver declined a test of the air in his cylinder.  His
buddy stated that this diver had had a problem with his ears on
the second dive.
April 2004 04/132
A diver completed a 28 min dive to 21m.  After surfacing he
suddenly became dizzy and disorientated, and he felt cold.  He
was given oxygen and he quickly recovered.
April 2004 04/173
A diver completed a 23 min dive to a maximum depth of 15m.
Towards the end of the dive the divers were within 6m of the
surface and affected by swell.  They tried to conduct a 3 min
safety stop but the water movement made this difficult and one
of the pair made a quicker than intended ascent to the surface.
To compensate the diver made a additional safety stop on his
second dive.  Once ashore, after the second dive, he
experienced a numb, tingling feeling in his right arm.  This diver
suffered from a pre-existing problem with a nerve in his neck and
it was not certain if this was implicated.  The diver was placed on
oxygen and the emergency services were alerted.  The diver was
taken by ambulance to hospital.  It was concluded that the diver
did not have a DCI but that his neck complaint was the root
cause.  He was released from hospital later that day and advised
to seek specialist advice on his neck before diving again.
April 2004 04/145
Two divers began their descent.  One of the pair had problems
clearing her ears and they made a very slow descent.  At a depth
of 6m she heard a 'large bang' in her ear.  She and her buddy
ascended slowly.  She attended hospital where a perforated
eardrum was diagnosed.
April 2004 04/518
Lifeboat launched to help diver with injury.  Person brought in.
(RNLI report).
April 2004 04/156
A diver conducted a 28 min dive to a maximum depth of 33m.  3
hours 27 min later, she dived again with two other divers.  They
dived, on a wreck, to a maximum depth of 25m.  The diver was
cold at the start of the dive and after 10 min she began to
hyperventilate because she was cold.  She tried to calm herself
down.  5 min later she signalled to her buddies that she was cold
but this signal was missed by the buddies and the dive
continued.  After a further 5 min she signalled again and they
began to ascend back up the wreck towards the shotline.  When
she got to a depth of 12m she was hyperventilating again and
she lost buoyancy control.  She made a rapid ascent to the
surface.  At the surface she was in distress and was recovered
into the boat.  Her buddies did not see her ascend and made a
quick search before making a normal ascent up the shotline.
The distressed diver reported a slight pain in her left knee.  She
was placed on oxygen and the emergency services were alerted.
Actions were taken to re-warm the diver and by the time they
reached harbour her symptoms had resolved.  No further action
was taken.
April 2004 04/139
Three divers completed a 24 min dive to 19m with a 3 min stop
at 6m.  They terminated the dive early because they were cold.
One of the divers complained of extreme cold once he was back
on the shore.  He was sent to get changed but was later
observed sitting down, shivering.  He was again advised to get
changed but did not move.  He suddenly became very weak and
collapsed backwards.  He was moved into a vehicle for shelter.
A doctor on site thought that he was suffering from hypothermia.
The casualty was given oxygen, others helped to change and dry
him and wrapped him in an emergency blanket.  He was on the
verge of unconsciousness and an ambulance was called.   He
was recovering when the ambulance arrived.  An air ambulance
also arrived at the scene.  However the casualty was found to be
recovering wall and he was taken back to his accommodation
where he made a full recovery.
April 2004 04/141
Two divers completed a 30 min drysuit familiarization dive to a

NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2004
20 ©BSAC - 2004
depth of 19m.  At the surface one of the pair had difficulty
achieving positive buoyancy and appeared to panic.  He turned
grey and started to froth at the mouth.  A rescue boat arrived and
the casualty was found to have stopped breathing.  He was
recovered from the water and resuscitation techniques were
applied.  He was placed on oxygen and the emergency services
were called.  An air and a land ambulance responded.  The
casualty was taken by land ambulance to hospital from where he
was released a day later.  It is thought that health rather than
diving issues were responsible.  The diver stated that at the
surface he had not been able to find his inflation valve and had
panicked.
April 2004 04/140
A diver dived to 20m and later commenced a second dive.  On
the first dive he had problems clearing his ears but managed to
do so.  On the second dive he experienced ear problems again
at a depth of 3m.  He heard a 'strong pop' and his ear was
painful.  He aborted the dive.  A discharge was seen coming
from his ear.  He went to hospital and a ruptured eardrum was
diagnosed.
April 2004 04/142
Two divers completed a 37 min dive to a depth of 34m.  1 hour
30 min later they dived again.  This second dive was to a
maximum depth of 35m.  During the ascent, at a depth of 25m,
one of the pair was unable to dump air from his drysuit.  His
buddy tried to slow him down but he made a fast ascent to the
surface.  His buddy deployed a delayed SMB and made a normal
ascent.  The diver who had made the rapid ascent was
recovered from the water.  He felt slightly dizzy and he was
placed on oxygen.  His pupils were found to be reacting poorly
and diving medical advice was sought.  The diver was kept on
oxygen for an hour and given fluids.  After this hour he had
recovered and he went home with no further problems
encountered.
April 2004 04/201
A diver was fully kitted ready to dive from the shore.  She tripped
and fell.  She then completed a 26 min dive to 8m.  After the dive
her right ankle was very painful.  She went to hospital and it was
discovered that her ankle was broken.
April 2004 04/150
A diver was about 5 min into a dive when she started to become
short of breath, disorientated and confused with a loss of
coordination.  At 9m she developed a severe headache.  She
switched to her pony cylinder and started to feel better but still
confused.  After the dive she felt unwell and was placed on
oxygen.  the pillar valve was removed from her diving cylinder
and an oil-like film was found around the threads of the pillar
valve.  It was thought that the contamination had come from a
compressor during filling, but the source was not identified.
April 2004 04/266
Two divers were 4 min into a dive at a depth of 15m.  They made
a fast ascent to the surface missing a planned safety stop.  They
complained of feeling ‘light-headed’.  They were placed on
oxygen for 30 min and advised on hydration.  No subsequent ill
effects were experienced.
April 2004 04/418
Following a shore dive one of the party felt unwell, when
observed by a member of the public being pulled from the water
Coastguards were alerted.  Diver taken to A&E at Poole where
the condition was thought not to be dive related.  (Coastguard
report).
May 2004 04/419
Whilst preparing for a shore dive, a diver was washed into a rock
crevice and trapped by diving cylinder, whilst attempting to assist
the diver another sustained an injury to the knee, treated on the
scene by Coastguard personnel.  (Coastguard report).
May 2004 04/165
A trainee and an instructor undertook a dive to a depth of 8m.
They descended a shotline.  The trainee cleared her ears
successfully on two occasions but then felt the pressure building
in her left ear.  She signalled that she wanted to ascend a little
but her eardrum burst causing her severe pain and
disorientation.  Her instructor brought her to the surface and
signalled an emergency to the boat.  She was taken to hospital
and treated for a burst eardrum.
May 2004 04/424
Upon entry to the water diver hit the skeg of the outboard,
sustaining a head injury.  Vessel met by awaiting ambulance and
Coastguard team transported to hospital for treatment.
(Coastguard report).
May 2004 04/338
A trainee diver and an instructor dived to a depth of 6m.  At a
depth of 2m they practised mask clearing.  The trainee removed
his mask and water entered his nose.  The trainee had had
surgery to his nose ten years earlier which, unknown to the
trainee,  left it very sensitive.  The cold water caused him severe
pain.  The instructor brought the trainee to the surface using a
controlled buoyant lift.  No subsequent ill effects were
experienced.
May 2004 04/523
Lifeboat launched to help diver with illness.  Person brought in.
(RNLI report).
May 2004 04/206
A diver became stressed whilst preparing to dive and
complained of chest pains.  He was placed on oxygen and taken
to hospital.  A mild heart attack was diagnosed.
June 2004 04/211
A diver dived to 10m for 26 min.  2 hours 19 min later he dived to
7m for 28 min.  10 min after surfacing from the second dive,
which included multiple ascents, he complained of feeling unwell
and he had a slight rash across his chest.  He was placed on
oxygen and the emergency services were alerted.  The diver was
taken by ambulance to a hospital from where he was discharged
3 hours later.
June 2004 04/267
Two divers were conducting a training dive, one of them was
trying out a drysuit.  This diver made two fast ascents from 6m.
They continued the dive and, at about 9m, the diver who had
made the fast ascents developed a headache and had difficulty
clearing his ears.  They aborted the dive and surfaced with a 3
min safety stop at 3m.  Once out of the water the diver with the
headache was placed on oxygen.  His condition improved and
he was advised to seek medical advice on his ears and sinuses.
June 2004 04/234
A boat was traveling to a dive site in rough conditions.  Two

NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2004  
©BSAC -2004 21
divers in the boat saw a cylinder start to fall and both went to
grab it.  In doing so they banged their heads together.  One of
the two sustained a blow to his nose which then started to bleed
heavily.  The boat returned to the shore and the emergency
services attended.  It is thought that the diver may have broken
his nose.
June 2004 04/228
A diver was engaged in launching an RHIB.  He attempted to
connect the RHIB trailer to the back of a tractor but did not
realise that the ball hitch had not coupled securely.  He climbed
into the RHIB and the tractor driver began to reverse down the
slipway.  The trailer became disconnected and accelerated down
the slipway.  The tide was low and the slipway was 20 to 30m
long.  The trailer ran to one side and started to climb a bank
causing the boat and trailer to roll over.  The diver in the boat
jumped clear but injured his feet when he landed on the slipway.
He went to hospital where a fracture of his right foot and bruising
and a pulled tendon in his left foot were treated.
June 2004 04/212
A diver conducted a 35 min dive to a depth of 10m.  2 hours 14
min later he dived to 22m.  Whilst preparing for this second dive
he was slightly seasick but felt well enough to continue.  During
the dive he vomited again but did not alert his two buddies.  The
dive leader noticed that the sick diver seemed uncomfortable but
he did not indicate any problem.  After 25 min they started their
ascent up a shotline.  At 6m they stopped to complete a 3 min
stop.  At this point the diver vomited again and his regulator
became blocked.  One of his buddies handed him his octopus
regulator which he took.  The diver did not seem to be breathing
correctly so the dive leader, fearing that he might lose
consciousness, brought him to the surface in a rapid buoyant
ascent.  The third diver made a normal ascent.  At the surface
the dive leader signalled for the boat to recover them.  Once in
the boat the sick diver was placed on oxygen but he continued to
vomit.  The Coastguard was alerted and the two divers were
airlifted to a recompression facility.  The dive leader was
discharged after 3 hours and the sick diver was discharged the
following day.  Neither experienced any other symptoms.
June 2004 04/214
Two divers completed a 31 min dive to a depth of 21m including
a 3 min stop at 5m.  Towards the end of the dive one of the pair
began to feel unwell and was sick underwater.  She was sick
again after leaving the water.  She was placed on oxygen and
given water.  She made a full recovery.  The weather was very
warm and the diver may have been dehydrated.
June 2004 04/215
A trainee diver was going down some steps to enter the water
when he slipped and fell.  He hit his head and fell into the water.
Others helped him out.  His only injury was a black eye.
June 2004 04/222
After completing a dive a diver used a dive boat's lift to get back
into the boat.  The sea conditions were rough and she lost her
balance and fell over.  She was unable to put any weight on her
right leg and was assisted to dekit.  She thought that she had a
bad sprain.  Later that day the leg and ankle were still very
painful and swollen.  She attended her local hospital and a
fractured fibula was diagnosed.
June 2004 04/333
A diver conducted a dive to 30m for 51 min with a 15 min stop at
6m.  Later that day she completed a dive to 21m for 61 min with
a 5 min stop at 6m.  She then returned to her accommodation
where she felt cold and tired and so she went to bed.  Later she
got up and sat in the sunshine but when she went indoors again
she still felt tired and returned to bed, with a hot drink and a hot
water bottle.  That evening she suffered severe cramp in her calf
muscles.  Medical advice was sought by phone and the casualty
was taken to hospital.  Hypothermia and dehydration were
diagnosed.  The casualty recovered.
June 2004 04/271
A diver conducted two dives.  After the second dive he noticed
blood coming from his ear.  He went to hospital for examination.
July 2004 04/275
Two divers were returning up an underwater slope after a dive to
35m.  At 15m one of the pair lost control of his buoyancy and
started to ascend.  His buddy pulled him back down and they
completed their decompression stops before surfacing.  After the
dive the buoyant diver suffered shoulder pain and nausea and
his buddy experienced some tingling in his left leg.  Both were
placed on oxygen and both recovered.  Tiredness and lack of
food may have been contributory factors.
July 2004 04/240
A diver was exploring a wreck at a depth of 30m.  He saw a
lobster through an opening in the wreck.  He reached in to grab
the lobster and a conger eel, which was approximately 3m long,
bit into his hand.  The eel pulled him into the wreck.  The diver
pulled back but the eel would not release its grip.  He used his
other hand to take hold of the eel and his hand was released.
He sustained bite injuries to his hand and bruising to his face
caused by contact with the wreck.  (Media report).
July 2004 04/249
A diver was leaving the water using a boat lift, in rough
conditions, when she lost her balance, fell, and fractured her
ankle.
July 2004 04/302
A trainee diver was preparing to enter the water for a shore dive.
She turned around to reach her regulator and over-balanced.
She fell over and twisted her knee.  She was in considerable
pain and an ambulance was called.  She was taken to hospital
where torn ligaments in her knee were diagnosed.
July 2004 04/276
Three divers prepared for a dive.  One of the three reported that
his back was hurting but he stated that he was fit to dive.  The
others carried his kit to the entry point and helped him to kit up.
They conducted a dive to a depth of 6m but during the return
swim the injured diver started to experience difficulties.  The
three made a safe ascent to the surface where the casualty was
made positively buoyant.  One of his buddies towed him to the
shore and the casualty was landed with assistance from others.
He was taken by ambulance to hospital.  Examination revealed
that he was suffering from bruised ribs, sustained before the dive
in a non-diving related activity.
July 2004 04/298
A diver stepped out of a boat at a slipway.  He fell on the slipway
and landed in the water between it and the boat, injuring his left
foot.  He walked from the water but became faint and collapsed
onto the ground.  He was placed on oxygen and his condition
improved.  About 4 hours later he became faint again, with
blurred vision.  He experienced great pain in his foot, which was
swollen.  He was taken by ambulance to hospital.  No fracture

was found and he was released from hospital the following day.
July 2004 04/295
Three pairs of divers dived on a wreck to a maximum depth of
39m.  During the dive one of the divers came across a diver from
one of the other pairs hanging in the water, motionless and
without a regulator in his mouth.  He swam to this diver and
placed one of his regulators into his mouth.  He did not respond
so the diver tried another of the troubled diver’s regulators.  He
purged the regulator and the diver seemed to be breathing.
They were sinking down beside the wreck so the rescuer
attempted to inflate the casualty’s suit, but he could not find the
direct feed.  At this point the casualty’s buddy arrived and was
able to locate and operate his direct feed.  They brought him to
the top of the wreck.  The buddy deployed a delayed SMB and
the three started their ascent.  At 10m the rescuer’s computer
indicated 10 min of decompression stops were required.  At this
point the casualty started to convulse.  The casualty and his
buddy were buoyant and continued to the surface.  The rescuer
stopped and conducted a 5 min stop using nitrox.  At the surface
the casualty was recovered onto a dive platform at the back of
the boat.  The rescuer and the buddy were recovered into the
boat and the Coastguard was alerted.  The casualty, who was
initially unconscious, was placed on oxygen and airlifted to a
recompression facility for treatment.  A lifeboat was launched to
help to recover the other divers who had been left whilst the boat
manoeuvred to facilitate the helicopter recovery of the casualty.
The casualty recovered.  He had been diving with a main
cylinder and a pony cylinder both filled with air, and a side slung
cylinder containing nitrox 65 for decompression.  After the
incident his main and pony cylinders were found to be empty but
his main regulator had been venting whilst he was recovered into
the boat and his rescuers had been able to inflate his BCD.  The
casualty reports having run out of air at depth and is unsure if he
was unable to find his pony regulator or did not think to do so.  It
was thought that the diver entered the water using his pony
regulator in error; when this cylinder was exhausted he assumed
that his main supply had failed and was then unable to locate his
pony regulator, which was already in his mouth.
July 2004 04/279
A diver conducted a dive to 21m for 39 min.  2 hours later he
dived to 9m for 9 min.  2 hours later he commenced a third dive
to a depth of 6m.  At the start of this dive he began to feel unwell
with a ‘thick head’ and a ‘funny feeling’ in his lips.  He aborted
the dive, was placed on oxygen and started to recover.  It is
thought that his air may have been contaminated.
August 2004 04/291
A diver had participated in a pool training session that lasted 75
min and involved diving to a maximum depth of 3m.  After the
session he complained of ‘pins and needles’ and a swollen right
hand.  He sought medical advice and was placed on oxygen.  He
was then transferred to a recompression facility for treatment.
The casualty had been involved in a serious accident seven
years earlier and had very severe scarring and tissue damage
around his shoulders and back.
August 2004 04/309
Three divers descended a shotline to a wreck in a depth of 39m.
One of the three began to be affected by nitrogen narcosis at a
depth of 36m.  She had a feeling of 'unreality', her thought
processes slowed and she had some confusion.  She stopped
and the feeling subsided.  She descended to the bottom where
she experienced visual disturbances and lightheadedness.  The
dive leader signalled that they should move towards the wreck
but the diver with narcosis did not respond.  The dive leader
brought the troubled diver to the surface using a controlled
buoyant lift and they were recovered into the boat.  The casualty
was placed on oxygen and quickly recovered.  No symptoms
developed and no further action was taken.
August 2004 04/341
A trainee diver completed two 20 min dives to 6m twice in one
day.  The following day she dived again to 6m.  She was
engaged in mask clearing drills when she indicated to her
instructor that she wanted to ascend.  At the surface she
complained of a headache, similar to that caused by eating ice-
cream.  The water temperature at 6m was 18 deg C and she had
been diving without a hood.  She was placed on oxygen but the
pain remained.  She was taken by ambulance to hospital.  The
problem persisted but was not thought to be diving-related.
Further medical tests were planned.
August 2004 04/310
A diver completed a 40 min dive to a depth of 10m.  During this
dive he had a problem clearing his ears but felt able to make a
second dive.  75 min later he dived to 12m.  As he descended on
this second dive he felt a sharp pain in his left ear.  As they
ascended from this dive his buddy saw blood coming from his
ear.  After the dive he reported that his ear felt painful and he
went to hospital for examination.
August 2004 04/484
Stornoway Coastguard requested Coastguard rescue helicopter
to stand-by as a report had come in from Clyde Coastguard of a
diver aboard a dive support vessel  suffering from suspected
DCI.  Following a call to a doctor the dive vessel reported taking
the diver ashore to be seen at local hospital, not thought to be
diving related, Coastguard rescue helicopter R-MU and all other
units stood down.  (Coastguard report).
August 2004 04/324
A diver conducted a dive to 26m with a 5 min safety stop and a
second dive to 25m with a 4 min safety stop.  That evening he
noticed a numbness in his lower left arm.  The problem persisted
and he sought medical advice.  Medical examination revealed no
DCI-related symptoms and he was asked to return for
examination the following morning.  When he did so possible
DCI-related symptoms were found and the diver was taken by
lifeboat to a recompression facility where he was treated.  The
final diagnosis was of a non-diving related trapped nerve in his
left arm.
August 2004 04/325
Two divers conducted a dive on a wreck to a maximum depth of
24m.  They were swimming along the top of the wreck when one
of the pair thought that she had a leak in her drysuit.  She
communicated this to her buddy and he checked but could find
no problem.  She began to feel buoyant and held on to part of
the wreck.  She signalled that she wanted to ascend and her
buddy deployed a delayed SMB.  During the ascent the troubled
diver felt that she wanted to go to sleep and she held onto the
other diver.  She then lost consciousness and released her grip.
The other diver checked that her regulator was still in place and
brought her to the surface using a controlled buoyant lift.  They
were recovered into their boat and the casualty was placed on
oxygen.  The Coastguard was alerted and the boat headed back
to shore leaving another boat to recover the remaining divers.
The diver was taken to a recompression facility but no DCI was
found.  She slowly recovered and was declared fit the following
morning.
September 2004 04/345
A diver and an instructor were engaged in an advanced nitrox
course.  They were using nitrox 32 with nitrox 50 for

decompression.  They dived to 35m and then made their ascent
with a 10 min stop at 21m, a 1 min stop at 12m and they were
making a stop at 9m when the trainee seemed to suffer a
convulsion.  He then started to sink back down.  The instructor
went after him, arrested the descent at 15m, and brought them
both to the surface.  At the surface the trainee was not breathing.
He was recovered from the water and quickly responded to
resuscitation.  He was airlifted to a recompression facility for
treatment and released the following day.  Oxygen poisoning
was thought to have been the cause.
September 2004 04/342
A pair of divers conducted a dive to 33m.  Near the start of the
dive, at a depth of 30m, one of the pair signalled that she wanted
to ascend.  They started their ascent.  Her buddy gave the 'OK'
signal and received the 'ascend' signal in response.  At 17m the
troubled diver gave the 'ascend' signal again with a sense of
urgency and her buddy assisted her to the surface in a faster
than normal ascent.  At the surface the troubled diver was
unresponsive.  She was removed from the water and CPR was
applied and a defibrillator was used on her.  The emergency
services were alerted and the casualty was airlifted to a
recompression facility.  On arrival she was conscious.  She was
given a precautionary recompression treatment and made a full
recovery.
September 2004 04/501
Dive support vessel contacted Shetland Coastguard requesting
medical assistance for a diver who had collapsed on the deck of

dive using an SMB.  After they had descended the engine of the
RHIB cut out and the cox was unable to restart it.  He checked
the fuel which was found to be half full.  The boat was drifting
away from the divers so the cox deployed an anchor.  He then
radioed the harbour authority and another dive boat was
dispatched to help.  The other boat safely recovered the divers
and they then managed to restart the engine of the RHIB.  It
was found that the engine had exhibited problems earlier that
day.

April 2004 04/548
A number of dive boats were operating around a crowded wreck
site.  A pair of divers were surfacing under a delayed SMB
when a large hardboat drove over the buoy, despite the divers'
boat cover trying to prevent this.  The SMB line was caught
around the propeller of the large boat and pulled in.  The diver
released the reel which was damaged by the propeller.  The
diver hit his head against the hull of the boat but was able to
push himself away from the propeller.  They surfaced without
further incident and neither diver suffered any resultant ill
effects.  The hardboat skipper returned to check that no injury
had been caused and to apologise.
April 2004 04/519

report).
April 2004 04/164
A group of seven divers were on their way to a dive site in an
RHIB.  After 20 min of travel the engine began to lose power.
The cox closed the throttle and the engine cut out.  Checks
were made for obvious problems but none were found and the
engine could not be restarted.  They attempted to radio another
dive boat and they sought assistance from another branch
member by phone but to no avail.  They then contacted the
Coastguard and alerted them of their predicament.  Another
dive boat in the area monitored the call and offered assistance.
They were safely towed back to the harbour.  The engine had
been recently rebuilt.

Whilst in attendance at popular diving location conducting PR
the Porthoustock Coastguard rescue team noticed that a dive
RHIB was looking in the wrong area for their divers whilst the
divers were observed waving to the vessel.  This was reported
to the MRCC who attempted to raise the vessel on VHF
channel 16 with no success.  Other vessel responded and
recovered divers to own RHIB, it transpired the vessel had its
VHF radio tuned to channel 73.  Safety advice was given to the
owner.  (Coastguard report).

Dive support vessel made a 999 call reporting had run aground
with 2 pob, immediately Coastguards tasked AWLB, inshore
lifeboat and Coastguard rescue team to assist.  Lifeboat was
unable to tow off and the Coastguard vehicle was used to
ensure the vessel dried out upright and thus preventing a
pollution risk as the vessel had on board 1000 gallons of diesel
fuel and 35 gallons of lube oil.  This was of some concern for
local fish farms.  Vessel subsequently towed off and made way
to harbour under her own power.  (Coastguard and RNLI

of the rescue units.  (Coastguard report).
May 2004 04/300
A group of three pairs of divers conducted a dive to a depth of
12m.  After a surface interval of 3 hours 15 min they made a
second dive.  At the second site another group had already
deployed a shotline and did not want them to deploy theirs as
they had divers underwater.  Two pairs entered the water using
the other group's shotline.  They dived to a depth of 18m.
When the other group had finished their dive the pair in the boat
deployed their own shotline.  The two pairs were recovered into
the boat and the last pair commenced their dive.  When they got
to the bottom of the shot it was not on the wreck site.  One of
the divers attached a lifting bag and partially inflated it to aid
later recovery.  Unknown to the divers in the boat the shot buoy

NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2004
26 ©BSAC - 2004
was now drifting with the current and they stayed with it.  The
pair underwater deployed a delayed SMB after 28 min and
surfaced.  At the surface they could see the boat but they were
not spotted by the boat crew.  The boat crew became
concerned when the divers were overdue and they then
discovered, from GPS readings, that they were off the wreck
site.  They returned to the site but could not locate their divers.
They contacted the Coastguard and a lifeboat and a helicopter
were tasked to search.  The divers were located quickly by the

A party of divers were diving on a wreck from an RHIB.  The
first pair were recovered but the cox was then unable to restart
the engine.  The boat was anchored and the Coastguard was
alerted.  The last three divers then surfaced and swam 400m to
get to the boat.  The Coastguard was informed that all divers
were safely recovered.  A lifeboat towed the disabled boat to
harbour.  Subsequently a fault was found with the starter motor.
The engine had been rebuilt one week earlier by a service
agent.
June 2004 04/217
A group of divers were traveling to a dive site in an RHIB.  The
sea was calm and they were traveling at about 25 knots.  One
of the divers was sitting in the bow holding on to the painter.
The boat suddenly encountered two waves close to each other.
The cox shouted a warning but the diver in the bow was thrown
into the air and landed by the console.  He struck his arm
causing a fracture close to his wrist.  The waves are thought to
have been the wash from nearby naval vessels.  The broken
arm was strapped and supported in a sling.  The boat returned
to harbour and the diver was taken to hospital where the joint
was pinned and set.

A group of divers were on their way to a dive site.  They were 4
miles offshore when the outboard engine of their boat started to
slow down.  Seconds later it stopped and could not be
restarted.  They anchored the boat and after making
unsuccessful attempts to locate a fault they contacted the
Coastguard.  Their call was overheard by a nearby fishing
vessel which towed them back to the shore.  Subsequent
examination of the engine revealed that a camshaft drive
sprocket retaining bolt had failed causing damage to the
camshaft.  The manufacturer claimed that this was due to the
engine being run with a low oil level, but this was refuted by the
divers.

divers, two lifeboats and Coastguard rescue helicopter
proceeded to the scene, the helicopter recovered the missing
divers returning them to an assisting vessel and subsequently
to their own boat.  (Coastguard and RNLI reports).
July 2004 04/263
Two divers commenced a dive close to a small island.  Their
plan was to surface at the other end of the island.  Once
underwater they discovered that the current at 10m was flowing
in the opposite direction to that anticipated.  They attempted to
deploy a delayed SMB but the reel failed.  Whilst struggling with
the SMB they were carried to a depth of 30m.  They aborted the
dive and ascended, making a decompression stop at 6m.  At
the surface they discovered that they were a considerable
distance from their boat and were not seen by the boat crew.
The Coastguard was alerted when it was realised that the
divers were overdue.  A search was initiated involving a
helicopter and a lifeboat.  The divers were found after 2 hours at
the surface by the helicopter.  They were safely recovered into
the lifeboat.
July 2004 04/277
Seven divers on an RHIB were engaged in a dive on a wreck.
Two divers entered the water and when the cox attempted to
move away he could not shift the gearbox out of neutral.
Assistance was sought from nearby RHIBs and one of these
came to help.  The crew of the disabled RHIB deployed their
anchor and the assisting RHIB recovered the two divers.  The
Coastguard was alerted and a lifeboat was launched to tow the
disabled boat back to the shore.  A broken clutch cable was
later found to have been the cause.  It is alleged that one of the
boats requested to assist refused to do so; this was reported to
the Coastguard.
July 2004 04/254
The Coastguard was alerted when two divers were overdue
from a 30m drift dive.  A search was initiated involving a

Ascents
October 2003 04/013
Two divers were conducting a night dive and, at a depth of 32m,
one of them experienced a problem with her mask.  The divers
made a rapid ascent to the surface.  No subsequent ill effects
were experienced.
October 2003 04/393
Diver 10 years old rapid ascent from 5m, airlifted to
recompression chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard report).
October 2003 04/033
An instructor and two pairs of divers began an ascent to a
planned depth of 30m.  The instructor and the first pair reached
30m, but one of the second pair put too much air into his drysuit
at 23m and made a buoyant ascent to the surface.  His buddy
went with him.  The buoyant diver's computer indicated an
alarm due to a rapid ascent and missed stops.  The instructor
and the other divers aborted the dive and made a normal
ascent and the group left the water.  The buoyant diver and his
buddy were placed on oxygen for 90 min and given water.  No
adverse effects were reported.
November 2003 04/077
A trainee and an instructor were surfacing from a dive to a
maximum depth of 18m.  The trainee was operating the SMB.
He was struggling to ascend and kept adding air to his BCD.
The instructor corrected this each time to slow the ascent.  At
10m the trainee was approaching his reserve level; the
instructor took the SMB and the trainee held the line.  At 8m the
trainee made a rapid ascent to the surface.  The instructor
followed at a normal rate.  Neither diver suffered subsequent ill
effect.  The trainee stated that he had felt claustrophobic and
panicked.
November 2003 04/035
Two divers completed a dive to 21m and were ascending.  At
6m one of the pair lost control of his buoyancy and made an
uncontrolled ascent to the surface.  Once out of the water he
was placed on oxygen and treatment was given to a cut to his
hand.  No subsequent ill effects were experienced.
November 2003 04/364
Two divers entered the water, swam to a shotline and
descended to the bottom at 20m.  They spent about 6 min at
this depth and then swam to a depth of 17m.  At this point one
of the pair experienced buoyancy control problems and started
to ascend.  The dump valve of his drysuit did not seem to work
correctly and he was carried to the surface.  He then re-
descended with his buddy and they conducted a 5 min
decompression stop at 5m.  Their total dive time was 28 min.
No subsequent ill effects were experienced.  It is thought that
the drysuit dump valve was blocked by talcum powder.
November 2003 04/078
Two divers began a night dive.  They descended to 6m and
then followed a slope down to 20m.  The dive leader had
difficulty reading his computer with his torch since the torch
illuminated all of the elements of the liquid crystal display.  They
then unintentionally went down to a depth of 35m due to the
difficulty in reading the computer.  Finally realising how deep
they were, the dive leader signalled that they should ascend.  At
around 26m the dive leader thought that their ascent had
stopped and they attempted to continue to the surface.
Suddenly they found themselves in a cloud of bubbles and they
broke the surface having made a very rapid ascent.
Subsequent examination of the buddy's drysuit dump valve
revealed that it was faulty.  Neither diver suffered any  ill effect.
November 2003 04/038
Two divers were at a depth of 20m when one of the pair had his
regulator knocked from his mouth.  He attempted to use his
pony regulator but rapidly ran out of air.  He started to use his
buddy's alternative air source but was not comfortable and he
made for the surface.  He made a rapid ascent to the surface
from 10m.  No subsequent ill effects were experienced.
December 2003 04/398
Coastguard co-ordinated the recovery of two divers who had
missed decompression stops, both were airlifted to
recompression chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard report).
December 2003 04/399
Dive support vessel called for assistance following a diver
having missed a decompression stop, airlifted to recompression
chamber for assistance.  (Coastguard report).
December 2003 04/119
A trainee diver was to be taken on his first open water dive
using a drysuit in cold water.  He entered the water with an
instructor and three other divers.  The trainee completed some
training in a depth of 6m, but did not seem confident or
competent.  He was then taken into deeper water.  At a depth of
10m he began to experience problems.  He spat out his
regulator and, in apparent panic, pulled his mask off.  Attempts
were made to place an alternative air source in his mouth but
these failed.  Another diver brought him to the surface; they
made a rapid ascent.  At the surface the diver was conscious
but not breathing properly.  He was recovered from the water.
The dive instructor is reported to have denied a request to
provide this diver with oxygen and no alarm was raised at the
time.  The instructor advised the diver and his buddy to drive to
a local hospital.  The two divers were refered from hospital to a
recompression facility where they received treatment.
January 2004 04/079
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 22m.  At
20m one of the pair experienced a free flow of his regulator.  He
used an alternative air source and made a faster than normal
ascent to the surface.  Their total dive time was 20 min.  No
subsequent ill effects were experienced.
January 2004 04/081
Two divers both experienced regulator free flows at a depth of
34m.  They made a faster than normal ascent to the surface.
They were given oxygen.  Their dive duration was 12 min.  No
subsequent ill effects were experienced.
January 2004 04/082
An instructor and a trainee were at a depth of 18m when the
trainee's regulator began to free flow.  He used his own
alternative air source and then tried unsuccessfully to switch to
the instructor's pony regulator.  Their ascent from 12m was
rapid.  Both were placed on oxygen.  No subsequent ill effects
were experienced.

NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2004  
©BSAC -2004 31
January 2004 04/064
Two divers made a dive to a depth of 25m.  At this depth, one of
the divers added too much air to his drysuit and began to
ascend.  He was unable to control his buoyancy and made a
rapid, uncontrolled ascent to the surface.  His dive duration was
about 15 min.  His buddy followed him to 18m and then made a
normal ascent including a 3 min safety stop at 6m.  Both divers
were safely recovered into the boat.  The Coastguard was
alerted.  The diver who had made the rapid ascent was later
placed on oxygen.  No ill effects were experienced.
February 2004 04/083
Two divers were practicing the use of a delayed SMB at a depth
of 18m.  They lost control of their buoyancy and made a rapid
ascent to the surface.  Their dive duration was 20 min.  Both
were placed on oxygen.  No subsequent ill effects were
experienced.
February 2004 04/085
Three divers dived to a depth of 36m.  On their ascent, at a
depth of 14m, the drysuit inflation valve of one of the divers
jammed and he became buoyant.  One of his buddies hung on
to him but was unable to prevent a rapid ascent to the surface.
He was given oxygen but suffered no ill effects.
February 2004 04/106
A diver was diving with a new undersuit and undersuit boots.
She descended with her buddy to a maximum depth of 29m.
She felt a little light.  She then found that her feet easily slipped
out of the drysuit boots.  Her fins stayed attached to the drysuit
boots.  She had to keep pulling her drysuit legs to get her feet
back into the boots.  After about 20 min they moved up over a
rock and she was unable to release air from her cuff dump; it is
thought that the undersuit had blocked the inside of the valve.
She became inverted and made an uncontrolled ascent to the
surface with her feet out of the drysuit boots.  Her buddy went
with her, attempting to slow the ascent.  Their total dive time
was 24 min.  The buddy's computer indicated missed
decompression stops.  The computer of the buoyant diver failed
during the dive, indicating a fixed depth of 36m and dive
duration of 20 min.     No subsequent ill effects were
experienced.
February 2004 04/100
A diver was on his third dive of the day; he had previously dived
to 23m for 24 min and to 6m for 22 min.  At 18m his regulator
began to free flow.  He tried to use his octopus regulator but he
was unable to get enough air from it so he ditched his
weightbelt and made a fast ascent to the surface.  He was
recovered from the water and seemed to have trouble breathing
properly.  He was taken by ambulance  to hospital.
February 2004 04/101
Two divers completed a dive to 28m for 24 min with a 1 min
stop at 6m.  Later they dived again to 22m.  At 16m the
regulator of one of the divers began to free flow.  They made a
fast ascent to the surface.  Their dive duration was 15 min.  The
diver with the free flow was placed on oxygen for 20 min as a
precaution.  No subsequent ill effects were noted.
March 2004 04/409
Dive support vessel contacted Coastguard reporting having two
divers aboard having missed 5 to 6 min of stops following a dive
to 53m, a medi link was established and the Coastguard
helicopter scrambled.  Upon arrival the divers refused to come
off the dive boat and accepting the risk remained onboard,
medical advice required they do not re-enter the water and are
monitored closely. Whilst on scene the aircrew took an elderly
man 79 who was seasick ashore for medical treatment.
(Coastguard report).
March 2004 04/122
An instructor, a trainee, and another diver entered the water for
a night dive.  The plan was for the trainee to practice compass
use.  The trainee was wearing an unfamiliar drysuit with a new
undersuit.  She had buoyancy problems and struggled to
descend to 6m.  At the bottom the trainee commenced the
compass work, but, whilst doing so, she lost control of her
buoyancy and rose to the surface.  She re-descended and the
other two divers put rocks in her BCD pockets to help her stay
down.  They then moved down an underwater cliff to deeper
water.  The trainee started to descend quickly.  She was fully
occupied trying to clear her ears and unable to put air into her
drysuit or BCD.  At the bottom the instructor attached a buddy
line to the trainee and started to move off.  The trainee was on
her hands and knees on the bottom.  She tried to fin but could
not get off the bottom.  At this point she developed a bad cramp
down the back of her leg.  She used the buddy line to attract
attention.  She became anxious and started to hyperventilate.
She signalled that she wanted to ascend.  She put a lot of air
into her suit or BCD (she was uncertain which).  She started a
rapid ascent.  The buddy line held her back and she struggled
to release it.  The trainee and instructor made a rapid ascent to
the surface.  The third diver made a normal ascent.  They
assisted the troubled diver from the water.  No subsequent ill
effects were experienced.
March 2004 04/129
Two divers were at a depth of 21m  when one of their regulators
began to free flow.  They made a fast ascent to the surface,
missing planned safety stops.  Their dive duration was 18 min.
No subsequent ill effects were experienced.
March 2004 04/410
Following a dive to 61m on trimix, a diver lost control on ascent
missing 30 min of stops, on surfacing given oxygen, casualty
was airlifted by Coastguard helicopter to recompression
chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard report).
April 2004 04/126
At a depth of 16m a diver used her octopus regulator to inflate a
delayed SMB.  The SMB was deployed but the regulator started
to free flow and could not be stopped.  She felt that she could
not get enough air from her main regulator and therefore used
her buddy's pony regulator.  This also seemed restricted and
the diver became stressed with the decreasing visibility and the
bubbles from the free flowing regulator.  She switched to her
buddy's octopus regulator.  The SMB was abandoned and the
divers began to sink.  At 26m the buddy used her own
buoyancy to bring both to the surface.  At the surface the diver
with the free flow did not have sufficient air to gain buoyancy so
the buddy supported her until she was recovered into the boat.
Their dive duration was 23 min.  Computer data showed that
they had ascended from 26m in 1 min.  Both divers were placed
on oxygen.  No subsequent ill effects were experienced.  It was
later found that the free flowing regulator, which had an
adjustable second stage, had been set to the 'sensitive' setting,
and it was known to be susceptible to free flow under this
condition.
April 2004 04/134
Two divers completed a dive to 19m for 20 min.  2 hours 51 min
later they dived to 19m for 15 min.  At 17m they deployed a
delayed SMB.  One diver held the SMB reel while the other
diver inflated it.  The reel jammed and pulled the diver holding it

upwards.  His buddy tried to prevent a buoyant ascent and took
the reel from the ascending diver.  However this diver was
unable to control her buoyancy and made a rapid ascent to the
surface.  Her buddy followed, making a normal ascent.  Both
were safely recovered into their boat.  No subsequent ill effects
were experienced.

A diver conducted a dive to 29m.  He was used to diving with a
pony cylinder and a torch powered by a battery pack mounted
with his main cylinder.  On this dive he took neither but failed to
add weight to compensate.  During the ascent, at a depth of
4m, he lost control of his buoyancy and was carried to the
surface, missing an indicated 19 min of stops.  His buddy
remained at the stop depth.  The buoyant diver requested more
weights from the boat and re-descended to conduct his stops.
His buddy was using nitrox 57 and after he had finished his
compulsory stops he passed his main regulator to the diver who
had made the buoyant ascent.  Others in the boat lowered
another cylinder with nitrox 82 and he switched over to this
cylinder.  He completed his stops plus a further 3 min and then
surfaced.  His total dive time was 73 min including 25 min at
4m.  He was recovered into the boat and placed on oxygen.
They returned to the shore.  The diver completed three 25 min
sessions breathing oxygen with a 5 min break between each,
breathing air.  He did not develop symptoms and no further
action was taken.
April 2004 04/137
Two divers were at a depth of 35m when one of them
developed a problem.  She believed that her regulator began to
free flow and she made a rapid ascent to the surface.  Her dive
duration was 11 min.  It is thought that she may have suffered
from narcosis.  At the surface her cylinder was empty.  She was
placed on oxygen.  No subsequent ill effects were experienced.
April 2004 04/200
An instructor and two trainees were at 32m.  One of the trainees
had a free flow and started a fast ascent.  During the ascent, at
27m, the other trainee also had a free flow and spat out his
regulator.  The instructor held another regulator in the trainee's
mouth and purged it throughout the ascent.  Both trainees were
placed on oxygen but no ill effects were experienced.
May 2004 04/420
Forth Coastguard received a call from a dive support vessel
reporting having a diver suffering suspected DCI following a
rapid ascent, on return to shore the diver was examined by
ambulance crew it was decided that no further treatment was
necessary.  (Coastguard report).
May 2004 04/182
Two divers completed a 43 min dive to a depth of 9m.  3 hours
13 min later they dived again.  Their plan was to conduct a drift
dive to a maximum depth of 20m.  One of the divers was unable
to tighten her weighbelt in the boat so she entered the water
with it loose, intending to tighten it up in the water.  They dived
to the seabed at a depth of 9m.  The diver with the loose
weightbelt forgot to tighten it and, after 9 min, it fell off.  The
diver was carried to the surface.  Her buddy heard her shout
and looked around for her.  He found her weightbelt, tied a line
to it and ascended.  The diver who had made a buoyant ascent
had a pain in her hip and knee.  She was placed on oxygen and
the party returned to the shore.  They contacted the Coastguard
and the diver and her buddy were airlifted to a recompression
facility.  Bruising, not DCI, was diagnosed and the divers were
discharged.  No subsequent ill effects were experienced.
May 2004 04/421
Diver made a rapid ascent from 6m surfaced complaining of
being cold, administered oxygen and given water, taken to
hospital casualty ward.  (Coastguard report).
May 2004 04/153
Three divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 22m.  At
this depth the regulator of one of the divers began to free flow.
He attempted to use his alternative air source but was unable to
find the regulator.  By mistake he found his BCD mouthpiece
but this was not configured as an alternative air source.  The
diver made a rapid ascent to the surface without a regulator. He
remembered to breathe out during his ascent.   His two buddies
followed at a normal rate.  The diver with the free flow had an
octopus regulator and a pony cylinder with its own regulator,
but, in panic, he was not able to make use of them.  No
subsequent ill effects were reported.
May 2004 04/320
A trainee diver was ascending from a depth of 20m.  At 16m his
weightbelt suddenly came off and fell away.  His buddy held on
to him and tried to slow the ascent.  They were both carried to
the surface.  They were recovered into the boat and placed on
oxygen.  The Coastguard was alerted and the two divers were
airlifted to a recompression facility.  No symptoms were present
in either diver but they were given a precautionary
recompression treatment.
May 2004 04/152
Two instructors and three students were engaged in a deep
diving course.  They completed a 30 min dive to 22m, a 24 min
dive to 20m and a 35 min dive to 20m on the first day.  The
following day they undertook a dive to 31m.  During this dive, at
a depth of 30m one of the regulators of one of the instructors
began to free flow.  He and the other instructor made a fast
ascent to the surface missing a planned 4 min safety stop at
3m.  Their dive time was 18 min.  The three students also
ascended directly to the surface at a faster than normal rate.
The two instructors, who had made the most rapid ascents,
were placed on oxygen for 30 min and monitored for symptoms.
No subsequent ill effects were reported.
May 2004 04/428
Diver lost buoyancy control and made a rapid ascent feet first
whilst wearing a drysuit, missing stops in the ascent.  Upon
surfacing the diver complained of a headache and was given
oxygen, treated by ambulance on return to harbour.
(Coastguard report).
May 2004 04/432
Dive vessel called into harbour to "drop off" two divers who had
made a rapid ascent.  They were told to go to the lifeboat
station and ask for oxygen, the vessel then returned to sea with
the remaining divers aboard.  The divers were given oxygen by
the lifeboat mechanic informing Humber Coastguard, medical
advice was sought and on that advice rescue helicopter R-128
transferred both divers to recompression chamber for treatment.
(Coastguard and RNLI reports).
May 2004 04/168
An instructor was diving with two trainees.  On the bottom, at
20m, one student had a problem with a loose weightbelt and
whilst this was being rectified the other trainee lost a fin.  The
trainee with the lost fin began to panic.  The fin was replaced
but the panic increased and the trainee began to rush to the
surface releasing their weightbelt.  The instructor grabbed both
trainee and weightbelt and was able to partially control the

NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2004  
©BSAC -2004 33
ascent.  During the ascent the weighbelt was dropped and they
made a buoyant ascent to the surface.  Their dive duration was
20 min.  The other trainee made a normal ascent.  No
subsequent ill effects were experienced.
May 2004 04/218
Two divers made a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 34m.
Towards the end of the dive they ascended to part of the wreck
at 23m.  At this point one of the divers was buoyant and he held
onto the other diver to stay down.  The plan was to ascend
using a delayed SMB but one of their computers already
showed a 1 min stop so they started their ascent without further
delay.  They ascended to the surface at a slightly faster than
normal rate.  Their dive time was 26 min.  One of their
computers indicated that 3 min of stops had been missed.
They were recovered from the water and placed on oxygen.
The Coastguard was alerted and medical advice was sought.
The divers remained on oxygen for 1 hour and were monitored
for symptoms of DCI.  No subsequent ill effects were
experienced and no further action was taken.
May 2004 04/204
A diver completed a 34m dive with 12 min of decompression
stops.  4 hours later he made a second dive to a maximum
depth of 32m.  As he and his buddy descended the shotline to a
wreck they encountered a strong current.  16 min into the dive
the buddy signalled that he had 120 bar remaining and they
moved to a predetermined part of the wreck to start their
ascent.  The diver attached his delayed SMB to the wreck and
used his main regulator to inflate it.  While he did so he
breathed from his alternative air source.  His main regulator
then began to free flow and he was unable to stop it.  He was
unable to reach the cylinder valve to turn off this regulator.  He
started to panic and headed for the surface.  He switched to his
decompression gas, nitrox 40, and planned to complete
decompression stops.  However he was unable to control his
buoyancy and he was carried to the surface.  He was recovered
into the boat and placed on oxygen.  His buddy made a normal
ascent.  The Coastguard was alerted and the diver and his
buddy were airlifted to a recompression chamber.  The diver
received a 6 hour recompression treatment.
May 2004 04/208
Two divers were ascending from a dive to a maximum depth of
16m.  At 10m the regulator of one of the divers started to free
flow.  They made a fast ascent to the surface.  No subsequent
ill effects were experienced.
May 2004 04/207
A diver was involved in an advanced nitrox course and she was
conducting her last simulated decompression stop.  She lost
control of her buoyancy, became inverted, swallowed water and
rose rapidly to the surface.  She was panicked but otherwise
unhurt.
May 2004 04/184
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 22m using a
new drysuit.  He started his ascent with no decompression
requirement showing on his computer.  He lost control of his
buoyancy at 10m and made a fast ascent to the surface.  His
computer then showed a missed 2 min stop at 3m.  Once back
in the boat it was noted that he had a burst blood vessel in one
of his eyes.  He was placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was
alerted.  The diver was airlifted to a recompression facility
where he received precautionary recompression therapy.
May 2004 04/368
A diver conducted a dive to 21m for 46 min with a 3 min safety
stop at 6m.  After a surface interval of 2 hours 51 min he dived
to 15m for 44 min with a 3 min safety stop at 6m.  The following
day, after a surface interval of 19 hours 13 min, he dived to
25m.  After 20 min he deployed a delayed SMB.  Whilst doing
so the SMB line became tangled with his regulator and he was
dragged rapidly to the surface.  He was recovered into the boat
and placed on oxygen.  The Coastguard was alerted and the
boat returned to shore.  He was taken by ambulance to hospital.
He was given fluids and kept on oxygen for 4 hours.  He was X-
rayed for lung damage; none was found and no symptoms
developed.
May 2004 04/440
Dive support vessel contacted Solent Coastguard reporting
having a diver aboard having made a rapid ascent from 20m,
reported convulsing on ascent was using nitrox 58, incident
attributed to placing the wrong regulator in mouth on ascent (too
much oxygen) reached the surface in an unconscious condition,
casualty airlifted to recompression chamber by Coastguard
helicopter for treatment.  (Coastguard report).
May 2004 04/220
A pair of divers had conducted a dive to 52m with a 22 min
bottom time.  They were using trimix 18/33 as their diving gas
and nitrox 80 for decompression.  One of the pair was using a
new drysuit which she had only used twice in a pool and once
before in open water.  At their first stop one of the pair deployed
a delayed SMB, but whilst doing so he lost control of his
buoyancy and sank down.  The diver with the new drysuit then
started having problems with the buoyancy in her feet.  The
diver with the SMB sank down a little to allow her to use the
SMB line to steady herself.  The diver with the drysuit problems
reached 9m and switched to her decompression gas but her
buddy was so intent on helping with her buoyancy problems
that he forgot to switch.  She was not able to signal to him to
switch as she lost buoyancy control as soon as she let go of the
line.  Eventually the gas switch took place but both divers forgot
to enter their gas switch into their computers.  The diver with
buoyancy problems could not ascend above 9m without losing
control of her ascent.  After 30 min she was running low on
decompression gas and she sent an emergency delayed SMB
to the surface, a pre-arranged signal that they needed
additional decompression gas.  The boat manoeuvred
alongside their SMB and an additional 10l cylinder of nitrox 80
was lowered down to them.  Both divers moved to this cylinder
and the diver with the buoyancy problem switched over to it.
When she next looked at her buddy he was laying backwards in
the water with no regulator in his mouth and with his tongue
hanging out of this mouth.  She brought him to the surface and
called for assistance.  The boat manoeuvred to the divers and
two additional divers jumped in to help.  The diver that had lost
his regulator was unconscious.  He was recovered into the boat
and found not to be breathing.  The other diver was also
recovered.  Both had missed decompression stops.
Resuscitation techniques were applied to the non-breathing
diver and he was revived.  He was placed on oxygen and his
buddy was placed on nitrox.  The Coastguard was alerted and
the two divers were airlifted to a recompression facility.  Both
received recompression treatment and the diver who had been
unconscious was given anti-biotics and kept in hospital
overnight.  No symptoms were reported.
May 2004 04/209
A diver completed a 36 min dive to a depth of 10m with a 1 min
stop at 6m.  21 hours later he dived to 47m for 75 min including
a 2 min stop at 14m, a 3 min stop at 9m, a 5 min stop at 6m and
a 34 min stop at 3m.  17 hours 40 min later he dived to a
maximum depth of 34m for a total dive duration of 33 min.  At
the end of this last dive the diver's buddy deployed a delayed

NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2004
34 ©BSAC - 2004
SMB and they ascended to 6m where the buddy's computer
indicated that a 14 min stop was required.  However the diver
felt that his drysuit was very tight on his chest and that he could
not breathe.  He indicated to his buddy that he wanted to
ascend.  The buddy calmed him and the stop continued.  A little
later the buddy had to reassure the diver again and encourage
him to continue the stop.  Finally the diver was sufficiently
distressed that he rose to the surface before the decompression
stop was completed.  His buddy surfaced with him and found
him semi-conscious.  At the surface the diver spat out his
regulator and vomited.  The buddy towed him to the boat and
they were recovered from the water.  They had missed 10 min
of decompression.  Both were placed on oxygen and the
Coastguard was alerted.  They were airlifted to a recompression
facility where the diver was given a precautionary
recompression treatment.  The buddy did not have the recent
history of long decompression and was not treated.  No
symptoms were reported by either diver.
June 2004 04/369
A pair of divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 35m.
At a depth of 15m one of the pair deployed a delayed SMB to
make the ascent.  The reel jammed and the diver was dragged
upwards.  He abandoned the SMB and reel.  He attempted to
dump air from his BCD but probably, inadvertently, pressed the
inflator.  He made a rapid ascent to the surface.  He re-
descended to try to find his buddy and to complete his
decompression stops.  He did not find his buddy who surfaced
separately.  After finishing his stops he surfaced.  No
subsequent ill effects were experienced.
June 2004 04/192
A pair of divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 11m.
One of the pair swam over a kelp covered boulder at a depth of
9m.  He believes that the kelp became entangled with the right
hand side of his weight harness and a velcro pocket opened
releasing a 6 kg weight.  The diver was unable to prevent a
buoyant ascent to the surface.  His dive duration was 32 min.
He was recovered into the boat where he developed a
headache and nausea.  He was placed on oxygen initially for 10
min and then periodically as they returned to the shore.  Back
on shore the symptoms resolved and no further action was
taken.
June 2004 04/268
Two divers were exploring some wreckage at a depth of 20m.
Whilst inside the wreck one of the pair experienced suit
squeeze.  He operated the suit feed valve which stuck in the
open position and fell apart.  The buoyant diver was pinned
against the roof of the wreck.  He pushed himself out and then
made a rapid buoyant ascent to the surface where he arrived
with his drysuit fully inflated.  His only injury was a cut to his
head which he sustained on leaving the wreck.
June 2004 04/370
A diver conducted a dive to 17m for 30 min.  3 hours 10 min
later she dived to 18m.  During the ascent, at a depth of 10m,
her weightbelt came loose and fell away.  She was unable to
prevent a buoyant ascent to the surface.  Her buddy made a
normal ascent.  She was recovered into the boat and placed on
oxygen.  No subsequent ill effects were experienced.
June 2004 04/199
Brixham Coastguard received a call from a dive support vessel
requesting assistance for an unwell diver, experiencing
queasiness diver was administered oxygen and taken to
Plymouth by own boat being met by lifeboat and transferred to a
waiting ambulance which took the casualty to DDRC Derriford
hospital for treatment.  (Coastguard report).
June 2004 04/448
'Mayday' call received from dive support vessel indicating
having taken an unconscious diver from the water, it was noted
the diver's kit was hanging off, it transpired he had become
trapped on the wreck, having got free, the diver made a rapid
ascent to the surface.  Rescue helicopter R-WB airlifted
casualty to hospital and then on to recompression chamber for
treatment.  (Coastguard report).
June 2004 04/447
'Mayday' broadcast made by dive support boat with diver
aboard surfacing without buddy, buddy located having missed
stops, administered oxygen and refusing any assistance or
medical attention.  (Coastguard report).
June 2004 04/546
A pair of dives conducted a dive to a depth of 29m.  They made
a normal ascent to 8m at which point one of the pair lost control
of his buoyancy and was unable to prevent himself being
carried directly to the surface.  He was placed on oxygen for 30
min.  No symptoms developed and no further action was taken.
June 2004 04/270
Three divers conducted a dive to a depth of 36m.  At 30m one
of the three had a problem with his regulator.  One of his
buddies offered his pony regulator but the troubled diver had
swallowed some water and had difficulty breathing.  The other
diver gave him his octopus regulator and he managed to
breathe from this.  They made a fast ascent from 20m, missing
a 3 min safety stop at 3m.  One of the buddies was placed on
oxygen for 10 min.  No subsequent ill effects were experienced.
June 2004 04/229
Three divers conducted a dive to a depth of 30m.  Towards the
end of their dive they deployed a delayed SMB and ascended to
6m.  Their computers indicated between 8 and 9 min of stops
required.  One of the three was unable to control her buoyancy
and she rose to the surface.  She was recovered into the boat
and placed on oxygen.  The Coastguard was informed.  The
other two divers completed their stops and the boat returned to
the shore where they were met by the Coastguard and
paramedics.  The diver who had missed stops was taken to a
recompression facility where she received a precautionary 2
hour treatment.  No ill effects were experienced.  It was later
found that this diver's drysuit inflation valve continuously leaked
air into her drysuit.
July 2004 04/457
Dive boat reported to Stornoway Coastguard having a diver
aboard who had made a rapid ascent, diver refused any
medical assistance, said he was an instructor, taking oxygen
and water, hourly communications with the vessel until vessel in
port.  No further action taken.  (Coastguard report).
July 2004 04/286
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 43m.  After
18 min they deployed a delayed SMB and started their ascent.
They made a 2 min stop at 26m and then continued the ascent.
At 9m one of the pair lost control of her buoyancy and made a
fast ascent to the surface.  During the ascent she lost one of
her fins.  She was assisted into the boat and she asked for
oxygen.  The Coastguard was alerted and the diver was airlifted
to shore and then taken by ambulance to a recompression
facility where she received recompression treatment.  She
remained symptom-free throughout.

July 2004 04/304
A pair of divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 29m.
35 min into the dive, at a depth of 24m, one of the pair deployed
a delayed SMB.  It is thought that dive slates had fallen out of
his BCD pocket and that these became tangled in the
ascending SMB.  He made a rapid ascent from 24m to the
surface.  He disconnected himself from the buoy and re-
descended to meet his buddy at 9m.  His dive computer
indicated that 26 min of stops were required.  He decompressed
using the main cylinder of his buddy's rebreather which
contained nitrox 40.  After a total dive time of 67 min they
surfaced and were recovered into the boat.  The diver who had
made the rapid ascent was placed on oxygen and medical
advice was sought via the Coastguard.  The diver was airlifted
to a recompression facility.  Examination did not reveal any
problems and the diver was discharged.
July 2004 04/373
A pair of divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 32m.
After 30 min they ascended to 12m in about 3 min.  One diver
attempted to deploy an SMB but had a problem with the reel.
The other diver then deployed his delayed SMB, but whilst
doing so they sank back down to 15m.  One diver held the reel
and the other inflated it. By this time they were at 17m.  The
dive time was 39 min and their computers indicated a 10 min
ascent time.  They ascended to 3m but one of the pair was
unable to control his buoyancy and he rose to the surface.  His
dive duration was 42 min and he had missed 8 min of
decompression stops.  At the surface he was tangled in the
SMB line and he was unable to re-descend to join his buddy.
He was recovered into the boat and placed on oxygen.  His
buddy completed the stops and surfaced safely.  No symptoms
developed and no further action was taken.
July 2004 04/290
A pair of divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 45m.
After 25 min they started their ascent.  They conducted a 2 min
stop at 30m, a 2 min stop at 23m, a 1 min stop at 15m and a 2
min stop at 12m.  They planned to make a 5 min stop at 9m and
an 18 min stop at 6m using nitrox 75.  As they approached 9m
one of the pair lost control of his buoyancy and rose slowly to
the surface without switching to nitrox and without stops.  He
signalled to his buddy to complete his stops, which he did.  The
buoyant diver was recovered into the boat and placed on
oxygen.  The Coastguard was alerted and the diver was airlifted
to a recompression facility.  The diver experienced a mild
tingling in his feet whilst on the boat but medical examination
revealed no signs of DCI.  The diver undertook a precautionary
6 hour recompression treatment.
August 2004 04/307
A pair of divers conducted a dive to a depth of 33m.  They
prepared to deploy a delayed SMB and looked around for an
anchorage point for the reel.  At this point one of the pair had
105 bar and the other had 70 bar.  The diver with 70 bar had
the reel attached to her and her buddy was concerned that she
would inflate the buoy with the reel still attached so he
unclipped it and continued to seek an anchorage point. By this
time the diver who had had 70 bar now had only 30 bar.  Her
buddy passed her his pony regulator and they started their
ascent without an SMB.  At 20m the buddy experienced
difficulty breathing and indicated that he wanted to ascend.  He
put air into his BCD.  The other diver took hold of him and put
air in her BCD too.  They ascended from 20m to the surface in 1
min.  They were recovered into their boat and placed on
oxygen.  The Coastguard was alerted and the boat returned to
shore.  Paramedics met them and they were taken by
ambulance to hospital from where they were airlifted to a
recompression facility.  Both were given a precautionary
recompression treatment.
August 2004 04/281
Two divers were conducting a dive to a depth of 27m when one
of the pair developed cramp in both his legs.  He made a fast
ascent to the surface.  He felt tired and had a slight headache.
He was given oxygen and made a full recovery.
August 2004 04/469
Shetland Coastguard co-ordinated the transfer of a diver who
had made a rapid ascent from 40m to a waiting ambulance and
on to a hyperbaric chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard report).
August 2004 04/329
A pair of divers planned to dive on a wreck to a maximum depth
of 35m.  They descended the shotline and as they got deeper
one of the pair noticed that her air had an unusual taste.  This
got worse so she switched to her pony regulator.  The shotline
was off the wreck and they reached the bottom at 40m.  They
ascended to about 35m where they deployed a delayed SMB.
They made a slow ascent.  The diver who had been breathing
from her pony cylinder had to switch back to her main regulator
when the pony cylinder was depleted.  The other diver was
above her and, at about 15m, she started to have buoyancy
control problems.  The lower diver tried to get her to hold on to
the SMB line but she did not do so.  The buoyant diver became
inverted and was carried to the surface; her dive duration was
22 min. Her buddy made a normal ascent with a short stop at
6m.     Both were recovered into the boat.  The diver who had
made the buoyant ascent was placed on oxygen.  She felt sick
and the Coastguard was alerted.  The diver then complained of
'pins and needles' in her right hand.  Both divers were airlifted to
a recompression facility.  The tingling sensation was thought to
have been due to hyperventilation and no DCI was found.
However the diver had missed decompression stops and she
was given a precautionary recompression treatment.  Water
and oil were later found in the cylinder that had delivered the
bad-tasting air.
August 2004 04/308
A pair of divers planned a dive to a maximum depth of 18m.
They entered the water from a quay and swam, on the surface,
to a marker buoy.  They descended to 18m and settled on the
bottom.  They then followed the bottom down to a depth of 23m.
At this point they realised that they were deeper than intended.
At this depth the water was cold and one of the pair felt
uncomfortable.  They decided to abort the dive.  They ascended
to a depth of 9m at which point the diver who had been
uncomfortable on the bottom began to feel claustrophobic and
to hyperventilate.  His breathing rate rose dramatically and he
made a fast ascent to the surface.  His buddy was engulfed in a
mass of bubbles and decided to follow more slowly so that he
would be in a condition to assist at the surface.  At the surface
the buddy checked that the distressed diver was alright and
called for assistance.  The buddy quickly got out of the water,
dekitted and then returned to help the distressed diver from the
water.  He was placed on oxygen and the emergency services
were called.  Both divers were airlifted to a recompression
facility but the helicopter was unable to land there, so they were

NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2004
36 ©BSAC - 2004
taken to hospital.  Both were then taken by ambulance to the
recompression facility where they received a precautionary
treatment.  They were discharged later that night.
August 2004 04/360
A pair of divers conducted a dive to 50m.  During their ascent
they planned a 1 min stop at 21m.  One of the pair was able to
stop but the other had buoyancy control problems and could
not.  He ascended to 12m and was then able to fin back down
to 21m to rejoin his buddy.  He was breathing nitrox 26 and
during his swim back to 21m he switched to nitrox 50.  They
stayed at 21m for 3 min.  The diver with the buoyancy control
problem also had a problem with the attachment of his
decompression cylinder.  He needed to use his left hand to hold
the cylinder in place as it was pulling the regulator from his
mouth and causing his mask to flood.  He dumped the air from
his BCD but air was trapped in his drysuit and he struggled to
stay down.  He was becoming exhausted and decided to
surface as slowly as he could.  The diver had no symptoms of
DCI but was airlifted to a recompression facility where he
received a precautionary recompression treatment.

Diving support vessel contacted Humber Coastguard reporting
a diver aboard having made a rapid ascent from 12m following
a 49m trimix dive.  Diver airlifted to recompression chamber,
whilst in transit the RAF Rescue helicopter was tasked to
another pair of divers proceeding to Hull Hyperbaric chamber
for treatment.  (Coastguard report).
August 2004 04/316
An instructor and two trainees were engaged in an extended
range diving course.  The descended a shotline to a depth of
33m and one of the trainees laid out a distance line for about 8
min as they swam to a depth of 34m.  The other trainee then
took the reel to recover the line as they returned to the shotline.
He was in a head-down position and began to experience
buoyancy problems causing him to start to ascend.  The
instructor attempted to dump air from the trainee's BCD but
because he was on his side none of the dump valves was in the
right position to release air.  They rose rapidly.  At 10m the
instructor stopped and descended to complete his stops.  The
buoyant diver rose directly to the surface; he was recovered into
the boat and placed on oxygen.  The third diver returned to the
shotline and made a normal ascent.  Medical advice was
sought by phone and the diver was taken to a recompression
facility.  He experienced no symptoms but was given a
precautionary recompression treatment.
August 2004 04/330
Two divers were at a depth of 20m collecting scallops.  The
weightbelt of one of the pair suddenly became unfastened and
fell away.  He grabbed his buddy and they started to ascend.
His buddy's regulator was knocked from her mouth.  They
separated.  The buoyant diver was carried to the surface.  His
buddy sank down a little, replaced her regulator and then made
a normal ascent with a safety stop.  Both were recovered into
the boat and no ill effects were experienced.
August 2004 04/331
A pair of divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 35m.
One was diving with open circuit air and the other was using a
rebreather.  The air diver was carrying two dive computers.
When 20 min of decompression stops were showing on one
computer they started their ascent.  The diver then checked her
other computer and found that it was showing that 50 min of
stops were required.  Her buddy stayed with her for part of this
time and then, after experiencing buoyancy problems, he
ascended to the surface.  The lone diver completed a further 15
min of decompression and then surfaced.  Her total dive time
was 102 min of which 65 min was decompression stops.  No
subsequent problems were experienced.  It was thought that
the computers had not been correctly set before the dive.
September 2004 04/358
Three divers conducted a dive to 35m for a duration of 35 min
including a 2 min stop at 6m and a 4 min stop at 3m.  2 hours
30 min later they conducted a drift dive to collect scallops.
Their initial depth was 22m.  The seabed then rose to 15m and
they remained at this depth for 20 min.  The seabed then fell
away to 22m again and they re-descended.  After a while one of
the divers indicated that they had significant decompression
stops to conduct and that they should ascend.  They made a
controlled ascent to 6m and conducted a 2 min stop.  They then
ascended to 3m.  At this point one of the three ran out of air and
began to use the alternative air source of one of the other
divers.  In doing so they started to sink back down.  The third
diver followed them down to 10m and the diver who was
donating air then put a lot of air into his BCD.  They started to
ascend again and stopped at 3m.  Again they started to sink
and again the air donor put air into his BCD.  This time the
divers were carried to the surface.  One of their computers
indicated that a 7 min stop at 3m had been missed.  No further
action was reported.
September 2004 04/326
A pair of divers entered the water and descended the shotline of
another boat.  When they arrived at the bottom of the shot they
found two divers from this other boat.  One was trying to refit
the cylinder of the other but was unable to do so because the
clamping band had become completely disconnected.  A diver
from the first pair refitted the cylinder and after exchanging OK
signals they swam away.  Later the two divers who had had
problems with their cylinder lost control of their buoyancy and
made a rapid ascent.  A diver from the second party helped to
recover the rest of the divers and alerted the Coastguard that a
diver had made a rapid ascent and was on oxygen.
September 2004 04/503
Following a 40 min 45m dive a diver missed 15 min of stops.
Portland Coastguard requested rescue helicopter to transport
the diver to recompression chamber.  (Coastguard report).
September 2004 04/347
A pair of divers were at a depth of 20m when one of them
inadvertently pressed the inflator button on her drysuit and
started an uncontrolled ascent.  She was unable to dump air to
stop the ascent.  During the ascent she ditched her weightbelt.
Her dive duration was 12 min.  No subsequent ill effects were

experienced.
September 2004 04/335
Three divers conducted a dive to 15m.  They deployed a
delayed SMB to make their ascent.  The least experienced diver
was placed close to the SMB line and they exchanged 'go up'
signals.  At this point the inexperienced diver made a rapid
ascent directly to the surface.  His dive duration was 18 min.
The other two ascended at a normal rate.  Once out of the
water the diver who had made the rapid ascent was unaware
that there was a problem.  About 20 min later he complained of
visual problems and a ringing in one ear.  Medical advice was
sought by phone.  DCI was not thought possible.  The
symptoms resolved after 20 min and no further action was
taken.

Technique
October 2003 04/015
Two trainee divers were instructed to follow a line placed along
an under water ledge at a depth of 6m.  They failed to follow the
line and instead followed the rock face down to a depth of 15m.
At this depth one of the pair began to panic and spat out his
regulator.  His buddy put it back but he spat it out again and went
for the buddy's regulator.  The buddy offered his alternative air
source but the panicked diver would not take it.  The buddy then
tried to get them both back to the surface.  At this point their
instructor reached them and inflated the panicked diver's BCD
and he ascended without his regulator in place.  At the surface
the alarm was raised and the divers were recovered from the
water.  The panicked diver was not breathing and did not appear
to have a pulse.  Resuscitation was started and defibrillator pads
were placed on the casualty.  A faint heartbeat was detected and
as oxygen was given he started to improve.  The casualty was
airlifted to a recompression chamber.  He was given
recompression treatment and released the following day.  The
casualty had completed a dive to 20m earlier in the day of the
incident.
October 2003 04/062
Two divers practiced a controlled buoyant lift from 20m to 10m.
At this point one of the divers gave the 'out of air' signal and took
her buddy's alternative air source.  However she put the
regulator into her mouth upside down and breathed in water.
She began to panic.  Her buddy took hold of her and tried to turn
the regulator the right way round, but without success.  He tried
to find the troubled diver's own alternative air source but was
unable to make this available.  The panicked diver bolted to the
surface.  At the surface blood was seen to be coming from her
mouth.  It was later found to be due to a cut lip.  She was
removed from the water, placed on oxygen and taken to a
hospital from where she was discharged later that day.
October 2003 04/028
An instructor and two other divers conducted a training dive to
practice controlled buoyant lifts.  They dived to 20m and started
the first lift.  As the diver being lifted started to ascend he moved
higher than the lifting diver.  The lifting diver's right arm stretched
upwards and in doing so pushed his regulator upwards.  The
regulator had a soft mouthpiece and, although it was not lost
from the diver's mouth, the airflow was impeded and the seal
broken.  When the diver attempted to breathe in he got a
mouthful of water.  He thought that the regulator had a problem
and so he discarded it and gave the 'out of air' signal.  His
buddy's alternative air source was secured by a clip and this took
some time to release.  The troubled diver took the buddy's
alternative air source and was unable to exhale to purge the
regulator so he swallowed the air/water mixture in his mouth and
started to breathe.  He struggled to control his breathing and
signaled that he wanted to ascend.  His buddy pressed the
inflation button on his BCD and the direct feed hose connection
parted.  The buddy started to inflate the troubled diver's drysuit
and it took some time for the ascent to start.  Assisted by the
instructor they made it safely to the surface.  At the surface the
troubled diver briefly lost consciousness.  He was recovered to
the shore by the other two.  The diver was placed on oxygen and
taken to hospital.  He suffered stomach pains from the expansion
of the air that he had swallowed.  He was released from hospital
later that day.
December 2003 04/042
Two divers conducted a shore dive.  After around 25 min they
surfaced approximately a half a kilometer from the shore.  Other
divers on the shore, who were not part of the same group,
watched them and noticed that they did not seem to be moving.
After 15min they had still not changed position and the divers on
the shore signalled them to see if they were in difficulties; they
did not get a clear response.  A Coastguard official arrived at the
scene and after some discussion summoned a helicopter to
recover the divers.  The divers refused help from the helicopter
and were eventually recovered to the shore by a small fishing
boat which was launched to help them.  It is believed that one of
the divers had lost a fin.
April 2004 04/181
Three divers completed a wreck dive to a maximum depth of
28m.  One diver used air for the dive and nitrox 50 for his
decompression.  The second used nitrox 28 and the third used
nitrox 30 throughout.  They deployed a delayed SMB to make
their ascent.  The two divers using nitrox as their dive gas
conducted a 5 min 30 sec stop at 10m and a 5 min 30 sec stop
at 5m and then surfaced.  The diver who had dived on air
conducted a 4 min stop at 6m and an 18 min stop at 3m.  Signals
were exchanged during the decompression but these were mis-
understood resulting in the diver who had been using air as his
dive gas completing his decompression alone.  For a while this
diver's location was not known by those at the surface but he
deployed his own delayed SMB.  A diver from another party was
asked to descend to check that he was alright and he waited with
him until he surfaced safely.
April 2004 04/135
Two divers had dived to a maximum depth of 21m.  At 17m one
of the pair ran out of air.  He used his buddy's alternative air
source and they made a normal ascent to the surface.
April 2004 04/136
Two divers were near the end of a dive to a maximum depth of
14m.  One of the pair prepared to deploy a delayed SMB.  She
wore her octopus regulator on a cord around her neck and thus
chose to switch to this regulator so that she could use the longer
reach of her main regulator to inflate the buoy.  When she made
the switch she did not get the octopus regulator into her mouth
correctly and she inhaled some water.  She attempted to switch
back but again inhaled water and began to cough.  Her buddy,
who was on his first sea dive, took hold of her and put air into
her drysuit.  They made a rapid ascent to the surface. Their dive
duration was 30 min.   Neither diver suffered subsequent ill
effects.
April 2004 04/143
Two divers dived to 19m for 42 min.  2 hours later they started a
second dive.  As they moved down an underwater cliff face, at a
depth of 14m, one of the divers experienced flooding of his
mask.  He started to panic.  His buddy saw that there was a
problem and that the panicked diver did not have his regulator in
his mouth.  The buddy brought the panicked diver to the surface
and raised the alarm.  The divers were recovered into a boat.
The casualty had stopped breathing.  Oxygen-assisted
resuscitation techniques were applied and the emergency
services called.  The casualty recovered consciousness and was
taken to hospital by ambulance.

April 2004 04/202
A trainee diver was over-weighted.  At the surface, at the
beginning of a dive, his octopus regulator started to free flow.
He was unable to control his buoyancy and position, he became
inverted and started to panic.  An observer at the surface
shouted for help and ran to get assistance.  The observer fell up
some steps and cut her head.  Both diver and injured observer
recovered.
May 2004 04/203
A trainee diver completed a 30 min dive to 8m.  Once back at the
surface he did not inflate his BCD and started to panic.  He
swallowed water, started to hyperventilate and came close to
losing consciousness.  He was recovered from the water and
placed on oxygen.  He made a quick recovery.
June 2004 04/272
An instructor and a trainee conducted a dive to a maximum
depth of 14m.  They started the dive exploring a wreck and the
instructor then deployed a delayed SMB so that they could finish
with a drift dive.  During the drift dive the trainee finned into the
current for a while to look at a crab.  The instructor was unable to
remain with him because of the drag on the SMB.  They became
separated.  Both divers surfaced safely and they were recovered
into their boat.
July 2004 04/374
A pair of divers were ascending from a dive to 20m.  At 15m the
hood of one of the divers filled with air.  This dislodged her mask
and knocked the regulator from her mouth.  At the surface her
buddy raised the alarm and they were recovered from the water.
The diver was taken by helicopter to a recompression facility.
No symptoms were present but the diver was given a
precautionary recompression treatment.  She was placed on
antibiotics for ten days because she had swallowed water.
September 2004 04/348
A trainee diver was engaged in mask clearing drills in a depth of
9m.  He removed his mask but then had difficulty replacing it.
The drill was terminated and the trainee was helped to the
surface via a shotline.  He was having difficulty breathing and he
was coughing.  He experienced pain in his diaphragm and
difficulty breathing out.  He was placed on oxygen and medical
advice was sought.  He went to hospital but no problems were
found.  It is thought that he had ingested air causing stomach
pains.

Equipment
January 2004 04/068
A pair of divers began a dive to a maximum depth of 20m.  After
about 2 min the regulator of one of the pair began to free flow.
He switched regulators and attempted to stop the free flow, but
could not.  With his air supply at 100 bar he switched to his
pony regulator and his buddy turned off his main cylinder.  They
then made a normal ascent including a 1 min safety stop at 6m.
Their total dive duration was 9 min.
January 2004 04/073
Two divers were 3 min into a dive at a depth of 19m.  At this
point the regulator of one of the pair began to free flow.  He took
his buddy's alternative air source and the buddy then turned off
his main air supply.  However when it was turned back on the
regulator continued to free flow.  The buddy turned the air off
again and they ascended to 6m where they conducted a 3 min
safety stop.  During this stop the air was turned back on again
and this time the regulator functioned correctly.  The diver
switched back to his own regulator and they completed the dive
safely.  Their total dive duration was 12 min.  No subsequent ill
effects were experienced.
January 2004 04/144
Two divers dived to a depth of 21m.  11 min into the dive the
regulator of one of the pair began to free flow.  The pair settled
onto the bottom and decided that the diver with the free flow
would surface using his pony regulator.  At around 15m he lost
control of his buoyancy and ascended rapidly to 4m.  He
dumped air and sank back to 8m where he rejoined his buddy.
By this time the diver's main cylinder was empty and he was not
able to put air into his BCD or drysuit.  He had to fin hard to
ascend and he made a fairly rapid ascent to the surface.  At the
surface he orally inflated his BCD.  No subsequent ill effects
were experienced.
January 2004 04/094
Two divers were at a depth of 17m.  One of the pair had 140 bar
remaining in a 15l cylinder and he  turned the contents gauge to
show his buddy.  This action caused the gauge to become
detached from the hose and the gauge was lost.  The dive
leader provided him with an alternative air source and they
made an ascent at a normal rate to the surface.  At the surface
the diver with the lost gauge was still able to inflate his BCD.
Their dive duration was 28 min.  No subsequent ill effects were
reported.
February 2004 04/098
An instructor and two trainees were at a depth of 14m
conducting a lifting bag training exercise.  About 10 min into the
dive the instructor was demonstrating how to fill the bag with his
octopus regulator when it began to free flow.  He was unable to
stop the free flow and he ascended to the surface with the two
students.  At the surface he had 20 bar remaining.  The water
temperature was 10 deg C.  No subsequent ill effects were
reported.
February 2004 04/099
A diver was practicing the mid-water deployment of a delayed
SMB using his octopus regulator.  The regulator began to free
flow and he was unable to stop it.  The instructor passed his
alternative air source to the student and then turned student's
air supply off and then on again in an attempt to stop the free
flow.  This did not work so he turned the air supply off again.
They then made a safe ascent to the surface.  Their total dive
time was 13 min.  The water temperature was 10 deg C.   It was
thought that sand may have entered the regulator and
contributed to the problem.   No subsequent ill effects were
reported.
February 2004 04/102
Two divers had dived to a maximum depth of 25m.  At 22m one
of the pair breathed in a mouthful of water and discovered that
the mouthpiece had separated from his regulator.  He switched
to his alternative air source and they made a safe ascent to the
surface including a 2 min safety stop at 6m.
March 2004 04/127
A pair of divers dived to a maximum depth of 35m.  At 25m one
of the divers' regulators began to free flow.  This diver used his
buddy's alternative air source and they made an ascent at a
normal rate.  Their dive duration was 20 min.  At the surface the
diver with the free flow was a little disorientated but no
subsequent ill effects were experienced.
March 2004 04/128
Two divers were at a depth of 35m when one of the pair's
regulators began to free flow.  He switched to his pony regulator
and made an ascent missing a planned safety stop.  His dive
duration was 6 min.  He was given oxygen as a precaution.
April 2004 04/147
Two divers conducted a dive on a wreck.  Towards the end of
the dive, one of the pair secured a reel to the wreck and inflated
a delayed SMB using his octopus regulator.  The regulator
began to free flow and he was not able to stop it.  He realised
that he had drifted above his buddy and out of her sight so he
ascended to the surface.  His buddy made a normal ascent with
the SMB.  The diver with the free flow was seen to arrive at the
surface in a cloud of bubbles.  He was recovered into the boat
and placed on oxygen.  Medical advice was sought.  The diver
was monitored but no ill effects developed and no further action
was taken.
June 2004 04/221
Two divers conducted a wreck dive to a depth of 20m.  Towards
the end of the dive, one of the pair indicated that she had 70 bar
remaining and they made their way to a shallower part of the
wreck.  The dive leader prepared a delayed SMB.  He inflated it
with his octopus regulator.  The regulator began to free flow.
The free flow was so powerful that it jetted off out of his reach.
The SMB began to ascend and pulled on the reel.  The diver
released the reel lock but the handle tangled on the reel
lanyard.  The diver was impeded by a camera that he was
carrying and the mass of bubbles.  He managed to free the reel
and sent the SMB to the surface.  He signalled to his buddy and
switched to her alternative air source.  They started their ascent
but were unable to prevent themselves being carried directly to
the surface, although the ascent was not rapid.  At the surface
they signalled for assistance and were recovered into the boat.
Both were placed on oxygen but neither suffered any
symptoms.  It was later found that the regulator design meant
that the purge button was susceptible to being jammed by sand.

A diver completed a 28 min dive to a maximum depth of 22m
using a regulator that had just been serviced.  Once back on
shore he rinsed his regulator with fresh water and left it to dry.
The following day he assembled it to a cylinder in preparation to
dive when he heard an air leak.  He move the hoses and the
second stage regulator fell off the hose.  A new hose had been
fitted during the service and the regulator had not been securely
fastened to it.  The diver refitted the regulator correctly and had
no further problems.
June 2004 04/235
A trainee diver was being taught a forward roll entry into a
swimming pool.  When he attempted the entry he did not
conduct it correctly and his face mask struck the water flat.  The
glass shattered.  The diver was not injured.  Other divers
recovered the broken glass and the pool was further cleaned
with vacuum equipment.
June 2004 04/241
When kitting up to dive, a group of divers noticed that the air in
their diving cylinders smelled and tasted contaminated.  They
aborted their dive and contacted the air supplier. It was
established that excessive compressor oil was in the air and it
was deemed necessary to have all the cylinders involved
cleaned.
June 2004 04/371
Three divers conducted a dive to a depth of 18m.  As they
descended one of the pair felt a little cold and underwater he
had problems with buoyancy control.  Their dive time was 25
min and they made a 3 min stop at 6m.  At the surface the diver
who had had buoyancy control problems struggled to stay at the
surface and became exhausted during a swim back to the boat.
His two buddies helped him to get back to the boat.  Others
helped him from the water.  Once in the boat it was discovered
that his drysuit contained a large amount of water.  It was
thought that his zip had not been correctly closed at the start of
the dive.
June 2004 04/196
A diver was preparing for a dive.  She was using a regulator
that had just been serviced.  As she kitted up air was heard
leaking from her equipment.  She took the set off and as she
did so the second stage regulator fell away.  It was discovered
that the regulator had not been securely tightened to the feed
hose during the service.  The regulator was correctly refitted
and no further problems were experienced.
August 2004 04/319
A compressor operator conducted an internal inspection of a
diving cylinder prior to filling it with oxygen and then air to
generate nitrox 36.  He discovered that the cylinder was rusted
heavily internally.  The cylinder was considered to be dangerous
and it was later condemned.  A few weeks earlier the cylinder
had been completely emptied whilst it was underwater.  Water
had entered the regulator and it required a service as a result.
It is thought that water also entered the cylinder thus generating
the rust.
September 2004 04/327
A diver dived to a maximum depth of 18m.  At 15m the
connector of his regulator hose failed and became
disconnected.  He inhaled some water.  He made a rapid
ascent without an air supply.  His total dive time was 30 min.
He was placed on oxygen and then on nitrox 70 when the
oxygen was depleted, and he was given fluids to drink.  No
subsequent ill effects were experienced.  It is reported that the
hose to his BCD was severely perished and that he had had a
high pressure hose fail the previous day.

Two divers conducted a dive from the shore.  Their dive plan
took them around a small island.  They swam too close to the
island and, in a depth of 6m, began to be affected by wave
surge.  They were pushed into a blind gulley on the island and
the surge became stronger.  They attempted to swim away but
were forced onto rocks.  One of the pair ditched her weights in
an attempt to get out of the water on the rocks but she was
swept back into the water.  They attempted to attract the
attention of people on a nearby headland but there was no
apparent response.  They managed to get into deeper water and
swam back to the shore on the surface.  After about 5 min an

A trainee and an instructor were engaged in an advanced diving
course.  At a depth of 30m the trainee had a panic attack and the
instructor brought her to the surface.  Their dive time was 12
min.  At the surface the panic attack continued, she was given
oxygen and an ambulance was called.  Eventually the diver
recovered and no further action was required.

Overseas Incidents
Fatalities
August 2004 04/297
A group of divers were approached by a police launch.  They
were informed that a snorkel diver was missing and they were
asked to assist.  They travelled at high speed to the site and
two pairs of divers were deployed to search.  Within two min of
diving one pair located the missing snorkel diver lying on his
back on a rock at a depth of 15m.  They removed his weightbelt
and brought him to the surface.  One of the pair applied AV to
the casualty, at the surface, until he was recovered into the
police launch.  The casualty was taken rapidly to hospital and
after 90 min of resuscitation his heartbeat was restored and he
was placed on a ventilator.  He died two days later.
Decompression Illness
October 2003 04/030
On the fourth day of a diving expedition a diver completed a
series of four dives. Dive one was not specified but after a 2
hour 9 min surface interval he dived to  27m for 54 min with a
10 min stop at 6m, 2 hours 9 min later to 29m for 53 min with a
10 min stop at 6m and then, 1 hour 53 min later, to 27m for 42
min with a  2 min stop at 9m and a 10 min stop at 6m.  After
dive three he lifted his diving equipment back into the boat and
thought that he pulled a muscle in his shoulder.  Later that day
the pain in his left shoulder was still present, and there was
numbness and a skin rash on the shoulder.  He was placed on
oxygen and medical advice was sought.  He was taken to a
recompression facility where he was treated for DCI.
October 2003 04/031
A diver completed a 41 min dive to 27m with a 2 min stop at
3m.  1 hour 41 min later she dived again, this time to 26m for 45
min with a 6 min stop at 6m.  30 min after surfacing from the
second dive she complained of stomach pain and then
collapsed.  She was placed on oxygen and remained semi-
conscious.  The boat returned to the shore and the casualty
was taken to hospital.  From hospital she was taken to a
recompression facility for treatment.  She suffered total
blindness throughout the 24 hours following the dive.  She was
discharged from hospital, fully recovered, two days later.  The
diver reported, as potentially contributing factors,  that she had
been under emotional stress in the weeks leading to the dive,
that she had not been on a regular diet and that she had started
her menstrual cycle on the day of the dive.
June 2004 04/258
A diver completed a 40 min dive to a maximum depth of 32m
with a 3 min stop at 6m.  1 hour 40 min later he dived to 26m for
34 min with a 3 min stop at 6m.  30 min after his second dive he
suffered a severe headache and he felt dizzy and faint.  He had
a rash on his back.  He was placed on oxygen but lost
consciousness when the oxygen ran out.  He was given more
oxygen and a doctor was called.  Dehydration was diagnosed
and he was given further oxygen and placed on a fluid drip.  24
hours later he had not improved.  He was then given a 6 hour
recompression treatment.  15 min after leaving the chamber he
suffered a fit.  He was taken to hospital and placed on oxygen
and a fluid drip.  Four days later he returned to the UK and
attended a recompression facility where further sessions of
recompression therapy were given.  DCI was diagnosed and
dehydration, a long flight, lack of sleep and alcohol were
thought to have been contributory factors.  Treatment was
continuing at the time of the report.
July 2004 04/284
A diver completed a series of dives over a ten-day period.  On
the tenth day he dived to 28m for 41 min, then after a 4 hour 33
min interval, he dived to 28m for 42 min.  1 hour after surfacing
he developed a ‘blotchy bruise’ on his stomach.  This marking
grew over the next 30 min.  He was placed on oxygen and the
boat started a 4 hour trip to shore.  The casualty was taken to a
recompression facility where he received three sessions of
treatment.  After this treatment the casualty was symptom-free.
The casualty had had a previous DCI, four years earlier.
August 2004 04/340
A diver completed a 35 min dive to a depth of 30m.  He dived
using nitrox 30 with nitrox 50 for decompression.  During his
ascent he conducted a 2 min stop at 18m, a 2 min stop at 12m
and a 3 min stop at 6m.  Once back on the boat the diver
became very dizzy, had significant balance problems and was
vomiting.  He was placed on oxygen and the emergency
services were alerted.  The diver was airlifted to a
recompression facility.  Examination revealed that he had
nystagmus.  He was given a series of seven recompression
treatments over a four day period by which time the symptoms
had almost disappeared.  He was released from hospital on the
fourth day.  A DCI in the inner ear was diagnosed.  The diver
was advised to seek examination for a PFO.
September 2004 04/318
A diver conducted a dive to 12m and after a surface interval of
3 hour he dived to 10m.  The duration of each dive was 30 min.
Afterwards he stated that he had had difficulty clearing his ears
and he was advised to take decongestant medication.  The
following day he dived to 15m for 30 min with a 3 min stop at
6m.  Again he experienced difficulty clearing his ears.  The
following day he dived to 22m for 35 min with a 3 min stop at
6m.  After this dive he had a mild ear and sinus pain.  The
following day the pain remained and he sought medical advice.
A neurological DCI was diagnosed and he was given
recompression treatment.  This resolved his symptoms and he
was discharged from hospital the following day.  It was thought
that he had sustained a minor barotrauma on the first day and
that the subsequent dives had worsened the condition.
Illness / Injury
October 2003 04/019
A diver was preparing to enter the water.  Standing on a
pontoon he attempted to fit his left fin.  His right knee gave way,
he slipped on the wet surface and fell heavily onto his right
knee joint.  This fall caused minor pain to his knee.  He
completed a 40 min dive to 35m with a precautionary 3 min stop
at 6m.  On surfacing he still had a pain in his knee and the
following day he sought medical advice.  The diagnosis was an
aggravation of the lateral ligament of the knee and he was
advised to rest the knee for a week.

November 2003 04/063
A group of divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of
20m.  They were briefed that they might encounter strong
currents and to surface at a pre-arranged point to be recovered
into two inflatable boats.  They surfaced at the designated point
but the boats were not there. They signalled to and the boats
were dispatched to collect them.  By the time the boats arrived
they were caught in a current and swept toward shallow water
over a reef.  The boats were unable to pick them up from the
shallow water.  Two divers hung onto on of the boats as it tried
to pull them into deeper water but they were in danger from the
propeller and the attempt was abandoned.  The divers were
carried across the top of the reef at high speed and dropped
into calm water at the other side, where the boats were able to
recover them.  The divers received a number of cuts to hands
and legs from the coral of the reef and one diver lost a fin.
February 2004 04/097
A trainee diver completed a 34 min dive to a maximum depth of
18m.  At the start of the dive he conducted a training drill which
involved an ascent to the surface from 5m using an alternative
air source. 1 hour after the dive he complained of pains in his
left elbow.  He was placed on oxygen.  It was noted that his left
arm was weaker than his right.  He was taken to a medical
facility and kept on oxygen for a further 1 hour.
March 2004 04/113
A diver conducted a dive to 34m for 38 min with a 4 min safety
stop at 6m.  2 hours 55 min later he dived to 31m for 37 min
with a 4 min safety stop at 6m.  After the dive the diver reported
a pain in his shoulder.  He was given a medical examination
and strained muscle was diagnosed.  Later that day the diver
felt a 'click' in his shoulder and the symptoms resolved.
April 2004 04/170
Three divers dived to a maximum depth of 30m.  20 min into the
dive at a depth of 20m, one of the three signalled that he was
unwell and retched a number of times.  The dive leader took
hold of him while he regained composure.  They then ascended
slowly.  The troubled diver indicated that he was all right but
then that he was unhappy.  The dive leader decided to abort the
dive.  They made a normal ascent.  Once back in the boat the
troubled diver complained of a headache and of feeling
nauseous.  He vomited an number of times.  Medical advice
was sought and carbon dioxide build-up in the diver's regulator
was suspected.  He dived the next day using different
equipment without a problem.  The following day he dived again
with different equipment but again had problems, retching
underwater and vomiting in the boat after the dive.  It was
concluded that the dive equipment was not at fault and further
medical advice was being sought.
May 2004 04/174
Two RHIBs were moored together alongside a jetty.  The sea
state became rough and a cox boarded the boats to move the
outer one to prevent them from damaging each other.  In the
process of unclipping the boats a large wave struck them and
the cox's hand was trapped between the 'A' frame of one of the
boats and the bow of the other.  His hand began to swell.  The
casualty sought medical advice and severe bruising was
diagnosed.
August 2004 04/317
A diver conducted a series of ten dives over a five day period.
On the final day he dived to 28m for a duration of 50 min
including a 2 min stop at 6m.  10 hours after this dive he started
to get pains in his left shoulder and elbow.  He was placed on
oxygen and medical advice was sought.  He went to hospital
and was kept on oxygen and placed on a drip.  He was then
flown by plane to a recompression chamber where he received
treatment.  His symptoms did not change.  Further medical tests
were conducted and it was concluded that the diver had not
suffered a DCI.
September 2004 04/349
A diver was diving on a wreck to a maximum depth of 35m.  At
a depth of 26m he entered the wreck and in doing so he
brushed his hand against a sharp edge of the wreck.  One of his
fingers was cut to the bone.  He completed the dive.  Later he
attended hospital where the cut was treated.
Ascents
October 2003 04/012
Two divers conducted a 15 min dive to a depth of 14m.  They
made a fast ascent to the surface and as a result were placed
on oxygen and returned quickly to the shore.  One of the divers
reported 'pins and needles' in his right hand but this was
thought to be due to tight gloves which were removed.  The
emergency services were alerted and the divers were taken by
ambulance to hospital from where they were later released.  No
subsequent ill effects were reported.
March 2004 04/114
A pair of divers dived to 23m.  During their ascent, one of the
pair was unable to control the buoyancy of his drysuit and he
made a rapid ascent.  His buddy made a normal ascent.  The
diver who had made the rapid ascent was placed on oxygen.
The emergency services were alerted and the diver was taken
ashore.  He was then taken by ambulance to hospital.  The
diver had no symptoms and was released from hospital later
that day.  It is thought that the undersuit blocked the drysuit
dump valve.
May 2004 04/175
Two divers made a descent to a wreck at a depth of 20m.  One
diver then experienced a problem with her regulator and took
the other diver's octopus regulator.  The octopus regulator was
then knocked from her mouth so she used her own pony
regulator.  The divers started to return to the mooring line but
the diver with the regulator problem also experienced buoyancy
problems as a result of the valve malfunction.  Her main
regulator then began to free flow, adding to the confusion.  The
buddy decided to bring them both to the surface and a very
rapid ascent was made.  They moved from 20m to the surface
in less than 30 seconds.  Their dive duration was 8 min.  Both
divers were recovered from the water and placed on oxygen.
Diving medical advice was sought.  No symptoms of DCI were
experienced and no further action was taken.
Technique
June 2004 04/195
A pair of divers were diving on a wreck to a maximum depth of
32m.  One of the pair entered an enclosed area of the wreck.
The floor appeared un-silted and he checked behind him on two
occasions to make sure that he was not stirring up silt.  He took
several pictures and when he turned round to leave, he was
confronted with low visibility and he could not see the exit.  He
felt around the walls but could not find the way out.  He found a
port hole but was unable to attract the attention of those

NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2004

outside.  He waited for a few min for the silt to settle but realised
that it was his bubbles disturbing rust from the ceiling.  He tried
again to find the exit but failed.  He then saw the beam of a
torch.  His buddy had obtained a torch from other divers and
was indicating the exit.  His exit was blocked by a large piece of
machinery.  Eventually he got round this and managed to exit
the wreck.  On exit he lost a fin which fell back inside and was
not recovered.  They were now at 20m.  The diver took more
photographs and then got to the shotline where they made their
ascent.  They conducted a safety stop at 6m and left the water.
The diver who had been trapped in the wreck had 20 bar
remaining at the end of the dive.
Equipment
February 2004 04/095
A group of divers were at a depth of 23m when the pillar valve
O ring of one of the group suddenly failed.  The contents of her
cylinder were lost in about 90 sec.  She moved to her buddy
and took his alternative air source.  These two and another
diver then made a safe ascent to the surface.  No subsequent ill
effects were experienced.
April 2004 04/157
Two divers were diving using rebreathers.  After about 20 min,
at their maximum depth of 43m,  one of the divers noticed a gas
leak from the pressure gauge of the rebreather of the other
diver.  The pressure gauge read between 25 and 35 bar and
they were required to conduct decompression stops.  The
divers immediately started their ascent.  A 2 min stop was
conducted at each of 24m, 15m and 9m.  The rebreather with
the leak was fitted with a separate 1.5l oxygen cylinder and at
6m the main 10l cylinder was switched off and the rebreather
was operated manually as an oxygen rebreather.  It was
subsequently found that the high pressure hose had burst and
the escaping gas caused the gauge to read low; the pressure in
the cylinder was found to be 110 bar.  Neither diver suffered
any ill effects.
April 2004 04/225
A group of divers were diving from a charter vessel.  Whilst the
divers were in the water the charter vessel began to drag its
anchor.  The skipper attempted to relay the anchor but
experienced difficulties with the anchor winch.  The skipper
refused requests to launch a tender to cover the divers.  The
first group of four divers surfaced and were able to swim to the
boat. The second group of four surfaced further away and
struggled to swim to the boat against a surface current.  One of
this group was low on air and used a buddy's alternative air
source for the surface swim.  This diver also struggled to stay
positively buoyant.  Three snorkel divers were sent from the
boat with lifelines to assist the second group.  These snorkel
divers were unable to orally inflate the troubled diver's BCD.  All
were safely recovered into the boat and it was found that the
troubled diver's BCD had a loose dump valve which allowed the
air to escape.
