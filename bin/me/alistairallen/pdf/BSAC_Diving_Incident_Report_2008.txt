Introduction 
 
This booklet contains the 2008 Diving Incidents Report, produced by The British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC) in the 
interest of promoting diving safety.  It is important to note that it contains details of UK sports diving incidents 
occurring to divers of all affiliations, plus incidents occurring worldwide involving BSAC members.  
 
Report Format 
The majority of statistical information contained within this report is also shown in graphical form.  Please note that all 
statistical information is produced from UK data only and does not include Overseas Incidents unless noted as ‘All 
Incidents’. 
 
The contents of this report are split into an overview of the year, and then the details of nine incident categories plus some 
historical analyses.  The various sections can be found as shown below:- 
 
 i) Overview Page  1 
 ii) Fatalities Page 5 
 iii) Decompression Incidents Page  8 
 iv) Injury / illness Page  20 
 v) Boating & Surface Incidents Page  25 
 vi) Ascent Incidents Page  29 
 vii) Technique Incidents Page  35 
 viii) Equipment Incidents Page  36 
 ix) Miscellaneous Incidents Page  38 
 x) Overseas Incidents Page  40 
 xi) Numerical & Statistical Analyses Page  44 
 xii) List of Abbreviations Page  46 
 
 
Within each category the incidents are listed in the order of their occurrence, not necessarily that of Incident Reference.  
They are laid out in the following form: 
 
  MONTH/YEAR OF INCIDENT  INCIDENT REF.    
  Brief Narrative of Incident.................................................................................... 
  ........................................................................................................ 
 
The nature of many diving incidents is such that there is usually more than one cause or effect.  Where this is the case the 
incident has been classified under the more appropriate cause or effect. For instance an incident involving a fast ascent, 
causing decompression illness, will be classified under 'Decompression Incidents'.

Overview 
 
has seen a levelling out of the number of 
incidents reported in the UK with a total of 359 
being reported.  The chart below shows the total 
of UK incidents reported annually over the last 18 years and it 
can be seen that after a doubling during the 90s, there was a 
levelling out from 2000 onwards to an average of about 400 
incidents per year.  The last three years have been below this 
figure but it seems probable that the number is currently 
stabilising at a little below 400, making 2008 slightly below the 
current norm.

The distribution of reported incidents by month is shown in the 
following chart and although it largely conforms with the 
expected pattern there are some abnormalities.  March, April 
and June are somewhat below previous years and May is the 
highest number for over seven years.  The nature of the 
incidents in May is totally in line with the nature of the incidents 
across the year as an average, so there is no suggestion that a 
particular problem caused this peak.  More probably these 
variations will have been as a result of the prevailing weather 
conditions.     
As can be seen, 72% of these incidents have occurred in the 
summer period.  This is slightly higher than the norm of 67%.

Incidents by category 
The incident database assigns all incidents into one of nine 
major categories, and the following chart shows the distribution 
of the 2008 incidents into those categories.  
 
Last year, for the first time, the number of ‘Ascent’ related 
incidents overtook the number of ‘Decompression illness (DCI)’ 
related incidents; this year sees a return to the previous 
situation with ‘DCI’ once again being the largest category of 
incidents with a total of 125 events involving one or more 
individuals with DCI.  
  
Since a peak of 144 DCI incidents in 2002 the pattern had been 
one of a declining trend, each year being lower than the last 
with only 81 incidents reported in 2007; this year that number 
has increased by over 50%. 
 
On the other hand the number of cases of ‘Ascent’ problems 
has seen a steady climb over the previous 11 years.  As a result 
of this disturbing trend BSAC has been running a campaign 
encouraging divers to pay much more attention to buoyancy 
and ascent skills.  It is good to see that the number of ‘Ascent’ 
related incidents has fallen by over 30% from its peak in 2006.  
Typically these incidents involve a rapid ascent, often with 
missed decompression stops.  However, if such an ascent were 
to have resulted in a DCI then it would have been recorded in 
the more serious ‘DCI’ category. 
 
More detail on ‘DCI’, ‘Ascent’ and ‘Boat / Surface’ incidents can 
be found later in this overview together with an analysis of the 
most serious category;  the ‘Fatalities’.

The pattern of depths in the 0m to 50m range is very similar to 
that normally seen and reflects the amount of diving that takes 
place in these depth ranges.   
The number of incidents reported in the greater than 50m range 
is 7, which is in line with previous years.  None of these 7 
incidents was a fatality. 
  
BSAC advises that no air dive should be deeper than 50m, and 
that dives to 50m should only be conducted by divers who are 
appropriately trained and qualified.   
The recommended limit for divers trained to Sports Diver 
standard is 35m and then only when they have received 
appropriate training for diving at this depth. 
BSAC recommends that helium mixtures are used for depths 
deeper than 40m and that mixed gas diving should be to a 
maximum depth of 80m.  Mixed gas dives should only be 
conducted when the diver holds a recognized qualification to 
conduct such dives.  
See the BSAC website for more details of these and other 
diving depth limit recommendations.  
 
The next chart shows the depths at which incidents started.

Inevitably the data are biased towards the shallower depths 
since many incidents happen during the ascent or at the 
surface.  Critical among these are the DCI cases where almost 
always the casualty is out of the water before any problems are 
noted.  This partially explains the large occurrence of ‘Surface’ 
cases as this includes divers with DCI who have left the water. 
Other surface incidents involve boats and boating incidents. 
 
 
Diver qualifications 
The next two charts show the qualification of those BSAC 
members who were involved in reported incidents.

Divers’ use of the Emergency Services 
Divers’ use of the emergency services shows a monthly 
distribution aligned to the distribution of all incidents, and is 
clearly correlated with the number of dives that are taking place. 
 
2006 saw a dramatic drop in our demands upon the Coastguard 
service, but in 2007 and 2008 the number of reports from the 
Coastguard has risen back to a norm of the last 11 years of 
around 200 per year.  2008 recorded 192 incidents involving the 
Coastguard so this is entirely inline with expectations.    
 
There was some concern that the industrial relations problems 
experienced within the service might adversely affect their 
reporting ability; this does not seem to have been the case.

Incidents involving HM Coastguard: 192  
 
 
There were 92 incidents reported that involved the RNLI and 
although this is identical to the number of incidents reported in 
2007 it continues the trend of a slow reduction in divers’ calls on 
the lifeboat service. 
The following chart shows the distribution of the RNLI related 
incidents throughout this incident year.  It is in line with the 
other monthly based data, except that the May peak is missing.

In 2008 107 incidents involved the use of helicopters.  This 
number suggests a levelling out in the number of incidents 
involving a helicopter to an 11 year average of around 100 per 
year.   
Helicopters are often tasked to support searches for missing 
divers and to transport divers with DCI to recompression 
facilities.

Fatalities 
10 fatal incidents occurred in the UK during the 2008 incident 
year.  This is significantly below the average of 17.3 fatalities 
per year over the previous ten years.  However, comparisons of 
this nature need to be made with caution since a small change 
can make a big apparent difference to the comparison.   
Although it is clearly a good thing that this number is way below 
the average of recent years it hides the sad fact that 6 of these 
people were BSAC members.  The ten year average for BSAC 
fatalities in the UK is 6.0 fatalities per year and thus, from a 
member’s perspective, the year has, unfortunately, been an 
average one.   
 
The factors associated with these fatalities can be summarised 
as follows:- 
• One case involved a diver who is thought to have suffered a 
heart attack and there are two other cases where it seems 
very likely that an acute medical problem was the root 
cause, but there is currently no hard evidence to prove this.  
• Six cases involved a separation of some kind.  In one case 
a diver was lost in low visibility inside a wreck.  In two cases 
divers became separated from their buddies during the 
ascent phase of the dive.  One case involved a snorkel 
diver who was in difficulties and became separated from his 
buddy.  One case relates to a diver found unconscious 
underwater; the preceding events are currently not known.  
The last case relates to a diver who elected to leave his 
buddy and to rest on some rocks after surfacing from a 
dive.   
• Two cases involved divers using rebreathers and while the 
role of the rebreather in the incident is not clear; problems 
with or misuse of the system can not be ruled out. 
• One case involved a diver who became trapped inside a 
wreck and ran out of air.   
• Two cases involved three people diving together and in 
both these cases an underwater separation occurred when 
problems arose during the ascent.  
• One case involved a diver who made a buoyant ascent due 
to items that he was carrying pressing on his drysuit 
inflation valve.   
 
Often multiple causes were involved in an incident and in five of 
the fatal incidents there is currently insufficient information 
available to be clear about the exact chain of events and root 
causes. 
 
Finally there were five reported fatalities overseas.  Four of 
these involved the deaths of BSAC members.   
• One case involved a double fatality (one BSAC member 
and a non-member) who were lost while cave diving.   
• One case involved a diver who became separated from her 
buddy after apparently surfacing normally from a dive.   
• One case involved a diver who became trapped in low 
visibility inside a wreck.   
• One case relates to a diver who was diving effectively solo 
who suffered heart failure while underwater.   
 
 
 
Decompression incidents 
The BSAC database contains 125 reports of ‘DCI’ incidents in 
the 2008 incident year, some of which involved more than one 
casualty.  When these multiple cases are counted the result is 
132 cases of DCI. 
As stated earlier this number takes us back to the level of cases 
that were typical around five years ago.   
 
 
 
An analysis of the causal factors associated with the 125 
incidents reported in 2008 indicates the following major 
features:- 
44 involved repeat diving

Incidents involving Lifeboats: 92

  ` NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2008 
4        ©BSAC - 2008 
38 involved rapid ascents 
23 involved diving to deeper than 30m 
15 involved missed decompression stops  
Some cases involved more than one of these causes. 
 
Some of the ‘Injury and Illness’ incidents are also thought to be 
DCI related, but they are reported by the RNLI as ‘Diver illness’ 
and the cause of the illness is not defined. The number of 
incidents in this category in 2008 is at a level similar to the 
average of recent years.   
 
 
 
Ascent related incidents 
As stated earlier the number of cases of ‘Ascent’ related 
problems has fallen dramatically and some of this decline is 
likely to be due to the focus that has been placed on this 
important area of diving skill. 
 
68 cases of ‘Ascent’ problems have been recorded in 2008 and 
nearly all of these were ‘Rapid ascents’.  An analysis of these 
‘Rapid ascents’ (where the detail is known) is as follows:- 
 22% Weighting or weight related problems 
 17% Regulator free flows 
 15% Simply poor buoyancy control 
 15% Delayed SMB problems 
    7% Panic / anxiety / rush for surface 
    7% Out of air / gas 
    7% Various equipment problems 
   5% Drysuit control malfunction 
    5% Rebreather problems 
 
Many DCI cases have their roots in these problems; they have 
been recorded under the ‘DCI’ heading but the causal factors 
are often the same, so the actual number of abnormal ascents 
will be significantly higher than 68 cases.   
One potential explanation for the increase in ‘DCI’ incidents and 
a reduction in ‘Ascent’ incidents is that more poor ascents have 
resulted in DCI than in previous years.  
 
 
 
Boating and surface incidents 
Recent years have seen a very marked decline in the number of 
these incidents from a maximum of 124 in 1998.  In 2008 there 
were 52 such incidents reported and this continues this 
remarkable trend of improvement. 
 
43% of these incidents involved engine problems and 43% 
involved lost divers; this is entirely consistent with previous 
years with the bulk of the improvement coming from the boating 
elements of the category.  
 
Many of the engine problems could have been prevented by 
better planning (to avoid running out of fuel) and correct 
servicing.   
The lost diver category is one that has been the subject of 
much comment in the past.  Good planning, care and attention 
from the cox and dive manager, and effective surface detection 
aids are critical.   
Planning, care and attention will help to prevent the divers from 
becoming lost in the first place, and effective surface detection 
aids will enable the divers to be found rapidly should the first 
part fail. 
 
 
 
Conclusions 
Key conclusions are:- 
• The number of incidents reported each year in the UK 
seems to be levelling out to around 400. 
• The number of fatalities of BSAC members is in line with 
the average of the previous 10 years. 
• The number of fatalities of non-BSAC members is 
dramatically lower than the average of the previous 10 
years. 
• Cases of DCI have risen dramatically taking us back to 
levels equivalent to five years ago. 
• Cases of ‘Ascent’ problems have dropped dramatically, 
halting the trend of increasing problems in this category 
observed over the last 10 years.   
• No new causal factors for incidents have been identified.  
Continuous skills practice, rigorous buddy checks and 
diving within one’s current ability limits, with a slow 
progression to new areas, are the critical keys to safe 
diving. 
 
As has been stated many times before, most of the incidents 
reported within this document could have been avoided had 
those involved followed a few basic principles of safe diving 
practice.  The BSAC publishes a booklet called 'Safe Diving' 
(latest edition published in June 2007). which summarises all 
the key elements of safe diving and is available to all, free of 
charge, from the BSAC website or through BSAC HQ. 
 
Remember you can never have too much practice and the 
further you stay away from the limits of your own personal 
capabilities the more likely you are to continue to enjoy your 
diving. 
 
Please browse through the details in this report and use them to 
learn from others’ mistakes. They have had the courage and 
generosity to record their experiences for publication, the least 
that we can do is to use this information to avoid similar 
problems. 
 
Finally, if you must have an incident please report it using our 
Incident Report form, available free via the BSAC website or 
from BSAC HQ. 
As always, your anonymity is assured – great care is taken to 
preserve the confidentiality of any personal information 
recorded in BSAC Incident Reports.

Fatalities 
 
October 2007  08/002 
A pair of divers entered a wreck.  They swam some distance 
inside and then turned to leave.  The cylinder of one of the 
divers got caught and the other diver helped to free it.  In doing 
so they stirred up silt inside the wreck and this obscured their 
exit.  They held on to each other and searched for the way out.  
At one point one of the divers let go of the other one to check 
his gauges.  The divers then lost contact with each other.  The 
diver who had checked his gauges eventually found the exit and 
for a while he searched for his buddy.  With 37 min of 
decompression requirements and 80 to 90 bars remaining he 
started his ascent alone.  He sent up an emergency buoy and 
another diver came to his assistance.  Other divers descended 
to the wreck and a surface search was mounted involving a 
helicopter, two lifeboats and other craft but the missing diver 
was not found.  An ROV search also failed to locate the missing 
diver.

March 2008 08/042 
Three divers descended to a wreck which lay down a slope.  At 
24m the conditions were good and the three agreed to continue 
to move down the wreck.  At 47m one of the three signalled that 
they should start to make their way back up the wreck.  As they 
turned they stirred up silt and the visibility reduced.  Then one of 
the divers signalled that he was unhappy and wanted to 
ascend.  At this point another of the divers felt his weightbelt 
slip, they stirred up more silt and the third diver moved away 
slightly to get into clearer water.  The diver whose weightbelt 
had slipped then lost the belt completely and he made a 
buoyant ascent to the surface.  At no time during this ascent did 
he see either of the other divers.  The third diver who had 
moved back out of the silt saw two torches ascending and 
assumed that the second diver had taken the diver who had 
signalled for an ascent to the surface.  The third diver followed 
the wreck back upwards and surfaced after a duration of 21 
min, including a 2 min decompression stop, about 5 min after 
the buoyant diver had surfaced.  The diver who had signalled 
that he wanted to ascend did not return to the surface.  The 
other two divers both assumed that he was with the other one.  
Another two divers entered the water and conducted a search 
of the shallow end of the wreck but they found no trace of the 
missing diver.  The Coastguard was alerted and an extensive 
surface search was conducted involving a helicopter, a lifeboat 
and other craft.  Other divers searched the wreck that day and 
the following day but no trace of the missing diver was found. 
April 2008 08/057 
Two divers conducted full buddy checks and then entered the 
water to descend a shotline to a wreck.  One of the pair was 
using a rebreather with air as the diluent; the other was using 
open circuit air.  They exchanged 'OK' signals as they 
descended.  At about 35m they could see the light of other 
divers below them on the wreck.  They exchanged 'OK' signals 
again but immediately afterwards the rebreather diver began to 
signal rapidly with his left hand.  The buddy moved to help him.  
The rebreather diver was now sinking quickly.  The buddy 
followed after him and they arrived on the seabed at 42m.  The 
rebreather diver was motionless, face down on the bottom.  The 
buddy was suffering from nitrogen narcosis but he attempted a 
diluent flush on the unconscious diver's rebreather, he also 
attempted to inflate his suit.  He noticed that the head up 
display on the rebreather was flashing red.  The buddy tried to 
lift the unconscious diver from the seabed.  He tried a number 
of times but lost his grip and made a buoyant ascent to the 
surface.  His dive duration was 9 min.  He was recovered into 
the boat and the Coastguard was alerted.  An extensive air and 
sea search was conducted and an ROV was used to search 
around the wreck but the missing diver was not found.  The 
diver's body was recovered from near the stern of the wreck 
over seven weeks later. 
May 2008 08/069 
A party of divers travelled to a wreck site.  A number of them 
became seasick and did not dive, as a result of this a group of 
three dived together.  During the dive they all checked their 
contents gauges and all had 100 bar.  About 2 min later the dive 
leader signalled that they should ascend, they all agreed.  At 
this point one of the divers recalls that he had 85 bar.  They 
ascended together making a slight pause at 10m and stopping 
at 6m to make a safety stop.  At this point one of the three tried 
to reach one of the other divers' octopus regulator and he 
attempted to dump his weights.  This diver then started to sink.  
One of the others went after him but then surfaced rapidly and 
raised the alarm.  An extensive search was organised involving 
four lifeboats, a helicopter and other craft but the diver was not 
found.   His body was recovered from near the wreck over four 
weeks later.  (Media reports). 
May 2008 08/078 
Two divers descended a shotline to a wreck.  At 38m they found 
a third diver unconscious, tangled in his reel, with his mask 
missing and his regulator out of his mouth.  They inflated his 
BCD and sent him to the surface.  The diver had been 
underwater for 15 min.  The casualty was recovered into the 
boat and resuscitation techniques were applied.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and the casualty was airlifted to 
hospital where he was pronounced dead. 
June 2008 08/080 
A group of divers planned a dive on a wreck which was 
positioned close to the shoreline.  There was breaking swell 
above the wreck so the plan was for the divers to descend to 
the seabed about 35m from the shore at a depth of 26m and 
then to swim underwater to the wreck.  They planned to return

by the same route.  One trio and three pairs of divers entered 
the water to conduct the dive.  The first pair returned to the boat 
as planned and shortly afterwards a second pair, who were 
using rebreathers, surfaced above the wreck in the swell.  
These divers then started to swim out of the rough water 
towards the boat.  One of the pair made it to the boat but the 
other turned round in the rough water and swam to rocks by the 
shore and climbed onto them; once out of the water he was 
seen to sit down on a rock ledge.  At this time two other divers 
were making their ascent.  One of this pair felt unnerved by the 
strong water surges and began to hyperventilate, this led to 
panic and he made a rapid ascent to the surface.  At the 
surface this diver appeared conscious but made no attempt to 
swim to the boat and did not answer when those in the boat 
called to him.  No one in the boat was ready to enter the water 
and the boat could not approach this diver because of rocks.  
After about 2 min this diver's buddy surfaced close to him and 
assisted him to the boat.  The troubled diver attempted to climb 
the ladder but fell off backwards.  The regulator was knocked 
from his mouth and part of his equipment became tangled with 
the ladder.  The motion of the boat caused him to be 
intermittently plunged underwater with no means of breathing.  
Others shouted at him to replace his regulator but he failed to 
do so.  Divers in the water and people on the deck were able to 
free the trapped diver and he was assisted aboard. He was 
placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  A 
helicopter and a lifeboat were tasked to assist.  The diver was 
conscious throughout but pale, subdued and complained of 
being cold.  The sudden onset of poor visibility caused the 
helicopter to abandon its attempts to help.  The diver was taken 
by lifeboat to hospital.  He was subsequently recompressed, but 
this resulted in no improvement to his condition.  He made a 
steady recovery and was discharged from hospital the following 
day.  This diver had been suffering from diarrhoea and 
seasickness prior to the dive.  While all this was taking place 
the diver who had swum ashore was still seen sitting on the 
rocks.  In order to assist this diver back to the boat a member of 
the party snorkelled to him and planned to help him swim with 
the now changed water current through the rocks into clear 
water where they would be recovered by the boat.  The snorkel 
diver reached the shore and discovered that the diver who had 
climbed on the rocks had died.  He signalled the boat for help 
and three other divers entered the water and went to assist.  
The Coastguard was alerted of a further problem.  Two of the 
divers then returned to the boat and the Coastguard was 
informed of the situation.  The diver's body was eventually 
recovered into a lifeboat and taken to a harbour.   It is thought 
that he suffered a heart attack. 
June 2008 08/123 
A group of divers completed a 32m wreck dive and then 
travelled to a second site to conduct a drift dive to gather 
scallops in a maximum depth of 24m.  Three pairs of divers 
entered the water for this dive.  One pair of divers collected a lot 
of scallops which they retained in bags.  One of the divers then 
found a cannon ball which he sent to the surface under a lifting 
bag.  The second diver also found a cannon ball which he tried 
to put in his scallop bag.  The first diver then passed him 
another bag for the cannon ball and expected him to fasten it to 
his lifting bag and send it to the surface but the second diver did 
not do this.  Instead he continued the dive holding on to the 
cannon ball in the bag.  The first diver again prompted him to lift 
the cannon ball but he declined.  About 5 min later the diver 
with the cannon ball signalled that they should ascend.  The first 
diver then looked down to fasten his scallop bag to his 
weightbelt and to reel in the SMB line.  When he looked back 
the diver with the cannon ball had gone.  He conducted a brief 
search for the missing diver and then started his ascent with his 
computer indicating a total ascent duration, including stops, of 
11 min.  He made his first decompression stop at about 5m.  At 
this point he looked up and saw his buddy at the surface looking 
down at him.  He signalled him to re-descend to join him to 
conduct his decompression stops but he didn't.  He saw that the 
diver had the scallop and cannon ball bags clipped to a D ring 
on his chest.  He swam up to the diver at a depth of about 2m 
and attempted to pull him down, but he could not do so.  His 
computer was showing an error state.  He tried twice, then the 
SMB line was cut and he thought that his buddy was resolving 
the problem.  The diver then sank rapidly and struggled to 
regain the correct depth.  A boat passed over his head and the 
propeller just missed him.  He returned to about 6m and 
completed a 15 min decompression stop.  There was a lot of 
boat traffic so he waited a further minute before surfacing.  He 
was recovered into another boat.  The diver who had surfaced 
with the scallops and cannon ball was seen by those in his boat 
floating face down.  They shouted at him but got no response.  
The boat approached him and one of the party re-entered the 
water to assist the troubled diver.  The rescuing diver attempted 
to turn him into a face up position but could not do so.  The 
diver was brought to the back of the boat where equipment was 
removed from him and he was recovered into the boat.  The 
diver was not conscious and resuscitation techniques were 
applied.  The Coastguard was alerted and the casualty was 
airlifted to hospital where he was declared dead.  It was 
subsequently found that the casualty had not taken his lifting 
bag on the dive with him.  The cause of death was diffused gas 
embolism due to pulmonary barotrauma.  Media reporting of an 
inquest reported findings that the diver had made a rapid ascent 
as a result of the bags that he was carrying pressing on his 
drysuit inflation valve and causing him to lose control of his 
buoyancy. 
July 2008 08/124 
A diver surfaced from a dive and signalled for assistance.  He 
complained of feeling unwell and shortly after being helped 
back into the boat he collapsed and lost consciousness.  
Resuscitation techniques were applied and the Coastguard was 
alerted.  The diver was airlifted to hospital where he was 
declared dead.  (Coastguard report).

Two divers ascended at the end of a dive.  At 10m they 
exchanged OK signals but then became separated.  There were 
problems starting the engine of their boat.  One of the pair was 
recovered into another boat and the other was seen at the 
surface with his BCD inflated.  Contact was then lost with this 
diver.  The Coastguard was alerted and an extensive search 
was conducted involving five lifeboats, four helicopters and 
other craft.  Twenty days later the body of the missing diver was

seen by a member of the public floating at the surface; it was 
recovered. 
September 2008 08/151 
Two snorkel divers were conducting a shore dive when one of 
the pair developed difficulty breathing.  His buddy shouted for 
help and attempted to support him at the surface.  A person on 
the shore heard the shouts and raised the alarm.  A swell took 
the troubled diver away from his buddy who swam ashore for 
help.  A lifeboat was launched and the diver was recovered.  
Resuscitation techniques were applied and the diver was 
airlifted to hospital where he was declared dead.

Decompression Incidents 
 
October 2007  08/011 
The Coastguard was alerted when a diver developed possible 
symptoms of DCI.  The diver was taken to a medical facility for 
examination.  The diver was placed on oxygen but no 
recompression treatment was required.  (Coastguard report). 
October 2007 08/005 
Two divers dived to a maximum depth of 42m for 43 min 
including 15 min of decompression stops.  One of the divers 
developed a back pain and tingling in his right leg.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and the diver and his buddy were 
airlifted to a recompression facility for treatment.  (Coastguard 
report). 
October 2007 08/036 
Two divers undertook a dive to a maximum depth of 29m.  16 
min into the dive one of the pair indicated that she had 110 bar 
remaining.  One minute later she indicated that she had 70 bar 
remaining.  The divers deployed a delayed SMB and started 
their ascent.  During the ascent the diver who was low on air 
lost control of her buoyancy and made a rapid ascent to the 
surface.  At the surface she found it hard to get air from her 
regulator and the contents gauge read zero.  Her buddy 
continued to ascend and then found himself next to the SMB 
line; concerned that his buddy may have sunk back down he 
followed the line downwards again.  At 22m the line turned 
upwards again so he re-ascended.  He made a 4 min stop at 
6m and then surfaced.  Once back in the boat both divers were 
placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  The diver 
who had made the rapid ascent developed a slight pain on the 
left side of her neck and a tingling in the fingers of her left hand.  
The neck pain resolved once she was on oxygen.  She was 
airlifted to a recompression facility for treatment.  90 min after 
surfacing the buddy developed pains in his lower back and 
shoulders and then behind his knees.  He sought diving medical 
advice and reported to a recompression facility where he 
received treatment.  It was concluded that the diver had 
suffered some kind of equipment failure resulting in the loss of 
air.  (Coastguard report). 
October 2007 08/009 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 30m using 
nitrox 31.  After 51 min he ascended to 17m where he made a 2 
min stop.  He then ascended to 9m.  During this part of his 
ascent he lost control of his buoyancy and made a rapid ascent 
to the surface, missing 20 min of decompression stops.  He was 
recovered into the boat, placed on oxygen and the Coastguard 
was alerted.  The diver was airlifted to a recompression facility 
for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
October 2007 08/026 
Two divers conducted a 33 min dive to a maximum depth of 
23m.  They made a normal ascent including a 3 min safety stop 
at 5m.  About 10 min after getting back into the boat one of the 
pair complained of a numbness and a loss of movement down 
the left side of his body.  He was placed on oxygen and the 
Coastguard was alerted.  He was given water to drink and his 
condition improved.  The boat returned to harbour and the diver 
was taken by ambulance and helicopter to a recompression 
facility where he was treated for DCI.  It is thought that he 
suffered an embolism due to a lung problem. 
October 2007 08/030 
Two divers were involved in a training course.  One of the pair 
got into difficulties and they both made a rapid ascent to the 
surface.  The emergency services were alerted and the divers 
were airlifted to a recompression facility for treatment.  (Media 
report). 
October 2007 08/015 
The Coastguard was alerted when three divers made a rapid 
ascent from 2m.  They had made repeated shallow dives.  One 
of the group had a problem with their suit inflation which caused 
a buoyant ascent.  All divers were exhibiting ill effects but one of 
the three was in a worse condition than the others.  They were 
taken by ambulance to hospital for examination.  (Coastguard 
report). 
November 2007 08/019 
Three divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 
30m.  They were the last group to enter the water and after 30 
min one of the three used a lifting bag to recover the 
shotweight.  This diver struggled to inflate the bag and used 
more air than expected.  The three then started their ascent 
with 10 min of decompression indicated on their computers.  
During the ascent the diver who had inflated the bag became 
positively buoyant and, at 10m, he lost control of his buoyancy 
and was carried rapidly to the surface.  The other two followed, 
stopping briefly at 10m.  Once back in the boat the diver who 
had made the buoyant ascent complained of an ache in his 
right arm and one of the others complained of elbow and joint 
pain.  The Coastguard was alerted and all three were airlifted to 
a recompression facility for treatment for DCI.  The diver who 
had made the buoyant ascent had used a thicker than normal 
undersuit and had taken 2 kg off his weightbelt. 
November 2007 08/020 
A diver conducted a dive to 64m using trimix 17/35 with nitrox 
40 and 100% oxygen used during decompression stops.  His 
total dive duration was 110 min.  After this dive he experienced 
a tightness in his left arm and shoulder.  The following day he 
dived to 65m for a total of about 120 min.  His ascent profile 
was as follows: 65m to 30m, 6 min on trimix; 30m to 9m,  24 
min on nitrox 40; 9m to 6m, 44 min on oxygen; then he 
surfaced.  During this ascent, at a depth of 15m, he noticed an 
itching across his shoulders and a tightening in his left arm and 
chest.  On surfacing the itching spread and he developed an 
ache in his left arm, shoulder, chest and upper legs.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and the diver was airlifted to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  The diver had been 
treated for DCI the previous year and had had symptoms of skin 
DCI and swelling after a number of previous dives.  
(Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
November 2007 08/021 
An instructor and two trainees were conducting mask clearing 
and air sharing drills.  One of the trainees stated that she was 
concerned about mask removal underwater as she was wearing 
contact lenses.  They descended to a maximum depth of 16m 
and one of the trainees completed the mask clearing drill.  The 
instructor invited the diver with the contact lenses to partially 
flood her mask but she declined.  The instructor then signalled 
this diver to simulate out of air.  This she did and, using the 
buddy's octopus regulator, they all ascended to about 5m.  
During this ascent the diver receiving air felt that the octopus 
regulator hose was too short and it was difficult for her to retain 
the regulator in her mouth; she swallowed some water.  Also, 
during the ascent, the diver was concerned about their ascent 
rate and the action of trying to see her computer put a further

strain on the hose making the problem worse.  The instructor 
signalled that they should re-descend and as they did so, at 
about 9m, the diver receiving air tried to change back to her 
own main regulator.  She put her regulator into her mouth but 
then rejected it.  She reached for the buddy's octopus regulator, 
put it into her mouth, but rejected this too.  She then grabbed 
her buddy's main regulator from her buddy's mouth but rejected 
this too.  She subsequently reported that none of the regulators 
appeared to work although no faults were subsequently found.  
The divers had descended back to the seabed.  The buddy 
managed to recover his main regulator and the instructor 
placed his octopus regulator into the distressed trainee's mouth.  
He held it there until she was able to breathe from it.  He then 
used a controlled buoyant lift to bring her to the surface; the 
second trainee went with them. Their ascent rate was 'brisk' but 
not excessive.   The divers were recovered into their boat, the 
troubled diver was placed on oxygen and the boat returned to 
the shore.  The troubled diver developed a dull ache in her left 
shoulder.  The Coastguard was alerted and the diver and her 
buddy were airlifted to a recompression facility.  The diver was 
treated for DCI; her buddy required no treatment. 
November 2007 08/187 
A diver conducted a series of four dives, using air, over a two 
day period.  On the second day he dived to 46m for 45 min with 
a 10 min stop at 6m.  2 hours later he dived to 32m for 40 min 
with a 12 min stop at 6m.  After this last dive he felt a shoulder 
pain while climbing the ladder back into the boat and a rash 
appeared down his back about 1 hour later.  He sought diving 
medical advice and was directed to a recompression facility.  
He was placed on oxygen for 4 hours with air breaks and he 
drank 5 litres of water in this same period.  He was given 
recompression treatment which resolved his symptoms.  A 
subsequent PFO test was negative. 
November 2007 08/034 
Two divers conducted a 41 min dive to a depth of 32m with a 2 
min stop at 18m, a 2 min stop at 14m and an 8 min stop at 5m 
during their ascent.  About 1 hour after surfacing one of the pair 
noticed a rash and itching on her left shoulder and stomach.  
She was placed on oxygen and diving medical advice sought.  
No further action was recommended and her symptoms 
resolved after 1 hour on oxygen.  7 days later she undertook a 
dive to a depth of 28m.  1 hour after this dive she reported 
similar symptoms, but the shoulder rash was more apparent 
than previously.  She was placed on oxygen and diving medical 
advice was sought.  She went to a recompression facility for 
treatment which resolved her symptoms.  She subsequently 
tested positive for a PFO.

Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 52m for a 
duration of 39 min including a 4 min stop at 11m and a 3 min 
stop at 10m.  1 hour 30 min later they dived to 43m for 38 min 
including a 3 min stop at 11m, a 5 min stop at 6m and an 11 
min stop at 3m.  At the end of each dive they made a strenuous 
walk up a steep slope from the water to their car.  During their 
journey home, one of the pair complained of a pain in a muscle 
at the top of his left arm.  The pain subsided over a 2 hour 
period.  During that night he developed joint pain and he 
attended a recompression facility for treatment.  He received 
two sessions of recompression and his symptoms were fully 
resolved. 
March 2008 08/054 
Two divers conducted a dive to a planned maximum depth of 
30m.  One of the pair was using nitrox 32.  At 30m this diver 
experienced difficulty focusing his eyes.  He felt confused and 
he made a very rapid ascent, reaching the surface in about 40 
seconds.  The divers sought medical advice and were 
recommended to attend a recompression facility.  1 hour after 
the dive the diver was placed on oxygen and further diving 
medical advice was sought.  The diver developed a rash on his 
back.  He was taken by ambulance to a recompression facility 
for treatment.  He was discharged later that day. 
March 2008 08/055 
A diver conducted a 25 min dive to a maximum depth of 22m.  
After a surface interval of 1 hour 45 min she dived to 30m for 30 
min.  After a further surface interval of 1 hour 10 min she dived 
to 21m for 34 min.  Shortly after the third dive she complained 
of feeling very cold and went to change.  She then fainted.  She 
started vomiting and was not very responsive.  She was placed 
on oxygen and the emergency services alerted.  She was taken 
by helicopter to a recompression facility where she was treated 
for DCI.  Her computer showed no violations but she later 
reported that she had had a lack of sleep and had felt 
dehydrated during the day. 
March 2008 08/059 
An instructor and a trainee conducted a 40 min dive to a 
maximum depth of 10m with a 5 min stop at about 4m.  
Towards the end of this dive both suffered from cold hands and 
this caused them to terminate the dive.  2 hours 12 min later 
they dived again.  During the dive they practised regulator 
clearance at 7m.  After 39 min both were again suffering from 
cold hands and the dive was terminated.  The trainee's arm 
continued to feel cold after the dive and the following morning 
he noticed a tingling sensation in it.  He was advised to seek 
diving medical advice.  The trainee went with his instructor to a 
recompression facility where the trainee was treated for DCI.  
His symptoms were fully resolved. 
March 2008 08/083 
Two divers conducted a series of fourteen dives over a five day 
period.  One diver dived to a maximum depth of 50m and the 
other to a maximum depth of 34m, although generally their 
dives were between 15 and 25m.  They awoke from a sleep 
early in the evening of the fifth day complaining of drowsiness 
and disorientation.  They were placed on oxygen, given fluids to 
drink and diving medical advice was sought.  The Coastguard 
was alerted and they were transported by lifeboat to a 
recompression facility.  On arrival one of the pair was suffering 
from dizziness, disorientation, confusion and had pain in his left 
elbow, right knee, left ankle and the left side of his chest.  The 
other diver had similar symptoms and generalised pain on his 
right side.  They both received three sessions of recompression 
therapy and were released from hospital three days later.

An instructor and a trainee conducted a shore dive to a 
maximum depth of 15m.  During the dive they practised ascents 
using the buddy's alternative air source.  The trainee's air 
consumption was high and the instructor cut the dive short.  
They surfaced from 9m and made a surface swim back to the 
shore.  Once ashore the trainee collapsed.  He was placed on 
oxygen and a 999 call was made to the Coastguard.  He was 
taken by ambulance to a recompression facility where he was 
successfully treated for DCI.  He was advised to take a test for 
a PFO.

Clyde Coastguard was alerted to a diver suffering from 
suspected DCI and medical connect call was made with 
Aberdeen Royal infirmary for advice.  The diver had descended 
to 35m.  The casualty was evacuated by lifeboat to 
Dunstaffnage chamber.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
April 2008 08/060 
A diver conducted a 54 min dive to a maximum depth of 14m.  
Some time later he dived to 13m.  During the dive he felt a little 
buoyant and he opened the drysuit dump valve.  He still felt 
buoyant so he tried to release some air from his BCD.  A 
combination of cold hands and gloves caused him to press the 
inflator button at the same time and he made a rapid ascent to 
the surface.  His dive duration was 8 min.  He developed a 
tingling and muscle cramp in his left leg, his reflexes were rapid 
in both legs and he felt dizzy.  The Coastguard was alerted and 
the diver was airlifted to a recompression facility for treatment.  
(Coastguard report). 
April 2008 08/305 
A diver conducted a 34 min dive to a maximum depth of 19m 
including a 4 min stop at 6m.  3 hours 10 min later he dived to 
16m for 32 min with an 8 min stop at 6m.  Both dives were 
using nitrox 28.  That night he developed a pain in his upper 
arm which he thought to be a strained muscle.  The following 
day the pain eased but then increased that night and the next 
day.  He attended his local hospital where he was admitted.  He 
was told that if it had been a DCI he would have recovered by 
then.  2 hours after admission he developed other symptoms 
and after a further 4 hours the hospital sought advice from a 
recompression facility.  An hour later he was discharged from 
hospital and told to make his own way to the recompression 
facility.  This he did and he received two sessions of 
recompression treatment which resolved his symptoms. 
April 2008 08/189 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 50m using 
nitrox 27.  His dive duration was 42 min including stops using 
nitrox 80.  After this dive he reported an itching of his right 
shoulder and arm and a dull ache.  Diving medical advice was 
sought and he attended a recompression facility.  DCI was 
diagnosed and he received three sessions of recompression 
therapy.  During this period he also developed a swelling of his 
right shoulder and arm.  This was diagnosed as a lymphatic 
DCI and its cause was thought to be due to an overly tight strap 
over his shoulder.  He had removed the chest strap from his 
equipment and this is believed to have worsened the situation. 
April 2008 08/067 
Stornoway Coastguard was alerted to a diver suffering from 
suspected DCI, Stornoway Coastguard tasked Coastguard 
rescue helicopter R-100 to airlift the casualty to Dunstaffnage 
recompression chamber, the helicopter was met by Canna 
Coastguard rescue team who prepared the landing site.

A diver conducted a 28 min dive to 36m including a 3 min stop 
at 6m.  After this dive she felt a 'twinge' in her shoulder but put 
this down to lifting diving equipment.  After a surface interval of 
2 hours 45 min she dived to 30m for 32 min with a 3 min stop at 
9m and a 1 min stop at 6m.  After this dive the symptoms in her 
shoulder developed into a 'hot muscle' sensation across her 
back.  No rash was present.  She was placed on oxygen, given 
fluids and diving medical advice was sought.  Once ashore a 
skin DCI was diagnosed and she was transferred to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  Initially she thought that a 
recent operation had contributed to the problem but subsequent 
tests revealed that she had a large PFO. 
May 2008 08/190 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 23m.  One 
of the pair was using air, the other nitrox 30.  As they started 
their ascent the air diver became buoyant.  The other diver took 
hold of the air diver in an attempt to slow the ascent and they 
both made a direct ascent to the surface missing a planned 3 
min safety stop.  Their dive duration was 26 min.  Once back in 
the boat the diver who had been on nitrox became seasick 
while they waited to collect other divers.  On the return trip her 
condition worsened and she struggled to breathe.  She was 
placed on oxygen and began to feel better.  Once the boat 
reached shore the diver was helped from the boat and it 
became clear that she could not walk unaided.  Diving medical 
advice was sought and she was taken to a recompression 
facility.  During this time she developed numbness and 'pins 
and needles' in her legs.  She was given recompression 
treatment for DCI. 
May 2008 08/297 
Two divers dived to a maximum depth of 30m.  They drifted with 
a current and 25 min into the dive one of the pair signalled that 
he was down to 50 bar.  His buddy deployed a delayed SMB 
which took some time to do.  As they started their ascent the 
current had strengthened and they drifted apart a little.  The 
diver with the SMB swam towards his buddy and noticed that

the line was going slack.  At 25m they got a fast ascent 
warning.  By this time the buddy had run out of air and he 
grabbed the spare regulator of the diver with the SMB.  The 
diver who was out of air was pulling the other diver to the 
surface.  They attempted to slow the ascent but were carried to 
the surface missing planned safety stops.  Their dive duration 
was 37 min.  They were recovered into their boat.  On the return 
journey the diver who had had the SMB started to experience 
difficulty breathing.  He was placed on oxygen and the 
Coastguard was alerted.  He was taken by ambulance to 
hospital and from there to a recompression facility for treatment.

Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 29m.  One 
of the pair was using a rebreather with trimix diluent and the 
other open circuit air.  The divers descended a shotline, swam 
along a wreck and then turned back.  They looked for 
somewhere to settle to deploy a delayed SMB and during this 
period they became separated for a brief period.  Once together 
again the diver on open circuit air signalled that she wanted to 
ascend; the other diver signalled her to stop, she then deployed 
her delayed SMB and they started to ascend.  At 26m the diver 
using open circuit air started a rapid ascent.  She tried to dump 
air from her drysuit cuff dump but was not able to do so.  She 
took hold of the SMB line, but then released it when she 
realised that she was pulling her buddy up too.  She made a 
rapid ascent to the surface.  At the surface she inflated her BCD 
and signalled the boat.  She was recovered into the boat and 
placed on oxygen.  Her buddy made a normal ascent.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and the diver and her buddy were 
airlifted to a recompression facility where both divers were 
treated for symptoms of DCI.  Both divers had dived the 
previous day, the air diver to 34m for 22 min and the rebreather 
diver to 34m with a second dive to 18m.  It was subsequently 
suggested that the drysuit of the diver who had made the 
buoyant ascent was too small and that the cuffs had been taped 
which had prevented the release of air. 
May 2008 08/076 
Three divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 20m.  
They made their ascent using a delayed SMB and planned to 
make a 3 min safety stop at 5m.  During the ascent the 
weightbelt of one of the divers began to slip.  At about 10m the 
weightbelt was around her knees and she was unable to fin.  
One of her buddies took hold of her and indicated to her that 
she should fin.  He noticed that she had only 20 bar remaining; 
he prepared his alternative air supply for her.  By this time they 
had sunk back down to 11m.  The troubled diver removed the 
weightbelt and handed it to her buddy then made a buoyant 
ascent to the surface.  At the surface she inflated her BCD.  All 
three were recovered into the boat.  The diver who had made 
the buoyant ascent was placed on oxygen.  She developed a 
tightness in her chest and 'pins and needles' in her fingers and 
toes.  The Coastguard was alerted and the diver was airlifted to 
a recompression facility for treatment.  The casualty's diving 
cylinder was later reported to have been found empty.  This was 
the casualty's first sea dive in the UK.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2008 08/103 
A diver commenced a dive to a maximum depth of 23m.  On the 
descent he noticed that he was under-weighted but decided to 
continue.  After 35 min he prepared to deploy a delayed SMB.  
He felt buoyant and put some rocks into his BCD pockets to try 
to compensate.  He started to rise and he attempted to squeeze 
air from his drysuit.  He adopted a horizontal position to slow his 
ascent and rose buoyantly to the surface missing an planned 
safety stop at 3m.  His computer showed an ascent rate 
warning.  About 30 min after surfacing he felt a tingling and pain 
in his left arm.  He was placed on oxygen and the pain at first 
eased and then returned.  Diving medical advice was sought 
and the diver was taken to a recompression facility where he 
was treated for DCI.  The diver was making his first sea dive 
with a new, larger, BCD. 
May 2008 08/330 
Diver showing signs of DCI with tingling in his feet following a 
rapid ascent from 8m.  A normal ascent was carried out to 6m, 
he then started sinking and was stopped at 8m by his buddy, 
then went buoyant to surface.  Transferred by ambulance to 
hospital for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2008 08/108 
A group of four divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum 
depth of 29m.  At the end of the dive they made a slow ascent 
up the shotline.  They stopped at 5m.  At this point one of the 
divers lost control of his buoyancy and missed the planned 4 
min stop.  Back on the boat he did not feel well.  He was placed 
on oxygen and the emergency services were alerted.  The diver 
was airlifted to a recompression facility; he had an ache in his 
right elbow and a headache and he was treated for DCI.  He 
had conducted three dives on the previous two days.  
(Coastguard report). 
May 2008 08/077 
Diver made a rapid ascent from 35m and had pain in feet and 
shoulders.  Advice was taken from INM and the diver was 
airlifted by Rescue Helicopter to a Hyperbaric Chamber for 
treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2008 08/274 
A pair of divers conducted a drift dive in a maximum depth of 
22m.  33 min into the dive one of the pair was down to 80 bar 
and the dive leader signalled the ascent.  After 34 min at a 
depth of 14m the dive leader's computer indicated that he 
should slow down, he did so but his buddy didn't and he lost 
sight of him.  The dive leader made a normal ascent including a 
3 min stop at 6m.  The buddy had been unable to dump air from 
his drysuit and he was carried to the surface.  Back in the boat 
he complained of a tingling sensation in his lips, he breathed 
nitrox and then oxygen.  Once the oxygen cylinder was empty 
the diver had no symptoms.  The following day the diver 
attended a recompression facility and received two sessions of 
treatment for DCI.  The diver suggested that his drysuit dump 
valve had been blocked from the inside by a flap that covered 
the zip. 
May 2008 08/121 
Two divers conducted a dive to 26m.  After about 18 min one of 
the pair had 100 bar and the other 127 bar.  One of the pair felt 
uneasy and signalled that he wanted to ascend.  He started to 
deploy a delayed SMB but it was incorrectly fastened to the 
reel.  His buddy rectified the problem.  While he did so the other 
diver attempted to switch to his pony regulator but had 
difficulties with this so he took the buddy's octopus regulator.  
The divers then became buoyant and were unable to prevent 
themselves being carried to the surface.  They missed a 
planned safety stop.  The divers were recovered into the boat, 
placed on oxygen and given fluids to drink.  The troubled diver 
developed a dull ache and altered sensation in his right leg.  
The Coastguard was alerted and the divers were airlifted to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2008 08/194 
Two divers conducted a 61 min dive to a maximum depth of 
30m using nitrox 32.  During their ascent they stopped for 2 min 
at 21m, 12m and 9m and 10 min at 6m using nitrox 50.  After a 
surface interval of 5 hours they dived again to 30m for 67 min 

  ` NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2008

with the same stops as before and using the same gases.  The 
following day one of the pair experienced some tingling in his 
hands and feet.  Two days after that he sought advice from a 
recompression facility.  He received two sessions of treatment 
for DCI and his symptoms resolved. 
May 2008 08/195 
A diver conducted a 36 min dive to 30m with a 4 min stop at 9m 
and a 2 min stop at 6m using air.  3 hours 21 min later he dived 
to 24m for 29 min with a 3 min stop at 6m.  All of the stops were 
safety stops.  The following day he found a mild skin DCI on his 
back.  He sought diving medical advice and attended a 
recompression facility where he was treated. 
May 2008 08/332 
Diver who was able to walk received a 5 hour treatment at the 
hyperbaric chamber.  The details of the incident are not known.  
(Coastguard report). 
May 2008 08/333 
A diver self referred to the hyperbaric chamber for treatment.  
Treatment lasted 5 hours, details of the incident are not known.  
(Coastguard report). 
May 2008 08/334 
Two divers made a rapid ascent from 27m and missed their 
safety stop.  One of them was displaying mild signs of DCI.  
They returned to shore in the dive boat and were transferred to 
the hyperbaric chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2008 08/197 
An instructor was engaged in mask and regulator clearing and 
controlled buoyant lift training.  He dived to a maximum depth of 
6m and made at least 5 ascents during the dive.  His dive 
duration was 30 min.  After this dive he noticed 'pins and 
needles' in his hands but put this down to tight wrist seals.  He 
made two further training dives, one to 9m for 20 min and 
another to 7m for 15 min.  Several days later he took another 
diver to a recompression chamber and mentioned to a doctor 
that he had 'pins and needles' and numbness in his hands.  
Recompression was suggested and this resolved his 
symptoms.  He received a series of four further treatments.  It is 
thought that he had had an undetected spinal DCI from an 
earlier dive and that the training dives had aggravated the 
condition. 
May 2008 08/125 
A diver conducted an uneventful dive to 28m for 28 min 
including 6 min of decompression stops.  That night he woke up 
with a lot of pain in his left arm and shoulder.  Three days later 
he attended a recompression facility and was treated for DCI.  
The diver had received a shoulder injury the week before and 
this may have played a part in the incident. 
May 2008 08/109 
A diver conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 50m.  At 
48m he thought that he could hear air slowly flowing into his 
drysuit.  He signalled to his buddy to abort the dive and they 
started their ascent.  They planned to deploy a delayed SMB at 
25m.  During the ascent the diver with the suit problem rose 
above his buddy and they lost sight of each other.  The diver 
attempted to dump air from his suit and tried to disconnect the 
direct feed hose.  He attempted to slow his ascent but was 
carried directly to the surface missing about 45 min of stops.  
His dive duration was 18 min.  He was recovered into the boat 
and placed on oxygen.  The diver was nauseous and vomiting.  
The Coastguard was alerted and the diver was airlifted to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  He was released the 
following day with no residual ill effects. 
May 2008 08/111 
The emergency services were alerted when a diver made a 
rapid ascent from 18m.  He was airlifted to a recompression 
facility.  During the flight he developed pains in his legs and he 
was treated for DCI.  (Media report). 
May 2008 08/112 
A diver conducted a 40 min dive to a depth of 24m using nitrox 
32.  After a surface interval of 1 hour 50 min he dived to 21m 
using air.  During the ascent from this dive he planned to stop at 
3m for 3 min.  At the stop he ran out of air and surfaced missing 
2 min of stops.  Once back in the boat he noticed a slight pain 
in his right elbow.  He was placed on oxygen and the 
Coastguard was alerted.  He was airlifted to a recompression 
facility for treatment.  This diver had completed his most recent 
dives in fresh water and he may have been under-weighted.  He 
had to work hard to stay at the stop.  He also thought that he 
stayed at depth too long.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2008 08/338 
A diver surfaced from a no problem dive with 'pins and needles' 
in both hands and a migraine headache.  The dive boat 
returned to port and the diver was evacuated to the hyperbaric 
chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2008 08/126 
Two divers conducted a 35 min dive to a depth of 4m.  Later 
that day they dived to 29m.  They made their ascent from this 
dive on a shotline.  There were other divers on this shotline and 
a strong current running.  They attempted to conduct a 
decompression stop at 4m but the current dragged the shotline 
towards a horizontal position and the divers were pulled down 
to a depth of 7m.  At this point they let go of the shotline and 
then lost control of their buoyancy.  They made a rapid ascent 
to the surface.  They were recovered into the boat and placed 
on oxygen.  The boat returned to the shore where others 
identified a potential DCI concern and called an ambulance.  
One of the pair had a pain in his right arm and left knee; the 
other diver initially had no symptoms but then developed 
hypersensitive muscle reflexes.  Both were given 
recompression treatment. 
May 2008 08/301 
Two divers conducted a 30 min dive to 26m with a 1 min stop at 
3m.  1 hour 43 min later they dived to 23m for 33 min with a 1 
min stop at 3m.  12 min later one of the pair complained of a 
slight pain in his arms and elbows and a general weakness.  He 
was placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  The 
casualty then developed pains in his lower chest, pain and 
tingling in his back and a tight feeling around his ribs.  Then his 
legs became numb and he developed pain in his lower back 
and solar plexus area.  The pain then eased but he was left with 
'a floating feeling' in his legs.  He was given water.  The diver 
was airlifted to a recompression facility where he received a 
number of recompression treatments for a spinal DCI.  A 
lifeboat was also tasked to help but turned back once the diver 
had been airlifted.  The diver was later found to have a PFO. 
May 2008 08/115 
A diver conducted a 30 min dive to a maximum depth of 35m 
with a 6 min stop at 6m.  Later that day she carried out a drift 
dive to a maximum depth of 28m.  Her dive duration was 40 min 
including a 3 min safety stop at 6m.  5 min after surfacing the

diver complained of an itchy chest and difficulty breathing.  She 
lay down and was placed on oxygen.  The Coastguard was 
alerted and diving medical advice was sought.  The diver was 
airlifted to a recompression facility where she was treated for 
the onset of a cerebral embolism.  Whilst in the recompression 
chamber the diver came very close to death but eventually 
made a good recovery.  The diver was found to have a very 
high gas loading for the normal dive pattern that she had 
conducted.  It was proposed that she may have a PFO and that 
heart strain whilst giving birth one year earlier may have been a 
factor.  Since the birth the diver had only conducted two 
previous shallow shore dives.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2008 08/114 
A diver conducted a 44 min dive to 19m.  Later that day he 
dived to a maximum depth of 21m.  During the ascent from this 
dive he made a 3 min safety stop at 6m.  During this stop he felt 
his chest tighten and he found it increasingly hard to breathe.  
He checked his gauges and regulator and found no problems.  
He cut short his stop and swam to the surface.  His total dive 
duration was 41 min.  He was recovered into the boat.  He 
complained of tingling in his wrist and hands and had a small 
rash on his lower arm.  He was placed on oxygen and the 
Coastguard was alerted.  He was airlifted to a recompression 
facility for treatment.  Ten years earlier this diver had 
experienced a similar problem which resulted in him gasping for 
breath whilst sitting at home; medical tests at the time revealed 
nothing abnormal.  Further tests were planned.  (Coastguard 
report). 
May 2008 08/113 
A diver began feeling ill after surfacing from a dive.  He was 
taken to a Hyperbaric Chamber for treatment.  Bad air was 
suspected as being the cause.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2008 08/128 
Three divers conducted a 33 min dive to a maximum depth of 
17m with a 3 min stop at 6m.  2 hours 45 min later they dived to 
a maximum depth of 20m.  The dive plan was for one of the 
three to practise compass skills and another to practise 
deploying a delayed SMB.  25 min into the dive the divers 
settled on the bottom and the diver with the delayed SMB 
prepared and launched it.  She then wound in the slack line and 
they began an ascent to 6m.  At a depth of 11m the diver with 
the SMB lost control of her buoyancy and she made a rapid 
ascent to the surface.  She later discovered that she had lost 
one of her weights and it was this that caused the uncontrolled 
ascent.  The other two divers made a normal ascent including a 
safety stop.  These two divers then returned to recover the lost 
weight.  The following day the diver who had made the rapid 
ascent felt unwell, she sought diving medical advice and was 
referred to a recompression facility where she received four 
sessions of recompression treatment. 
June 2008 08/340 
A medilink call was provided between a diver and a diving 
doctor after the diver reported symptoms of DCI in his arm and 
shoulder following a second dive of the day to 29m for 40 min.  
The doctor recommended that the diver attend the hyperbaric 
chamber for treatment.  He was transferred from the dive boat 
to a lifeboat and then taken to the chamber by ambulance.  
(Coastguard report). 
June 2008 08/341 
A diver surfaced with chest pains and no feeling in his left arm 
following a seemingly normal dive profile.  The casualty was 
placed on 100% oxygen on recovery but the boat reported that 
his condition was deteriorating quickly.  The diver and his buddy 
were airlifted by rescue helicopter to hospital for treatment.  
(Coastguard report). 
June 2008 08/120 
Three divers conducted a drift dive to a maximum depth of 21m.  
About 45 min into the dive they decided to surface.  One of the 
pair adopted a vertical position and as he did so his weightbelt 
slipped down to his thighs.  It could not fall off because he had 
clipped it to his BCD so he left it there.  He tried to ascend but 
was unbalanced by the weightbelt, so he returned to the 
seabed.  He unclipped the weightbelt and put it over his 
shoulder.  He started his ascent again.  He then found that he 
was inhaling water, after two breaths he switched to his octopus 
regulator.  During the ascent he decided to drop his weightbelt.  
He was still inhaling water, breathing deeply and panting.  At 
the surface he asked for help and is thought to have lost 
consciousness for a while.  He was recovered from the water 
and placed on oxygen.  The Coastguard was alerted and the 
diver was airlifted to a recompression facility.  He did not show 
typical signs of DCI but did have 'brisk reflexes' so he was given 
recompression treatment.  It is thought that by putting the 
weightbelt over his shoulder the diver had pulled on the 
regulator hose and this had displaced the regulator mouthpiece 
thus causing the water inhalation.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2008 08/130 
A medical link call was made to a dive doctor for medical advice 
for two divers whose computers showed a rapid ascent from 
27m, but had not become locked out.  They did not miss any 
stops, and were not displaying any signs or symptoms of DCI.  
They were placed on 100% oxygen as a precaution and the 
doctor initially advised to monitor for any signs or symptoms.  
However, a short time later one of the divers began displaying 
signs of DCI, so both were airlifted to a hyperbaric chamber for 
treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2008 08/343 
A diver reported to be suffering a sore shoulder after a second 
dive of the day, following a seemingly normal dive profile.  She 
was transferred to a hyperbaric chamber for further 
investigations as it could have been due to muscular strain.  
(Coastguard report). 
June 2008 08/122 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 30m.  During 
this dive he felt a tingling sensation and had the feeling of being 
'spaced out'.  He felt anxious and panicky.  He ascended and 
his disorientation passed but he was left with a pain in his left 
forearm and a headache.  Both symptoms resolved with time.  
He was diving in a new drysuit and thought that the condition 
was due to a tight neck seal or suit squeeze.  He attempted to 
stretch the suit to ease the fit.  Later that day he dived to 18m 
and experienced the same symptoms.  The following day he 
dived in a semi-drysuit in an attempt to avoid the problems.  At 
29m he felt 'spaced out' again and as he surfaced he developed 
a pain in his arm, and became dizzy, distant and unaware of his 
surroundings.  Back in the boat he felt shaky, weak and was 
unable to co-ordinate his movements.  He was placed on 
oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  The diver was airlifted 
to a recompression chamber.  He received four sessions of 
recompression treatment and was then referred to a specialist 
for attention to residual symptoms thought to be associated with 
the balance organ in his ear.  (Coastguard report). 
 
June 2008 08/203 
A dive boat had just recovered its pair of divers when they saw 
a lone diver by the shore.  They approached him and he said 

  ` NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2008 
 
14        ©BSAC - 2008 
that a current had swept him from his buddies and that he was 
out of air.  He swam a few metres to their boat and hung on as 
they towed him, in reverse, to his boat.  The divers in the boat 
noticed that the lone diver's computer was indicating an error 
state.  This diver then swam to his boat and asked for another 
cylinder and regulator which he was given.  The divers in the 
rescuing boat suggested that he should be placed on oxygen 
and offered theirs to him.  However the diver re-submerged and 
one of his buddies followed after him.  19 min later the divers 
re-surfaced and were recovered into their boat.  The diver 
whose computer was in error said that he felt dizzy and he 
agreed to move into the rescuing boat and take oxygen.  The 
divers in this boat then contacted the Coastguard and were 
directed to a nearby recompression facility.  They delivered the 
diver to this facility and left him in the staff's care. 
June 2008 08/205 
Two divers conducted a drift dive to a maximum depth of 37m.  
At the end of the dive they ascended to 12m where the current 
became much stronger.  The SMB was pulling one of the divers 
away from his buddy and this diver signalled for his buddy to 
close the gap between them.  In doing so he lost control of his 
drysuit and was unable to prevent a buoyant ascent to the 
surface.  His buddy followed him.  Once in the boat he informed 
the skipper of the problem but refused oxygen as he had no 
symptoms.  Two days later he noticed a pain in his right elbow 
but put it down to a muscle strain.  The following day the pain 
remained and he sought diving medical advice.  No other 
symptoms of DCI were found but he was given recompression 
treatment which resolved his symptoms.  The following day he 
was given a further session of recompression treatment.  This 
diver had conducted a series of dives and on the subject dive 
he was using nitrox 29. 
June 2008 08/134 
A diver made a series of two dives a day for a period of three 
days.  The maximum depth of these dives was 29m.  On the 
fourth day he made one dive, to 35m for 30 min. On the fifth day 
he dived to 28m for 34 min with a 3 min stop at 6m.  After this 
dive he felt itchy and tender on his shoulders, back and chest, 
but put this down to a new shirt.  After a 2 hour 55 min surface 
interval he dived to 26m for 50 min with a 3 min stop at 6m.  
The symptoms remained for about 2 hours after this second 
dive after which he ceased to be aware of them.  The following 
day after a 22 hour surface interval he dived to 25m for 45 min 
with a 3 min stop at 6m.  About an hour after this dive he told 
the boat's skipper that he felt hot and itchy.  He was placed on 
oxygen and diving medical advice was sought.  He was given a 
medical examination and advised that he could be suffering 
from a mild type 1 DCI but did not require recompression 
treatment.  The following day he had a bloated abdomen and 
was taken to hospital by ambulance from where he was later 
discharged.  The diver had been diving on nitrox 27.  
Subsequent tests revealed a large PFO. 
June 2008 08/252 
Three divers planned a 35 min dive to a maximum depth of 
18m.  12 min into the dive the dive leader deployed a delayed 
SMB.  During deployment the line tangled and the diver was 
pulled up to about 12m.  He regained control and re-
descended.  Meanwhile the other two divers had started an 
ascent.  One of these two had difficulty controlling her buoyancy 
and the other tried to slow her ascent.  They passed the dive 
leader and took hold of the SMB line to try to control the ascent.  
The two divers were carried directly to the surface; their dive 
time was 16 min.  The dive leader let go of the SMB reel when it 
was pulled up by the other two and he made a safety stop 
before surfacing, his dive time was 19 min.  The divers were 
recovered into their boat and about 30 min later the diver who 
had had buoyancy problems began to feel unwell.  Initially it 
was thought to be seasickness, but she then developed 
difficulty with speech and a numbness in her tongue and 
fingers.  She was placed on oxygen and the Coastguard 
alerted.  She was airlifted to a recompression chamber and 
treated for DCI. 
June 2008 08/136 
A dive boat reported having a diver onboard suffering a severe 
headache and nausea following a normal dive profile and 
ascent.  Medical advice was taken from a diving doctor who 
recommended evacuation to a hospital for evaluation.  
However, the paramedic on scene considered that they should 
be transferred to a hyperbaric chamber for 
assessment/treatment.  The diver was airlifted by a rescue 
helicopter to a hyperbaric chamber.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2008 08/135 
A diver suffering from DCI was airlifted to a hospital for 
treatment.  (Media report). 
June 2008 08/155 
A diver was engaged in a week of diving.  On the last day he 
dived to 53m and made a 12 min stop at 6m and a 3 min safety 
stop at 3m during his ascent.  After a surface interval of 2 hours 
10 min he dived to 29m for 39 min with a 2 min mandatory plus 
3 min safety stop at 6m.  After this dive he complained of a sore 
left arm which he described as being 'an ache like a pulled 
muscle'.   He also had a multicoloured rash on this arm.  He 
was placed on oxygen and given fluids.  After 10 min on oxygen 
the rash eased.  Diving medical advice was sought and it was 
recommended that he remain on oxygen for 30 min.  No further 
treatment was required and the diver made a full recovery. 
June 2008 08/156 
Three divers using rebreathers conducted a dive to a maximum 
depth of 46m.  They spent 32 min at a depth of 43m.  They 
made a slow ascent with the following stops: 2 min at 30m, 2 
min at 22m, 2 min at 18m, 2 min at 9m and 16 min at 6m.  Once 
out of the water one of the three went to the toilet to urinate.  
Immediately after this he started to experience stomach cramps 
and lower back pain.  5 min later his vision became blurred.  He 
was placed on oxygen and his buddies packed the equipment 
away while he rested.  They then sought diving medical advice 
and were told that his symptoms indicated DCI and that he 
should make his way to the nearest A&E hospital.  On the way 
he developed 'pins and needles' and an ache in his elbow.  
After an examination he was taken by ambulance to a 
recompression facility for treatment which resolved his 
symptoms.

Three divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 27m.  
During the ascent one of the three lost control of his buoyancy 
and made a rapid, feet first, ascent from 10m.  His dive duration 
was 35 min.  At the surface he developed a pain in his shoulder 
and felt nauseous.  He was placed on oxygen and the 
Coastguard was alerted.  The diver was airlifted to a 
recompression chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2008 08/139 
A diver made a rapid ascent after being stung by a jellyfish.  
The diver developed signs of DCI and the Coastguard was 
alerted.  A boat was used to transfer the diver to a 
recompression facility but it broke down on the way.  The diver 
was eventually treated for DCI and the sting.

Dive support vessel contacted Belfast Coastguard reporting 
having a diver aboard suffering post dive symptoms of DCI.  
Rescue helicopter R-118 recovered the diver and transported to 
Craigavon chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2008 08/211 
A diver engaged in a series of dives over a six day period.  On 
the first day she experienced a severe pain in her left breast 
which spread during the lunch period to include both breasts.  
Others suggested that it might be a muscle strain but the diver 
was not convinced.  The pain felt like a deep itch an inch into 
the breast tissue; it faded overnight.  Three days later a rash 
appeared on top of her left breast about 2 hours after a dive; it 
disappeared overnight.  The following day she only dived in the 
afternoon.  The dive was on nitrox 28 to 27m for 50 min with a 8 
min decompression stop of which 3 min was a safety stop.  
Within an hour of surfacing she experienced a severe pain in 
her left breast and the skin was red.  On return to shore she 
sought medical advice and was placed on oxygen.  She went to 
a recompression facility and received treatment for DCI.  The 
following day she had some residual tenderness. 
July 2008 08/304 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 29m.  One 
was using open circuit air and the other a rebreather.  They 
started their ascent after 34 min.  The rebreather diver's 
computer indicated minimal decompression while the air diver's 
computer showed the need for 20 min of decompression stop.  
Decompression actually took longer than indicated and they 
surfaced after a total dive time of 74 min.  Once ashore the 
rebreather diver complained of chest and stomach pains; he 
was placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  The 
diver was airlifted to a recompression facility where he received 
recompression treatment.  DCI was thought to have been 
unlikely but his symptoms were resolved by recompression, so 
it remained a possibility.  It was subsequently determined that 
the decompression took longer than the computer indicated 
since the divers stopped at 6m and the computer based its 
prediction on a stop at 3m. 
July 2008 08/141 
A diver using air conducted a 58 min dive to a depth of 46m.  
On leaving the water he noticed a slight pain in his left elbow 
which then subsided; he put this down to a muscular strain.  
Later that day he conducted a drift dive to a maximum depth of 
30m for a duration of 33 min.  On surfacing from this second 
dive the pain returned and became severe as he climbed the 
ladder.  He was placed on oxygen and given fluids.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and the diver was airlifted to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  The diver subsequently 
reported that he had a metal pin in the affected area of his left 
elbow.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2008 08/142 
A diver using air conducted a dive to 18m for 53 min including a 
3 min safety stop at 6m.  2 hours later he conducted a drift dive 
to a maximum depth of 18m for 45 min with a 3 min safety stop 
at 6m.  About 5 min after he had got back into the boat he felt a 
pain in his right shoulder.  The pain subsided and was then 
replaced by a tingling pain in both shoulders.  He was placed on 
nitrox 80 and the Coastguard was alerted.  He was airlifted to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2008 08/354 
Following two 23m dives a diver complained of joint pain in arm 
and legs also suffering light-headedness. Coastguard rescue 
helicopter R-100 recovered the diver and transferred to 
Dunstaffnage for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2008 08/254 
Two divers using air conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 
32m.  One of the pair had his computer incorrectly set to nitrox 
32 and when it cleared at 6m he left his buddy and surfaced.  
His total dive duration was 58 min including a 1 min stop at 9m 
and a 1 min stop at 6m.  The diver was placed on oxygen and 
the Coastguard was alerted.  The diver was taken by 
ambulance to a recompression facility for treatment for DCI.  
The buddy completed his stops and surfaced without adverse 
effects. 
July 2008 08/291 
An instructor conducted a 20 min dive to a maximum depth of 
6m.  The dive consisted of repeated ascents and descents to 
6m.  After the dive he noticed a tingling sensation in his right 
arm.  He was placed on oxygen and diving medical advice was 
sought.  His condition worsened and he was airlifted to a 
recompression facility. 
July 2008 08/166 
A diver using a drysuit for the first time dived to 23m for 33 min. 
Then, after a surface interval of 1 hour 55 min, he dived to 19m 
for 36 min.  The following day he felt an ache in his shoulders 
and hip and a slight tingling in his left hand and arm.  He also 
had a rash over his shoulders.  He thought that these 
symptoms were due to the previous day's exertion and to lying 
on his arm.  The following day the symptoms remained and he 
contacted his doctor.  His doctor could not help so he sought 
diving medical advice.  He attended a recompression chamber 
where he received treatment for DCI. 
July 2008 08/359 
Clyde Coastguard was alerted to a diver suffering DCI following 
a dive to 105m, 13min bottom time 3 hours deco. The diver 
made surface OK then complained of pains in the knee and 
'pins and needles' in lower leg. The casualty was transferred to 
Dunstaffnage for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2008 08/255 
A diver felt seasick before a dive.  He entered the water and 
waited at the top of the shotline for 10 min to recover.  He felt fit 
to dive and he and his buddy descended to a wreck in a 
maximum depth of 32m.  On the bottom he did not feel right and 
signalled his buddy to ascend.  They ascended a few metres 
and waited there for about 10 min after which the diver felt that 
he could continue.  They re-descended and moved along the 
wreck.  The diver then became concerned that his fingers and 
toes were cold and he signalled to his buddy that he wanted to 
ascend.  They returned to the shotline and when the diver 
moved into a vertical position he was sick.  His regulator came 
out of his mouth and his vomit in the water obscured his vision.  
His buddy put his regulator back into his mouth but he had 
swallowed a lot of water.  He was sick into the regulator and 
this inhibited his breathing.  He changed to his alternative 
regulator, then changed back when this too became filled with 
vomit.  The pair made a rapid ascent to the surface and were 
recovered into the boat.  The sick diver was placed on oxygen 
and the Coastguard was alerted.  The diver was taken by 
ambulance and helicopter to hospital and a recompression 
facility where he was treated for DCI.  He subsequently tested 
negative for a PFO.  This was this diver's first dive to deeper 
than 20m in the UK. 
July 2008 08/175 
Two divers dived to a maximum depth of 25m.  At the start of 

  ` NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2008

the dive they deployed an SMB.  When one of the pair reached 
50 bar they started their ascent.  They made a stop at about 6m 
but surfaced with 2 min of stops outstanding.  Part of the ascent 
was fast and the diver who first reached 50 bar had to switch to 
his pony cylinder.  Once in the boat this diver was placed on 
oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  The diver was airlifted 
to a recompression facility where he found to be very confused.  
The diver stated that he suffered from cerebral palsy.  He was 
treated for DCI.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2008 08/216 
A diver conducted a 40 min dive to a maximum depth of 22m.  
Later the same day he dived to 28m for 36 min.  Both dives 
included a 3 min safety stop at 6m.  Some time after the second 
dive the diver developed a slight pain and a skin rash on his 
right shoulder.  He was first placed on nitrox 50 then, 20 min 
later, on oxygen.  He was given water to drink.  The Coastguard 
was alerted and the diver was airlifted to a recompression 
facility for treatment. 
July 2008 08/215 
A diver conducted a 47 min dive to a maximum depth of 41m 
including a 2 min stop at 8m.  1 hour 57 min later he dived to 
46m for 36 min including a 4 min stop at 7m.  Shortly after 
getting back in the boat he felt a pain in his right shoulder but 
put it down to a strain.  The pain developed across his lower 
back and then across his stomach.  He lay down but the 
symptoms remained.  He then felt a tingling feeling down his 
right leg and it became very sensitive to touch; a similar feeling 
then developed in his left leg.  He was placed on oxygen and 
the Coastguard was alerted.  He was taken by lifeboat to a 
recompression facility and treated for DCI. 
July 2008 08/361 
Yarmouth Coastguard received a call from a dive support 
vessel reporting having a diver aboard suffering from suspected 
DCI.  The casualty was met by Happisburg Coastguard Rescue 
Team and an ambulance for transportation to hospital.  
(Coastguard report). 
July 2008 08/172 
A pair of divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 
45m using air.  Their ascent included a 10 min stop at 10m and 
a 31 min stop at 5m; during the 10m stop one of the pair lost 
sight in one eye.  He took hold of his buddy and after about 1 
min his vision returned.  At the surface the diver who had had 
the temporary loss of sight had pains in his left arm; he thought 
these pains were a result of gripping his buddy very hard.  
These divers did not report the incident to the dive manager at 
this time.  Their total dive duration was 57 min.  Once back on 
shore the diver still had arm pains and he placed himself on 
oxygen for 40 min as a precaution.  At this point the dive 
manager was informed of the problem.  The following morning 
the pain had returned in his left arm together with a mottling of 
the skin and he did not have full use of the arm.  The 
Coastguard was contacted and the diver and his buddy went to 
a recompression facility.  The diver received three sessions of 
recompression therapy.  The diver had had previous DCI 
incidents. 
July 2008 08/178 
Two divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 
28m.  They deployed a delayed SMB to make their ascent and 
as they started to move upwards one of the pair lost control of 
his buoyancy and made a rapid ascent to the surface arriving 
feet first.  His buddy lost his regulator and inhaled some water.  
He then panicked, lost control of his buoyancy too and made a 
rapid ascent to the surface.  Their dive duration was 20 min.  
The Coastguard was alerted and both divers were airlifted to a 
recompression facility.  The second diver developed a slight 
numbness in his left hand.  Both divers were more accustomed 
to fresh water diving and both were under-weighted.  
(Coastguard report). 
July 2008 08/362 
Portland Coastguard was contacted by a dive support vessel 
reporting having a diver aboard suffering from suspected DCI, 
the diver was transferred by ambulance to Poole recompression 
chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2008 08/363 
Solent Coastguard was alerted by a dive support vessel to a 
diver aboard suffering suspected DCI, and the casualty being 
administered oxygen.  Rescue helicopter R-106 recovered 
casualty from vessel and airlifted to Poole General hospital for 
treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2008 08/173 
A diver conducted a 38 min dive to 30m including a 1 min stop 
at 12m and a 3 min stop at 5m using nitrox 32.  2 hours 15 min 
later he dived to a maximum depth of 29m.  During the ascent 
from this second dive, at a depth of 23m, the diver started to 
deploy a delayed SMB.  As the SMB inflated the diver rose up 
with it.  He re-descended to 23m and continued to fill the buoy.  
He ascended again to about 18m at which point he let go of the 
SMB and re-descended to 20m.  He then made a normal 
ascent with a 4 min stop at 5m.  His total dive duration was 39 
min.  About 1 hour later this diver complained of feeling dizzy 
and having blurred vision and he was sick.  He was placed on 
oxygen and then taken by ambulance to a recompression 
facility for treatment. 
July 2008 08/174 
Milford Haven Coastguard received a call from a dive support 
vessel reporting a diver aboard suffering from suspected DCI 
following a dive to 52m, the casualty was airlifted by RAF R-169 
to Poole recompression chamber.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2008 08/177 
A diver conducted a 30 min dive to a maximum depth of 27m.  
10 min after leaving the water she started to feel very seasick.  
She then developed a loss of feeling and 'pins and needles' in 
her hands.  She was placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was 
alerted.  The diver was airlifted to a recompression facility 
where she was treated for DCI.  No causal factors were 
identified.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2008 08/176 
Falmouth Coastguard scrambled Royal Navy helicopter R-193 
to airlift a diving casualty suffering from suspected DCI to 
DDRC Plymouth.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2008 08/226 
Two divers conducted a normal dive to a maximum depth of 
29m for a duration of 38 min including a 2 min stop at 18m and 
a 6 min stop at 6m.  Shortly after getting back into the boat one 
of the pair began to experience painful abdominal cramps.  He 
thought that it was trapped wind but a few minutes later he felt 
'pins and needles' in his arms and fingers.  He was placed on 
oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  The casualty was 
taken by lifeboat and ambulance to hospital.  The casualty 
developed leg spasms, hypersensitivity around his midriff and 
difficulty urinating; his abdominal pains eased with the 
application of oxygen.  He was diagnosed with a spinal DCI and

received a series of three sessions of recompression treatment 
over a period of three days.  Minor residual symptoms remained 
at the time of reporting and further medical advice was being 
sought.  It was thought that dehydration may have played a part 
in this DCI. 
August 2008 08/367 
Forth Coastguard was asked for medical advice for a diver 
suffering from suspected DCI, the casualty was transferred to 
A&E by ambulance for observation.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2008 08/182 
Two divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 
30m.  They deployed a delayed SMB to make their ascent and 
at 6m they halted to conduct a planned 3 min safety stop.  At 
this point one of the pair noticed that the SMB line was caught 
on the regulator 'A' clamp of the other diver.  He moved to 
release it and while doing so they both lost control of their 
buoyancy and dropped back to 14m.  They re-ascended to 6m 
but then dropped again to 8m.  From this point they ascended 
to the surface.  One of the pair was shaken by these events and 
did not feel right.  Both were placed on oxygen for about 30 min 
as a precaution.  Neither diver dived again that day.  The 
following day they drove home and the diver who had felt unwell 
after the subject dive developed a headache, became 
lightheaded and had a tingling in his arms.  Over the next few 
days these symptoms did not ease and another diver advised 
him to seek medical advice.  Tests were conducted and the 
diver was then transported to a recompression facility where he 
received a series of three treatments for a neurological DCI.  
This diver had conducted a series of dives in the days 
preceding the subject dive. 
August 2008 08/370 
A diver made a rapid ascent from 60m.  At the surface the diver 
was found to be paralysed and his recovery was made difficult 
because there were other divers in the water.  He was placed 
on oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  The diver was 
airlifted to a recompression facility where he received a series 
of treatments. 
August 2008 08/228 
A diver conducted a 33 min dive to a maximum depth of 38m 
with a 1 min stop at 20m and a 5 min stop at 6m during her 
ascent.  When the boat approached to pick her up she was 
unable to grasp the ladder and she seemed unresponsive and 
unable to help herself.  Other divers removed her kit and lifted 
her into the boat.  She was placed on oxygen and given fluids 
and the Coastguard was alerted.  She complained of a slight 
tingling in her legs and feet.  She was transferred into a lifeboat 
and then airlifted to a recompression facility where she received 
a precautionary treatment.  The diver had had a suspected DCI 
four years previously and a PFO had been diagnosed and 
closed. 
August 2008 08/268 
A diver conducted a 29 min dive to a maximum depth of 26m.  
An hour later he dived again but experienced tooth pain during 
the descent, at a depth of 5m, and he made a rapid ascent to 
the surface.  The following day the diver conducted a dive to a 
maximum depth of 25m.  He was using a twin cylinder setup 
with a manifold and two regulators.  The way in which the 
equipment was configured resulted in the second regulator 
being presented over the left shoulder upside down; this was 
not noticed during the pre-dive checks.  After 10 min the diver 
indicated to the dive leader that he had only 50 bar remaining in 
one cylinder; the other one was full.  The dive leader thought 
that the manifold had been opened at the start of the dive.  He 
indicated to the diver to use his second regulator (attached to 
the full cylinder).  The diver found this difficult to breathe from 
and indicated that he wanted to use the dive leader's alternative 
air source.  She gave this to him and they started to ascend 
from 22m.  At 15m they were ascending too rapidly and the dive 
leader dumped all the air in her BCD and indicated to the other 
diver that he should also dump air.  They then started to 
descend rapidly and the dive leader indicated that the other 
diver should fin upwards but he did not respond.  They sank 
back to 20m and the dive leader inflated her BCD.  They started 
to re-ascend, lost control of their buoyancy and made a rapid 
ascent to the surface.  Their dive duration was 13 min.  10 min 
after surfacing the diver who had been low on air developed 
symptoms of DCI.  He was placed on oxygen and the 
Coastguard was alerted.  Both divers were airlifted to a 
recompression facility and the diver with DCI received six 
sessions of recompression treatment over a four day period.  
He made a full recovery.  Subsequent examination of the diver's 
equipment revealed that he had 50 bar in one cylinder, 80 bar 
in the other and they would not equalize when the manifold 
valve was opened. 
August 2008 08/372 
Holyhead Coastguard tasked R-122 helicopter to recover a 
diver suffering from suspected DCI and transport the casualty to

A diver completed a 63 min shore dive to a maximum depth of 
7m.  Later that day he dived to 5m for 45 min.  He developed a 
headache after the first dive and this got worse after the second 
dive and he felt sick.  After the second dive he was very 
confused, weak, disorientated, unable to stand or talk, was 
unresponsive and had difficulty breathing.  The Coastguard was 
alerted and the diver and his buddy were airlifted to a 
recompression facility.  The diver was recompressed and this 
resolved his symptoms.  The diver has a history of migraines.

Swansea Coastguard requested rescue helicopter R-169 to 
evacuate a diver, who had made a rapid ascent from 16m, to 
DDRC Plymouth.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2008 08/244 
A diver conducted three dives over a three day period.  The first 
dive was to 62m for 90 min, the second was to 60m for 85 min 
and the third was to 65m for 85 min.  He used nitrox 34 as his 
travel gas, trimix 18/32 for the dive and nitrox 70 for 
decompression.  On the last dive he left the bottom after 25 min 
and made stops at 42m and 36m, switched to his travel gas and 
made stops at 30m, 24m, 20m, 18m, and 15m, then switched to 
his decompression gas for stops at 12m, 9m and 6m.  He then 
took 5 min to surface from 6m.  Once back in the boat he 
developed a slight cough and he breathed nitrox 70.  He noticed 
some bruising on his chest and abdomen.  That evening he felt 
very tired and he noticed a rash on his stomach before eating 
and going to bed.  The following morning he felt unwell and he 
sought diving medical advice.  He attended a recompression 
facility for treatment for DCI.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2008 08/245 
Two divers conducted a night drift dive in a maximum depth of 
25m.  When they started their ascent one of the pair had 100 
bar remaining.  This diver struggled to get air into his delayed 
SMB and he started to ascend quickly.  He tried to stop his 
ascent but started to panic and breathed deeply.  His computer 
indicated the need for 7 min of decompression and he tried to 
stop at 6m.  At 6m he switched to his pony regulator as he had 
only 30 bar in his main cylinder.  He stopped for 3 min but then 
surfaced.  Back in the boat he was placed on oxygen and the 
boat returned to shore.  The diver developed 'pins and needles' 
in both hands and forearms and he felt dizzy and sick.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and the diver was taken by helicopter 
and ambulance to a recompression facility for treatment for 
DCI.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2008 08/295 
A pair of divers swam down an underwater slope and then, at a 
depth of 22m, they swam off in mid-water.  After a few minutes 
one of the pair started to feel anxious in the increasing dark and 
cold and she started to breathe heavily.  She attracted her 
buddy's attention and indicated that she wanted to ascend.  
During the ascent she lost control of her buoyancy and the 
ascent became rapid.  At the surface she was disorientated, 
unable to control her breathing and she felt weak, dizzy and 
sick.  Shortly after leaving the water she felt worse and she 
developed a tingling in her legs and a headache.  She was 
placed on oxygen.  Diving medical advice was sought and the 
diver was airlifted to a recompression facility for treatment.  She 
was discharged the following day fully recovered. 
August 2008 08/242 
A diver completed a series of four dives over a four day period.  
The first dive was to 68m for a total duration of 148 min, the 
second was to 64m for 126 min, the third was to 66m for 120 
min and the fourth was to 65m for 122 min.  All dives were 
made using a rebreather with a 10/50 trimix diluent.  His set 
point was 1.3 below 6m and 1.5 above 6m for decompression.  
Shortly after his last dive he felt a burning sensation on his 
upper chest and the skin had a rash and was itchy.  He was 
placed on oxygen for 30 min and the rash disappeared but a 
bruising-like pain remained.  Early the following morning he 
awoke to find that his balance was impaired and he felt dizzy.  
He contacted a recompression facility and was advised to go 
there.  He was given recompression treatment and this resolved 
his symptoms apart from some soreness.  The cause of his DCI 
was said to be due to repeated deep dives. 
August 2008 08/380 
Portland Coastguard was contacted by dive support vessel 
requesting medical advice for a diver.  The vessel was placed in 
a connect call with Poole hyperbaric unit after a diver started to 
display possible DCI.  Under advice the diver was kept under 
observation but not taken off the dive vessel.  (Coastguard 
report).

A diver made a rapid ascent from a dive to 30m.  He developed 
a tingling feeling in his arms and, once ashore, he was taken by 
ambulance to hospital.  (Media report). 
August 2008 08/233 
A diver conducted a 35 min dive to a maximum depth of 29m 
with a slow ascent to 6m and a 5 min stop at 6m including a 3 
min safety stop.  Once back in the boat she was seasick 
despite having taken anti-seasickness medication before the 
dive.  Later, during her drive home she noticed a slight rash and 
itchiness to her upper body but thought that this was from 
wearing her drysuit.  Her right arm felt heavy and she had a 
pain in her left knee, she thought these symptoms were due to 
kneeling and leaning over the side of the boat when she was 
sick.  The following morning she found it difficult to put weight 
on her knee and took two paracetamol.  That morning her upper 
right arm was itchy, very swollen and hot.  She sought diving 
medical advice by phone and attended her local hospital.  Some 
weakness was found on her right side, she was placed on 
oxygen and given intravenous fluids.  She was taken to a 
recompression facility where spinal and skin DCIs were 
diagnosed.  She received three sessions of recompression 
treatment and her symptoms were resolved apart from some 
remaining tenderness.  A PFO examination was recommended. 
August 2008 08/383 
Portland Coastguard was contacted retrospectively for medical 
advice by a diver having made a 65m dive 85min submerged 
duration.  The casualty was treated at Poole recompression 
chamber.  (Coastguard report).

Dive support vessel contacted Falmouth Coastguard requesting 
medical advice for a diver suffering from suspected DCI 
following a dive to 32m.  A medical connect call was 
established with DDRC Plymouth, the advice dictated an 
evacuation to the chamber at DDRC, Naval Rescue helicopter 
R-193 airlifted the casualty.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2008 08/296 
A pair of divers completed a 24 min dive to a maximum depth of 
20m.  At the end of the dive they made a surface swim to the 
exit point.  During this swim one of the pair got cramp in his leg 
and his buddy started to tow him.  The diver with cramp then 
became unresponsive and the other diver called for assistance.  
The diver was recovered from the water and found to be 
unconscious but breathing.  He was placed on oxygen and the 
emergency services were alerted.  The diver started to recover 
but was paralysed down his right-hand side.  Diving medical 
advice was sought.  The diver was taken by ambulance to 
hospital and from there to a recompression facility.  He received 
two sessions of recompression treatment for DCI.  Initially he 
was thought to have had a stroke but it was diagnosed as a 
cerebral embolism potentially exacerbated by hypothermia.  
The diver was using a membrane drysuit but had forgotten his 
undersuit so he dived without it.  It is also believed that he had 
not been wearing a hood.

recompression facility.  (Media report). 
September 2008 08/257 
A rebreather diver conducted a series of dives over a number of 
days culminating in a dive to 42m.  Ascending from this dive he 
made a 2 min stop at 24m, a 2 min stop at 16m and a 5 min 
stop at 6m.  At the 6m stop his rebreather computer cleared its 
stop requirements after 2 min and his dive computer cleared 
after a further 1 min.  He stayed at the stop for a total of 5 min 
while his buddy's computer cleared.  About 10 min after 
surfacing he began to feel dizzy and his right ear felt blocked.  
He moved to the side of the boat to be sick but his dizziness 
made him stumble and he hit and cut his head on a railing.  He 
was sick for about 10 min and then he was placed on oxygen.  
The Coastguard was alerted and the boat directed to 
rendezvous with a lifeboat.  The boat made harbour before 
meeting the lifeboat and the diver was taken by ambulance to 
hospital.  The diver was then transferred by ambulance to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  A vestibular DCI was 
diagnosed and he received two sessions of recompression 
treatment.  He was then flown to another recompression facility 
for two further sessions of treatment.  At the time of reporting he 
had some residual dizziness and was seeking further medical 
treatment. 
September 2008 08/259 
A diver using air conducted a 30 min dive to a maximum depth 
of 27m.  4 hours later she dived to 20m for 36 min.   After this 
dive she became nauseous, had a weakness on her right-hand 
side, had right shoulder pain and nystagmus.  The Coastguard 
was alerted and the diver was airlifted to a recompression 
facility for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2008 08/261 
A diver conducted a 30 min dive to 33m and then a 36 min dive 
to 25m.  The following day she dived to 33m for 38 min 
including a 1 min stop at 16m, a 1 min stop at 10m and a 3 min 
stop at 6m.  At this last stop she felt nauseous.  Once back in 
the boat her nausea increased and she developed a pain in her 
right forearm.  She was placed on oxygen and the Coastguard 
was alerted.  The diver was airlifted to a recompression 
chamber for treatment.  It is thought that dehydration may have 
been a causal factor.  (Coastguard report).

A diver with suspected DCI was taken by ambulance and 
lifeboat to a recompression facility for treatment.  (Media 
report). 
September 2008 08/271 
A diver using a trimix rebreather conducted a 60m dive for 105 
min.  The following day he repeated this profile.  The day after 
that he dived to 62m for 105 min.  Shortly after surfacing from 
this dive he developed a skin rash across his abdomen, he was 
nauseous and vomiting.  The Coastguard was alerted and the 
diver was airlifted to a recompression facility for treatment.  At 
the chamber he had pain in his upper arms and a tightness in 
his chest.  He was given recompression treatment and 
responded well.  This diver had had two similar problems in the 
previous two years.

Injury / Illness 
 
 
October 2007  08/010 
A diver completed a 21 min dive to a maximum depth of 10m.  
After the dive he complained of tingling in his arms.  He had 
numbness in his lips and he was sick.  The Coastguard was 
alerted and the boat returned to shore.  Once ashore the diver 
was taken by ambulance to hospital.  It was thought that this 
may have been a non-diving related illness. (Coastguard report). 
October 2007 08/014 
The Coastguard was alerted when a diver complained of feeling 
unwell.  He was taken by ambulance to a medical facility.  
(Coastguard report). 
October 2007 08/017 
A group of diver were recovering an RHIB onto its trailer.  While 
they were lining the boat up with the trailer a series of waves hit 
them making the task difficult.  They decided to abandon the 
attempt and to recover the RHIB in a nearby marina.  Further 
waves then knocked the trailer half off the slipway.  The driver 
became concerned about the safety of the car and unhooked the 
trailer.  One person took hold of the recovery strap and another 
held the trailer.  A larger wave then washed the trailer completely 
off the slipway and it started to roll down the beach.  A finger of 
the diver who was holding the strap became trapped in the hook 
at the end of the strap and he was dragged down the beach 
injuring his finger.  He attended hospital for this injury and was 
treated for a broken finger and damaged ligaments. 
October 2007 08/418 
A diver had completed a shallow training dive when she 
developed a pain in both knees.  She was placed on oxygen and 
taken by ambulance to hospital.  She was discharged, fully 
recovered, later that day.

Two lifeboats launched to help diver(s) with illness.  Person(s) 
brought in.  (RNLI report). 
November 2007 08/039 
Two divers entered a quarry to make a dive to a maximum depth 
of 26m.  They made a surface swim to the planned dive site.  
One of the pair noticed that she was lower than usual in the 
water even with her BCD fully inflated.  When they started the 
dive she felt that she was descending quicker than normal.  She 
tried putting air into her drysuit but it did not slow her descent.  
As she descended she became concerned that she was going 
much deeper than planned and she started to panic.  She 
grabbed hold of a rock wall at 18m and signalled to her buddy 
that she wanted to ascend.  She put more air into her suit but 
continued to descend when she released her hold on the wall.  
She started to hyperventilate.  Her buddy reached down and 
grabbed her hand.  They reached the bottom at 25m and the 
heavy diver started to lose consciousness.  Her buddy inflated 
his drysuit to bring them to the surface but lost his grip on her 
and made a buoyant ascent to the surface.  The heavy diver 
sank back down and the regulator came out of her mouth.  
Another diver was returning from a deep dive and was making a 
decompression stop in the same area.  This diver chanced upon 
the unconscious diver lying on the bottom at 28m, about 1m from 
a steep slope down to 60m.  This diver released her weights and 
inflated her BCD, sending her to the surface.  She surfaced close 
to her buddy who started towing her ashore.  Other divers on the 
shore realised that there was a problem and went to assist.  
They brought the casualty to the shore giving rescue breaths on 
the way.  Once out of the water they administer CPR and oxygen 
assisted rescue breaths.  After about 7 min the casualty regained 
consciousness.  The emergency services were alerted and the 
diver was airlifted to a recompression facility for precautionary 
treatment; from there she was taken to hospital from where she 
was released 3 days later.  Subsequent examination of the 
diver's drysuit dump valve indicated that it may not have been 
adequately closed.

A diver had completed a dive and was leaving the water by 
walking up a slipway.  He was wearing a rebreather and a side- 
slung cylinder.  He slipped, fell over and hurt his left ankle and 
foot.  It is thought that he was wearing fins.  He was taken to 
hospital where a bad sprain was diagnosed. 
January 2008 08/041 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 20m in a 
quarry.  One of the pair was using a borrowed membrane 
drysuit.  At the end of the dive they made a normal ascent to the 
surface and swam towards the side.  Their dive duration was 20 
min.  As they neared the exit point the diver in the membrane 
suit became increasingly cold and started to panic.  A boat went 
to their assistance.  The diver was having difficulty breathing and 
complained of extreme cold.  She was recovered from the water 
and brought ashore.  Her condition did not improve and the 
emergency services were alerted.  The diver was taken by 
ambulance to hospital from where she was released later that 
day. 
January 2008 08/062 
Two rebreather divers approached a diving club seeking 
permission to use their pool during one of the club's pool nights 
to practise drills with their rebreathers.  One of the rebreather 
divers had just completed a training course for his equipment; 
the other had many hours experience on his rebreather.  During 
their practice, at a depth of 4m, the more experienced rebreather 
diver noticed that his newly qualified buddy was exhibiting 
unusual behaviour and then appeared to blackout.  The 
mouthpiece fell from his mouth and the rebreather flooded.  The 
buddy brought the unconscious diver to the surface using his 
own buoyancy.  At the surface two instructors from the host club 
helped to support the casualty and, assisted by a further 
instructor from another group who were also using the pool, they 
recovered the casualty from the water.  He was not breathing 
and resuscitation techniques were applied.  After a short period 
the casualty started to breathe, he was placed on oxygen and he 
recovered consciousness.  The emergency services were alerted 
and the casualty was taken by ambulance to hospital from where 
he was released the following day.  He remembered a feeling of 
falling asleep underwater.  During the session the diver had left 
the water to adjust the configuration of his equipment and he had

turned off the oxygen supply while he did so.  He had forgotten to 
turn it back on again when he re-entered the water.  The 
instrumentation of this particular system flashes a red indicator if 
the oxygen partial pressure is below 1 bar; hence, at the surface, 
it would be normal for it to indicate red whether the oxygen was 
turned on or not.  The number and duration of the flashes 
indicates the actual oxygen partial pressure. 
February 2008 08/065 
A trainee snorkel diver conducted a 'duck dive' in a swimming 
pool in a depth of 2.5m.  He descended rapidly and hit his head 
on the pool bottom.  He was assessed at the time and felt fit to 
continue the training session.  The following day he felt unwell 
and attended his local hospital.  He was treated for mild 
concussion. 
February 2008 08/046 
Three divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 20m.  At 
the end of the dive they deployed a delayed SMB to make their 
ascent.  At 6m one of the three was too buoyant and struggled to 
stay down.  One of the others tried to assist him but he made a 
rapid inverted ascent to the surface.  His dive duration was 27 
min.  The boat party saw the diver motionless at the surface and 
moved quickly to recover him.  He was conscious but dazed and 
breathless.  He was placed on oxygen and a 999 call was made 
for an ambulance to meet the boat at the harbour.  The other 
divers were recovered and the boat started back.  The diver 
started to convulse and passed in and out of consciousness.  
Once ashore the diver was taken to a recompression facility for 
treatment.  He was discharged the following day symptom-free. 
February 2008 08/047 
A diver and an instructor made a dive to a maximum depth of 
21m, in a quarry, to conduct SMB training.  The trainee began to 
wind in the line to make an ascent then became confused and 
dumped air from his BCD instead of inflating it.  He seemed 
incapable of rectifying the situation and the instructor abandoned 
the reel and brought him to the surface using her own BCD.  At 
the surface she inflated his BCD and started towing him to the 
side.  Once out of the water the divers were both placed on 
oxygen.  No subsequent ill effects were reported.  The instructor 
suggested that the diver had been affected by narcosis. 
February 2008 08/063 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 27m.  
During the ascent one of the pair lost control of his buoyancy and 
made a rapid ascent to the surface; his buddy tried to slow the 
ascent but was carried up too.  Their dive duration was 18 min 
and they had missed an indicated 2 min decompression stop.  
Back in the boat the buddy complained of a pain in his ears.  
Both divers were placed on oxygen; no other symptoms 
developed.  The following day the diver with ear pain visited his 
doctor and a burst eardrum was diagnosed.  The trip to the dive 
site was made in an RHIB in cold weather and the diver who had 
made the rapid ascent had worn additional clothing under his 
drysuit.  He had not weighted himself correctly for the additional 
buoyancy. 
February 2008 08/052 
Two divers entered the water for a dive; one of them was using a 
rebreather.  They had been underwater for about 5 min, at a 
depth of 6m, when one of them realised that the other, the 
rebreather diver, was no longer with him.  He backtracked and 
found the missing diver on his back with his regulator out of his 
mouth.  He brought him to the surface and raised the alarm.  He 
gave two rescue breaths before a rescue boat arrived.  Once out 
of the water the casualty was found not to be breathing.  
Resuscitation techniques were applied and the emergency 
services were called.  He was taken by ambulance to hospital 
where he began a recovery. 
March 2008 08/058 
Two divers conducted a shore dive to a maximum depth of 10m.  
After 22 min they surfaced briefly to check their location.  After a 
further 5 min one of the pair got cramp in her leg and they lost 
direction again so they surfaced once more.  They found that 
they were further away from their exit point than they expected 
and the diver's cramp got worse.  They started to swim back on 
the surface.  The buddy tried to tow the diver with cramp, but she 
tired and became very cold.  They signalled for help and 
continued their swim.  After a further 10 min the buddy lost her 
fin.  Two members of the party snorkelled out from the shore and 
assisted them back.  The Coastguard was alerted, a lifeboat was 
tasked to assist, an ambulance was called for the cold diver and 
she was treated for hypothermia. 
March 2008 08/082 
Two divers dived to a maximum depth of 12m.  One of the pair 
became inverted and lost his regulator.  They began a buoyant 
ascent during which they separated at about 8m.  The buddy 
surfaced shortly afterwards having inflated his BCD and he was 
able to right the troubled diver.  The buddy towed the diver 
ashore and contacted the Coastguard.  A helicopter was tasked 
to support. 
March 2008 08/321 
Clyde Coastguard was alerted to a diver feeling unwell following 
a tooth extraction and having taken antibiotics, administered 
oxygen.  Oban team and ambulance attended.  (Coastguard 
report). 
April 2008 08/280 
A pair of divers conducted a 27 min dive to a maximum depth of 
6m.  1 hour 34 min later they dived to 6m for 20 min.  Once out 
of the water they started to de-kit and while doing so the back of 
one of the divers went into a spasm.  Diving medical advice was 
sought and it was not thought to be a diving related problem.  
The diver was advised to contact his local doctor. 
April 2008 08/325 
Clyde Coastguard assisted a diver to obtain treatment.  Clyde 
Coastguard tasked Largs lifeboat to transfer the casualty to 
Millport Pier, where Cumbrae Coastguard assisted.  (Coastguard 
report). 
April 2008 08/398 
Lifeboat launched to help diver with illness.  (RNLI report). 
April 2008 08/281 
A pair of divers conducted a 38 min dive to a maximum depth of 
32m in a quarry.  Later that day they dived to 22m for 29 min.  At 
the surface after this dive one of the pair was exhausted and 
unable to swim back to the shore.  They called for help and a 
boat was used to bring them ashore.  The diver was found to be 
totally exhausted and unable to help herself.  She had not eaten 
that day but had drunk large amounts of coffee.  She was given 
oxygen and water and advised to rehydrate herself. 
May 2008 08/073 
Male diver who had been recovered unconscious on the surface 
following a shallow dive.  This was his first dive for a year.  As 
soon as he descended his drysuit inflation valve opened and 
poured air into his drysuit, but his new neck seal didn't give

thereby putting pressure on the carotid and windpipe.  He 
resurfaced and was able to shout for assistance before coming 
unconscious.  When the neck seal was loosened he recovered 
consciousness.  He was transferred to hospital for initial 
treatment and later transferred to a specialist hospital following 
suspected heart problems.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2008 08/283 
A trainee and an instructor dived to a maximum depth of 9m.  At 
5m the trainee panicked and she surfaced alone close to a jetty.  
She was seen by divers on the jetty and then she started to sink 
back down without her regulator in her mouth.  Two divers 
entered the water from the jetty and brought her back to the 
surface and then removed her from the water.  The diver was 
cyanosed and unwell.  She was placed on oxygen and the 
emergency services were alerted.  The diver was taken by 
ambulance to hospital from where she was discharged the 
following day. 
May 2008 08/331 
Diver had an onset of chest and diaphragm pain after boarding 
the dive boat, and decided not to dive, he had been diving the 
previous afternoon.  Following an ECG by the ambulance crew 
who attended him, the results of which they were not happy with, 
the diver was transported to hospital for further investigation.  
(Coastguard report). 
May 2008 08/196 
A diver was helping to recover an RHIB onto a trailer.  The winch 
line became disconnected and the diver reconnected it.  A large 
wave then caused the boat to slide backwards pulling on the 
winch line.  The diver had not locked the winch and the handle 
spun round hitting him in the face.  He attended hospital where 
ten stitches were required to close the wound. 
May 2008 08/284 
A diver was on a quayside preparing to enter the water.  He was 
using a 15l cylinder and it slipped from the clamping band.  The 
effort required to resolve this problem combined with the hot 
conditions on the day and a feeling of dehydration caused him to 
collapse and he fell down.  He was given oxygen. 
May 2008 08/092 
After a dive a diver complained of pain in his elbow joint.  He was 
placed on oxygen but this did not affect the symptoms.  The diver 
refused further treatment or diving medical support. 
May 2008 08/094 
A rebreather diver descended to a wreck in a maximum depth of 
40m.  During his descent he felt a 'pop' in his ear but 
experienced no pain.  Upon surfacing he was found to be 
bleeding heavily from his ear.  He was taken to hospital where a 
ruptured ear drum was diagnosed. 
May 2008 08/265 
A pair of divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 33m.  
After 31 min they made their ascent including a 3 min safety stop 
at 6m.  15 min after surfacing one of the pair began to feel dizzy 
and unsteady.  The diver had had similar symptoms on a 
previous occasion and at that time the problem was not found to 
be diving related.  It was thought that this was another 
occurrence of the same problem.  The diver was taken home 
and later he made contact with a recompression facility for 
advice.  He attended the facility and was given recompression 
treatment.  It was unclear if this was DCI. 
May 2008 08/127 
An instructor and a trainee started their descent.  At 3m the 
instructor noticed that the trainee's mask was flooding.  The 
trainee was indicating a problem with her ear and attempting to 
equalise the pressure.  While trying to deal with these problems 
the trainee did not put air into her BCD and thus continued to 
descend.  At 6m the instructor took hold of the trainee and 
inflated her BCD for her.  At the surface the instructor signalled 
for assistance and they were recovered into the boat.  The 
trainee was placed on oxygen and her condition monitored.  The 
trainee developed a headache and discomfort in her neck and 
shoulders.  The Coastguard was alerted and the boat returned to 
harbour from where the trainee was taken by ambulance to a 
recompression facility.  Barotrauma to both ears was diagnosed; 
no recompression was required.

Lifeboat launched to help diver with illness.  (RNLI report). 
June 2008 08/287 
A trainee and an instructor conducted a 32 min dive to a 
maximum depth of 8m.  Later that day they dived to a maximum 
depth of 6m.  During this dive the trainee felt breathless and 
made a rapid ascent to the surface.  His dive duration was 9 min.  
Once out of the water he was placed on oxygen but his condition 
caused concern and diving medical advice was sought.  
Recompression was recommended and a helicopter was tasked 
to transport the diver.  However, he refused to go into the 
helicopter and would not go to hospital.  He was checked and no 
signs of DCI were found.  The following day he went to see his 
doctor.  He was given an inhaler and advised to lose some 
weight.  This diver is a type 2 diabetic with slight asthma, but he 
had a doctor's statement that he was fit to dive. 
June 2008 08/204 
A diver completed a 34 min dive to a maximum depth of 11m.  
When he surfaced he was breathless, grey in colour, had blue 
lips and he began to vomit.  He was placed on oxygen and his 
condition improved.  The boat returned to shore and a 999 call 
was made.  The diver was taken by ambulance to hospital. 
June 2008 08/345 
A dive boat reported having recovered a diver onboard with 
signs of a suspected heart attack after he surfaced unconscious 
and not breathing.   He was given basic life support by the boat 
crew until he was transferred to the lifeboat.  After medical 
advice from a hyperbaric chamber, the diver was airlifted by a 
rescue helicopter to hospital for treatment.  (Coastguard & RNLI 
reports). 
June 2008 08/406 
Lifeboat launched to help diver with illness.  (RNLI report). 
June 2008 08/288 
A trainee and an instructor conducted a 20 min dive to a 
maximum depth of 7m.  About 15 min after the dive the trainee 
complained of irritation in her knees and elbows.  Diving medical 
advice was sought.  The diver was advised to get out of her suit, 
drink plenty of fluids and relax for 15 min and then spend 1 hour 
on oxygen.  She did this and her symptoms resolved.  After 
further diving medical advice she went home.  The diver had 
previously received recompression treatment after a series of 
pool training sessions. 
July 2008 08/137 
An instructor and a number of trainees were engaged in a diving

course at a depth of 20m.  One of the trainees had a problem 
and while that was being resolved another of the trainees 
suddenly became unresponsive.  He was brought to the surface 
by a controlled buoyant lift.  Throughout this time he had his 
regulator in his mouth and appeared to be breathing.  At the 
surface the alarm was raised and the diver was recovered into a 
boat.  Resuscitation techniques were applied and the emergency 
services were alerted.  The casualty was successfully 
resuscitated and then airlifted to hospital.  It is thought that he 
had a heart attack underwater and possibly a second one in the 
boat.  He was reported to be making a good recovery. 
July 2008 08/213 
A diver completed a dive and entered the boat via a dive lift.  She 
was fully kitted as she stepped down into the boat.  She slipped 
and badly injured her ankle.  The Coastguard was alerted and 
the diver was airlifted to hospital where she was treated for a 
broken ankle. 
July 2008 08/358 
Shetland Coastguard was alerted to a diver having surfaced 
unconscious following a dive, CPR was performed and the 
casualty was transferred to an ambulance on arrival in harbour, 
treatment continued and the casualty was believed to be stable.  
(Coastguard report). 
July 2008 08/214 
Three divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 
18m.  As they surfaced one of the three experienced ear pain 
and they re-descended to 15m.  The diver indicated to the dive 
leader that the pain had gone but all was not well with her ears.  
They ascended again and at 10m the diver experienced pain 
again and re-descended to 18m.  One of the other divers then 
indicated that he had only 30 bar remaining.  The dive leader 
then lifted the diver with the ear problem to 6m pinching her nose 
as he did so.  They conducted a 5 min stop at 6m and blood was 
seen to be coming from the nose of the diver with the ear 
problem; it is thought that her ear drum had ruptured at this time.  
The diver who was low on air ran out during the stop and he 
used the dive leader's octopus regulator.  Once back in the boat 
they made a 'Pan Pan' call and alerted the Coastguard.  Once 
ashore the diver was taken to hospital and a perforated eardrum, 
due to reversed ear, was diagnosed.  The diver was given 
antibiotics.  She had used a nasal spray 2 hours before the dive 
and it was suggested that the effects of this may have worn off 
during the dive and allowed mucus to build up in her Eustachian 
tube. 
August 2008 08/164 
After a dive time of 10 min a diver surfaced from a wreck in a 
maximum depth of 28m and gave an emergency signal to the 
boat.  The boat approached and found three divers at the 
surface, two upright in the water and a third lying flat.  The third 
diver was seen to be very blue and hardly breathing.  A crew 
member climbed down onto the dive lift to assist in the removal 
of the casualty's equipment and he was then lifted into the boat.  
Once in the boat the casualty was found to be heavily cyanosed 
and breathing poorly.  A resuscitation bag mask was used to 
assist his breathing and once he had settled into a better rhythm 
he was placed in the recovery position.  He was placed on 
oxygen and slowly regained consciousness.  After about 15 min 
he started to struggle and efforts had to be made to keep the 
oxygen mask in place.  The boat returned to harbour and an 
ambulance and doctor arrived.  He was taken to hospital where it 
was found that he had inhaled a large quantity of water.  He was 
discharged the following day. 
August 2008 08/376 
Shetland Coastguard was alerted by a dive support vessel 
requesting medical advice for a diver who had coughed up 
blood.  Recommended to go to hospital at Balfour for chest x-ray 
as doesn't seem to be a DCI type incident.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2008 08/238 
A diver was preparing to enter the water from a dive boat when 
he suddenly fell into the water and surfaced the other side of the 
boat.  He was recovered back into the boat and was found to 
have cuts to his head and hands.  First aid treatment was given 
and the boat headed slowly back to harbour.  The diver was in a 
confused state.  The Coastguard was alerted and a helicopter 
and lifeboat were tasked to assist.  The diver was placed on 
oxygen and this eased his confusion.  The diver was taken by 
ambulance and helicopter to hospital where his wounds were 
treated.  It was concluded that line had unravelled from the 
diver's delayed SMB reel, fallen in the water and snagged the 
propeller thus pulling him into the water. 
August 2008 08/256 
A diver conducted a 31 min dive to a maximum depth of 23m 
including a 3 min stop at 6m.  2 hours 6 min later he dived to 
20m.  During this dive he indicated to his buddy that he felt cold.  
The divers surfaced with another pair from the same party.  At 
the surface the cold diver's head was seen to roll and he became 
a little unresponsive.  He was assisted from the water and once 
in the boat he was sick.  He was helped to de-kit, wrapped in a 
blanket and given tea.  30 min later he seemed to be improving 
but was then sick again.  His skin was blue and his attention 
level seemed to be below normal.  The Coastguard was alerted 
and the diver was given more warm clothing and placed on 
oxygen.  Once ashore he was taken into an ambulance and 
further warming was administered.  The diver recovered at the 
scene.  The diver had been diving without a hood. 
August 2008 08/415 
A diver was walking on a wet metal gangplank when he slipped 
and fell.  The cylinder that he was carrying struck him on the 
cheekbone just below his eye.  He sought medical advice and 
severe bruising was diagnosed.  The following day the bruising 
had started to subside and he conducted a 42 min dive to 42m.  
On surfacing from this dive his face was found to be severely 
swollen.  The boat put into the nearest harbour and the diver was 
taken by ambulance to a recompression facility.  Recompression 
was not required and the diver travelled from there to hospital.  
He was diagnosed with subcutaneous emphysema but no 
fractures were found. 
August 2008 08/150 
Two divers descended a shotline.  One of the pair experienced 
difficulties clearing her right ear.  They slowed their descent and 
the diver managed to clear her ear.  They continued downwards 
and the diver had further trouble with her ears.  At a depth of 
12m she experienced a sudden pain in both ears which was so 
severe that she fainted.  Her buddy gave her the 'OK' signal but 
this was not returned.  The diver rolled over and started to sink.  
Her buddy took hold of her and brought her to the surface using 
a controlled buoyant lift.  At the surface he gave an emergency 
signal to the boat and the casualty was quickly recovered.  She 
was still in pain and was placed on oxygen.  The boat returned to 
the shore and the diver was taken to hospital by ambulance.  
The pupil of her right eye was found to be dilated and 
unresponsive and this was thought to be due to bubbles in the 
tear duct.  Her ear drums were swollen but not perforated.  She 
was discharge later that evening. 
August 2008 08/248 
A diver experienced problems with his face mask, it kept filling

with water and he could not clear it.  He struggled to resolve the 
problem and he found it difficult to breathe normally.  His buddy 
saw that he had a problem and assisted him to the surface.  He 
had dived to a maximum depth of 17m for 13 min.  At the surface 
the diver was semiconscious.  He was recovered into the boat 
and the Coastguard was alerted.  The diver was airlifted to a 
recompression chamber but no signs of DCI were found.  It was 
thought that he had inhaled water and he was transferred to 
hospital for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2008 08/247 
Seven divers were riding in an RHIB while it was being towed on 
its trailer along a beach prior to launching.  The RHIB fell from its 
trailer, tipped over and trapped the divers underneath.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and a helicopter, a land ambulance and 
a Coastguard rescue team were tasked to help.  Two women 
suffered leg injuries and were taken by land ambulance and car 
to hospital.  A third woman with suspected spinal injuries was 
airlifted to hospital.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2008 08/171 
A diver experienced a shortness of breath during a dive and 
aborted the dive.  Later that day he was preparing for another 
dive but felt unwell again and decided not to make this dive.  
Later that day he was sitting down when he collapsed.  
Resuscitation techniques were applied and an AED was used.  
He was taken by ambulance to hospital where he died two days 
later.  He is thought to have suffered a heart attack.  (Note: This 
is not recorded as a diving fatality as the individual had been out 
of the water a number of hours before the attack occurred.  It is 
recorded as an illness while diving; the subsequent problems 
were not related to the dive.) 
September 2008 08/388 
Stornoway Coastguard received a call from a dive party 
requesting medical advice for a diver suffering headaches after 
diving to 20m and 17m in a day.  A medical connect call was 
established, the doctor recommended no further action but to 
keep the casualty under observation and contact his own doctor 
if the symptoms continue.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2008 08/264 
A pair of divers conducted a dive in a quarry to a maximum 
depth of 21m.  After 35 min one of the pair was low on air so 
they deployed a delayed SMB and made their ascent.  They had 
a long swim to the exit point and they used the SMB as 
additional buoyancy support.  On the return swim one of the pair 
started to have difficulty breathing and they raised the alarm.  
The diver was recovered by boat and placed on oxygen.  He 
quickly recovered.  His breathing was noisy and he was advised 
to seek medical advice.

October 2007  08/006 
A dive boat with seven people onboard was at anchor in a bay 
while the divers had their lunch between dives.  There was an 
onshore wind and the divers had to reposition the boat when 
the wind shifted.  They recovered the anchor but then found that 
the boat could not be driven even though the engine started and 
ran.  They relaid the anchor and a heavy shotline in an attempt 
to stop the boat being driven ashore.  They made a 'Pan Pan' 
call for assistance.  Three divers swam a line to some adjacent 
rocks and this helped to stabilise the boat's position.  A 
helicopter, an inshore and an all weather lifeboat attended.  The 
inshore lifeboat towed the boat out of the bay and the all 
weather lifeboat towed it back to harbour.  The inshore lifeboat 
picked up the three divers who had swum to the rocks.  It was 
later found that a woodruff key connecting the propeller to its 
shaft had broken. 
October 2007 08/312 
Lifeboat assisted in the search for missing diver(s).  Others 
coped.  (RNLI report). 
October 2007 08/037 
The Coastguard was alerted when a dive boat suffered engine 
failure with one diver in the water.  Another vessel recovered 
the diver and returned him to the disabled boat.  The skipper 
managed to resolve the problem and the boat returned to 
harbour.  This was the second time within the week that this 
vessel had experienced engine failure.  On the first occasion 
the boat had been towed back to harbour and the engine had 
been stripped and checked.  (Coastguard report).

With two pairs of divers in the water the cox of an RHIB 
attempted to restart the engine to return to the shot buoy, 
however the engine would not start.  They tried for 10 to 15 min 
to find the cause meanwhile they drifted further away.  When 
the first pair of divers surfaced the cox contacted the 
Coastguard using a 'Pan Pan' call.  The second pair also 
surfaced and they stayed with the first pair close to the shot 
buoy.  A nearby warship came to their assistance, recovered 
the divers and took the RHIB in tow.  A lifeboat was launched to 
assist.  The divers later determined that the kill switch may have 
become loose or detached.

Report received from shore of two people shouting for help in 
the water.  Two male divers shore diving had got carried away 
by the tide and taken approx 700m offshore where they were 
recovered to shore by a dive boat that was in the area.

Two divers entered the water to make a night dive from a pier, 
their planned duration was no more than 40 min.  Underwater 
visibility was low but they had powerful lamps.  During the dive 
they encountered an unexpected current but thought that it 
would carry them in their intended direction.  After drifting for 5 
min they decided to ascend and during the ascent they became

separated.  Both the divers switched off their torches to try to 
see the other but they were unable to.  They both conducted 
safety stops and surfaced.  At the surface they were sufficiently 
far apart that they could not see each other.  They both realised 
that they were 400m to 500m from their exit point and 300m to 
400m offshore.  Independently they both swam towards the 
shore.  Meanwhile their shore party had become concerned that 
they had not returned and alerted the Coastguard.  A helicopter 
and two lifeboats were tasked to search.  One of the divers 
succeeded in reaching the shore and made his way back to the 
shore party.  He was then able to direct the helicopter to the 
area in which they had surfaced.  The missing diver used his 
torch to attract the attention of the helicopter crew and he was 
quickly recovered. 
May 2008 08/102 
Two boats were engaged in a wreck dive.  The skipper of one of 
the boats alerted the Coastguard when he lost contact with the 
other boat.  The skipper attempted to contact the boat by radio 
and passengers on the boat tried to contact passengers on the 
other boat by mobile phone, but no contact could be made.  The 
missing boat had suffered an engine failure and had made the 
return journey on one engine; which caused them to arrive later 
than expected, after nightfall.  He had turned off his radio to 
save battery power.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2008 08/104 
A group of five divers, a cox and another person returned to a 
marina in an RHIB.  They moored up on a fuel pontoon and one 
person hosed down the boat while the fuel tank was refuelled.  
The tank was overfilled and fuel was spilt; this fuel then ignited.  
The hose was turned on the fire and it was extinguished.  A few 
minutes later the fuel caught fire again.  It was subsequently 
discovered that an exposed wire on the depth sounder was 
intermittently short circuiting and this provided the source of 
ignition.

May 2008 08/110 
An RHIB was following two pairs of divers who were diving to a 
maximum depth of 7m.  With the divers underwater the fuel 
tank in the boat ran out and they switched to the second tank.  
However the engine could not be restarted.  The cox alerted the 
Coastguard and two lifeboats and a helicopter were tasked to 
assist.  The divers surfaced after about 15 min and when they 
realised that the boat was not following them they started to 
swim to the shore.  As they neared the shore a private craft that 
was assisting in the search found them.  The boat and divers 
were safely recovered to the launch point.  It was thought that 
there may have been dirt in the fuel lines.  (Coastguard & RNLI 
reports). 
May 2008 08/337 
Report of a dive boat, a long way offshore, suffering electrical 
failure.  All divers were onboard when it broke down.  A lifeboat 
was tasked to their assistance and towed them back to port.  
(Coastguard report). 
May 2008 08/201 
An RHIB was at anchor with one person aboard while two pairs 
of divers conducted a dive to a depth of around 6m.  The divers 
deployed a delayed SMB to surface, the anchor was lifted and 
the divers were recovered into the boat.  With the divers back in 
the boat attempts were made to start the engine but these were 
unsuccessful.  The anchor was re-deployed and the 
Coastguard was alerted.  A lifeboat was tasked to tow the boat 
to shore.

June 2008 08/118 
Two divers were diving from a small ski boat, leaving one 
person in the boat.  With the divers in the water the cox was 
unable to start the boat's engine and he alerted the Coastguard.  
The divers surfaced and could see the boat but were carried 
away by wind and tide.  A lifeboat was tasked to search and the 
divers were recovered at dusk.  Divers and boat were returned 
safely to the shore.  It is reported that the boat had no flares, no 
radio, no lifejackets and no 'A' flag.  (Coastguard & RNLI 
reports). 
June 2008 08/132 
Two divers entered the water from an RHIB for a planned wall 
dive to a maximum depth of 30m for a duration of 45 min.   
Once underwater they realised that the current was flowing in 
the opposite direction to that expected.  They continued their 
dive and after 25 min one of the pair deployed a delayed SMB 
and they made a normal ascent with a 2 min safety stop at 6m.  
The boat crew did not expect the divers to surface where they 
did and they did not see the divers' SMB.  At the surface the 
divers could see their boat but could not attract the attention of 
those aboard.  The current was moving them away from their 
boat so they used the current to swim to a nearby island.  The 
boat party searched for the missing divers and then alerted the 
Coastguard.  A search was organised involved a helicopter and 
two lifeboats.  Once on the island the divers were able to attract 
the attention of the helicopter.  The helicopter crew alerted their

boat to the divers' position and they were safely recovered.  It 
was subsequently discovered that the divers had misread the 
tide tables. 
June 2008 08/133 
The Coastguard was contacted after a sightseeing boat passed 
over the top of a number of divers, some of whom had SMBs.  
The divers were close to an island and their boat was close to 
them.  The sightseeing boat passed between the dive boat and 
the island.  The divers were in a location that is popular for 
sightseeing and fishing and one that divers have been 
recommended to avoid.  No divers were injured.

A live-aboard dive boat set sail on a 12 hour passage with 
eleven passengers and three crew aboard.  As their passage 
progressed the weather conditions worsened and the boat's 
speed slowed to 3 knots.  The Coastguard was alerted and 
requested hourly position reports.  The crew then discovered 
that a large quantity of water was in the bilges.  Pumps were 
used in an attempt to remove the water but one of them failed to 
function.  Uncertain if they could manage to keep up with the 
influx of water the skipper made a 'Pan Pan' call to the 
Coastguard.  The Coastguard requested that all aboard don 
lifejackets and upgraded the call to 'Mayday'.  A lifeboat and a 
helicopter were tasked to assist and a nearby fisheries 
protection vessel came to help.  The helicopter stood by the 
boat until the lifeboat arrived and then additional pumps were 
passed to the dive boat from the fisheries vessel.  By this time 
the dive boat's remaining pumps had cleared a lot of the water 
and it was escorted into a harbour by the lifeboat.  At the time of 
the incident wave heights were estimated to be in excess of 
10m with occasional peaks of 15m.  The water was found to be 
entering because of a damaged rudder stock; this and the failed 
pump were repaired. 
July 2008 08/351 
Dive support vessel contacted Milford Haven Coastguard 
reporting having picked up two divers, the divers were from 
another vessel. They were returned to the parent vessel.  
(Coastguard report). 
July 2008 08/143 
A group of eight divers conducted a drift dive in a maximum 
depth of 20m.  It was agreed that they would all deploy SMBs 
for the duration of the dive and limit their dive times to 30 min.  
One of the divers failed to deploy his SMB and after the 30 min 
duration had passed and there was no sign of the diver the 
Coastguard was alerted.  A helicopter was tasked to assist and 
the diver was spotted at the surface about 300m from the boat.  
He was safely recovered into the boat.  (Coastguard report). 
 
July 2008 08/355 
Portland Coastguard was alerted by a vessel reporting they had 
recovered two divers from the water, the parent vessel had 
broken down, the recovering vessel returned the divers and the 
parent vessel restarted one engine and returned to harbour.  
(Coastguard report). 
July 2008 08/167 
The Coastguard was alerted when two divers were overdue 
from a dive.  An extensive search was organised involving a 
helicopter, a lifeboat, a warship and other craft.  The divers 
made their way to the shore where they were found by the 
helicopter.  They were safely recovered. 
July 2008 08/360 
Dive support vessel broke down with two divers aboard, the 
vessel was towed to port by a lifeboat from Little Haven.

August 2008 08/181 
Three pairs of divers and one group of four entered the water 
for a drift dive.  All four groups deployed SMBs.  At the end of 
the dive they all surfaced at around the same time.  Two pairs 
and the group of four were recovered into the boat.  When the 
skipper then looked for the final pair they were no longer visible.  
A brief search was conducted but bright sunlight inhibited their 
vision.  Concerned that the remaining divers might be caught in 
a strong current and swept away the skipper contacted the 
Coastguard with a 'Pan Pan' call.  The Coastguard tasked two 
lifeboats and a helicopter to search and another dive boat 
assisted.  The divers were found by this second dive boat over 
a mile from their boat's position.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2008 08/366 
Two divers were adrift for a period of time, Humber Coastguard 
tasked Seahouses ILB and AWLB to search for the missing 
divers, both located no further medical assistance required.  
(Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
August 2008 08/180 
On returning from a dive a pair of divers had agreed to search 
for and recover a mooring chain in an anchorage.  The owner of 
the chain stood by in a dinghy and the divers entered the water 
from another boat.  The divers searched for and found the 
mooring chain and then sent the free end to the surface using a 
delayed SMB.  Once they had completed this they continued 
the dive, slowly making their way towards the shore where they 
left the water.  The plan had however not been clearly 
communicated to the person waiting in the dinghy who 
expected the divers to surface with the chain.  This person then 
spoke with another dive boat skipper and, after a brief search 
involving another boat, they decided to alert the Coastguard 
that the divers were missing.  The Coastguard initiated a search 
involving two lifeboats and a helicopter.  This was watched by 
the two divers from the shore who then realised that it was them 
being searched for.  The Coastguard was informed and the 
search was terminated.

Brixham Coastguard received a call from a diving RHIB 
reporting having broken down with five divers in the water.  
Brixham Coastguard tasked Torbay lifeboat and Coastguard 
rescue helicopter R-106 to assist.  The helicopter found the 
divers and relayed their position to the lifeboat, all were picked 
up safely, the vessel was towed to shore by Torbay AWLB.  
(Coastguard report). 
August 2008 08/183 
The Coastguard was alerted when a dive boat suffered engine 
failure.  A lifeboat and a helicopter were tasked to assist.  They 
stood by until all the divers had surfaced and been recovered 
and then the boat was towed ashore by the lifeboat. 
August 2008 08/232 
Seahouses RNLI lifeboat towed an RHIB, with six persons on 
board, back to Seahouses Harbour after an engine failure at the 
Farne Islands. Seahouses Coastguard Rescue Team assisted 
at the harbour.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2008 08/240 
The cox of an RHIB alerted the Coastguard when a solo drift 
diver was overdue.  A helicopter and two lifeboats were tasked 
to assist.  The diver was quickly found and recovered by a 
passing yacht.  The search was called off and the helicopter 
stood by while the diver was transferred to his RHIB.  It was 
later stated that the SMB line had parted and it was this that 
caused the initial separation.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2008 08/237 
The Coastguard was alerted when a diver was not found at the 
end of his dive.  A search was initiated but another dive boat 
spotted the missing diver at the surface and directed his boat to 
him.  The diver was safely recovered and the search was called 
off.  The diver's SMB had become disconnected from the line 
and when he surfaced he was 100m from his boat and the sea 
state prevented him from being seen.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2008 08/239 
An RHIB was covering two divers close to some rocks.  It was 
struck by three large waves and carried onto the rocks.  The 
cox made a 'Mayday' call but, due to the noise of the boat on 
the rocks, heard no reply.  The RHIB was turned on its side but 
the cox and another person in the boat were able to right it.  
The cox managed to re-start the engine and pull the boat off the 
rocks.  A lifeboat was tasked to assist but another dive boat 
went to the aid of the troubled RHIB, recovered their divers and 
escorted them back to harbour.  There was minor damage to 
the boat and the cox and crew sustained cuts, bruises and neck 
and back whiplash injuries. 
August 2008 08/246 
The Coastguard was alerted when two divers failed to surface 
at the planned time after a wreck dive.  A helicopter and a 
lifeboat were tasked to search, then another boat in the area 
reported seeing an SMB.  The dive boat investigated and found 
that the divers were safe and well and the search was called off.  
The dive plan was for the divers to deploy a delayed SMB prior 
to making their ascent.  The missing divers did not do this and 
they ran into unplanned decompression stops.  There was a 3 
kt current running and the divers only deployed their delayed 
SMB when they were 1 min from surfacing.  They were thus 
some way from their boat when their SMB appeared at the 
surface.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2008 08/262 
Two divers were conducting a drift dive in a maximum depth of 
20m.  One of the divers had a regulator free flow and surfaced, 
however his buddy did not.  The buddy's SMB line then became 
tangled with a lobster pot line and the diver cut it, this resulted 
in the SMB floating free.  The boat approached the SMB but no 
bubbles could be seen.  The SMB was recovered and it was 
then discovered that the diver was missing.  The Coastguard 
was alerted and a search was initiated involving a helicopter, 
two lifeboats and other craft.  The missing diver was found 
about 20 min after the call to the Coastguard was made.  He 
was safely recovered into his boat.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2008 08/263 
The Coastguard was alerted when a solo diver was not seen to 
surface after a 60 min dive to 14m.  A helicopter was tasked to 
search but the search was terminated when the missing diver 
was found on the shore.  There is a suggestion that the diver's 
SMB may have been pulled below the surface thus causing the 
loss of contact with the boat.  The diver was at the surface for 
20 min before the Coastguard was alerted and he decided to 
make his own way to the shore.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2008 08/270 
A lone diver was picked up and reported that his buddy had 
been missing for about an hour.  The Coastguard was alerted 
and a search was initiated involving two lifeboats.  A short time 
later the missing diver was located safe and well on the shore 
and the search was terminated.  (Media report). 
September 2008 08/414 
The Coastguard was alerted when two divers were thought to 
be missing.  A search was initiated involving a helicopter, three 
lifeboats and a shore team, but no sign of the divers was found.  
This is thought to have been a false alarm.  (Coastguard 
report). 
September 2008 08/272 
Two divers conducted a 44 min dive to a maximum depth of 
20m.  One of the two divers had only one leg and part of one of 
his hands was missing.  When they surfaced they found that a 
heavy fog had formed and they could not see their boat.  They 
climbed onto some nearby rocks.  The less able diver was 
using a twin-set and he found it impossible to get back in the 
water to swim to the boat.  Another diver from the boat entered 
the water, swam to them, assisted the diver into the water and 
helped him back to the boat.

The Coastguard was alerted when two divers surfaced from 
24m missing decompression stops.  They had become tangled 
in their surface marker buoy and were pulled to the surface.  
(Coastguard report). 
October 2007 08/007 
Two divers entered the water to dive on a wreck.  One of the 
pair thought that the mouthpiece of his regulator was loose and 
he took some time at the surface checking.  They then 
descended a shotline.  They reached the seabed at a depth of 
41m.  The shotline was too long and they turned on their 
torches and followed the line along the seabed.  The diver who 
had concerns about his mouthpiece then swam to his buddy 
and signalled that he wanted to ascend.  His buddy noticed that 
he was in some distress and tried to calm him.  They held on to 
each other and the buddy inflated both BCDs.  They made a 
rapid ascent to the surface in 1 min.  Their dive duration was 7 
min.  They were recovered into the boat and the distressed 
diver was placed on nitrox 80 and then oxygen.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and a helicopter was tasked to assist. 
October 2007 08/027 
Two divers made a 35 min dive to a maximum depth of 8m.  
After a surface interval of 2 hours 37 min they dived to a 
maximum depth of 21m.  During the ascent from this dive they 
lost buoyancy control and sank back down to 15m.  They then 
made a rapid ascent to 5m where they made a 2 min safety 
stop.  One of the divers was running very low on air and he 
ascended to the surface and ditched his weights.  They sought 
assistance and were placed on oxygen.  One of the pair 
complained of 'tired legs' and this was put down to their long 
surface swim.  Both were placed on oxygen and no further 
actions were reported. 
October 2007 08/016 
A trainee diver undertook his second dive of the day.  On the 
first dive he had been too heavy and during the second dive it 
was planned that he would shed some of the weight to get his 
buoyancy correct.  The diver, an instructor and another trainee 
descended to a maximum depth of 10m.  During the descent 
the trainee diver removed two 1 kg weights.  They made their 
return following an upward sloping bottom.  During this return 
swim air migrated in the trainee's drysuit and he became 
inverted.  He ascended to 6m before he was able to recover 
and swim back down.  As he swam back down to 8m he started 
to become buoyant again and he was carried to the surface.  
He exhaled all the way and the instructor and the other trainee 
held on to his fins to slow his ascent.  At the surface he inflated 
his BCD and was breathing rapidly due to panic.  Once ashore 
he was placed on oxygen.  The diver suffers from asthma and, 
although he did not suffer an attack, he used his inhaler as a 
precaution.  An ambulance was on scene due to a previous, 
unrelated, incident and it was decided to take him to hospital for 
a check up.  He was released later that day. 
October 2007 08/417 
A diver on a training course descended to a depth of 2m.  She 
operated her drysuit inflator valve and it stuck open.  She made 
a rapid ascent to the surface where the suit continued to inflate.  
The hose was disconnected and she was assisted to the shore.  
She was placed on oxygen and treated for shock.  She was 
taken by ambulance to hospital and discharged later that day.  
Grit had been found in the hose connector earlier that day. 
November 2007 08/032 
A trainee and an instructor conducted a dive to a maximum 
depth of 15m for a planned duration of 30 min.  After 20 min the 
trainee lost control of his buoyancy at a depth of 5m and rose to 
the surface.  At the surface he did not respond to signals from 
the boat and was seen to be in a face down position.  The boat 
approached and the instructor surfaced close by.  The trainee 
was recovered into the boat.  He did not suffer any ill effects 
and had been face down looking for his buddy. 
November 2007 08/038 
A trainee and an instructor entered the water for the trainee's 
first dive in a drysuit.  He had a 3 kg shot pack in each of the 
integrated weight pouches of his BCD and a 2 kg shot pack in 
both the pockets of his BCD.  They completed a successful dive 
to a maximum depth of 17m for 40 min.  After a surface interval 
of 1 hour 46 min they made a second dive.  During the surface 
interval the trainee had moved the 2 kg packs from the BCD 
pockets to the integrated weight pouches of the BCD.  During 
the second dive it was planned that the trainee would practise 
use of an SMB.  They dived to a maximum depth of 18m and 
towards the end of the dive, at a depth of 12m, the weights fell 
from one of the trainee's weight pouches and he started a 
buoyant ascent.  He managed to halt the ascent at about 9m 
and swam back down.  The instructor found and refitted the 
weights.  The trainee had become tangled in the SMB line and 
the instructor freed him.  They continued up a slope to make 
their exit but, at a depth of about 9m, the weights detached 
once again and the diver was carried rapidly to the surface.  
The instructor went with him and they left the water.  The 
instructor later recovered the dropped weight.  Subsequent 
examination of the weight system suggested that the clips 
retaining the weights may not have been fastened correctly. 
November 2007 08/031 
A diver dived with three buddies to a maximum depth of 35m.  
When he deployed a delayed SMB the line became tangled and 
he was caught in it.  He made a fast ascent to the surface 
missing a 5 min decompression stop.  The other divers 
surfaced normally.  Specialist advice was sought.  The diver 
developed no symptoms and no further action was reported. 
November 2007 08/022 
Two divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 
34m.  When one of them reached 100 bar they headed back to 
the shotline.  However, they were unable to find it and so they 
deployed a delayed SMB to make their ascent.  During 
deployment the SMB line got caught so the diver let go of the 
reel and SMB.  The divers had dropped back down about 3m 
while they tried to resolve the problem.  They ascended slowly 
to 6m where they conducted a stop of about 9 min.  One of the 
divers indicated that he had 1 min of decompression stop left 
but the signal was mis-understood by the other diver and as a 
result they both surfaced.  Once in the boat they were placed on 
oxygen for about 25 min.  No symptoms developed and no 
further action was taken. 
November 2007 08/043 
Two divers descended a shotline to a wreck.  When they 
reached the wreck one of the pair dropped down the outside of 
the hull; at this point the light level was low and the diver felt 
uneasy.  His buddy went with him and the uneasy diver grabbed 
hold of him.  They reached the bottom at a depth of 37m. The 
uneasy diver signalled that he wanted to ascend.   The buddy

deployed a delayed SMB and tried to make an ascent.  
However, the uneasy diver was heavy and the buddy struggled 
to get them back up to 34m.  Because of the hold that the other 
diver had on him the rescuing diver was not able to conduct a 
controlled lift in the normal way so he put some air into his own 
BCD.  They started their ascent and the rescuing diver 
attempted to control their speed by releasing air from both his 
and the other diver's suits and BCDs.  They ascended from 
30m to the surface in less than 1 min.  At the surface the 
rescuing diver gave the emergency signal and they were 
recovered into their boat.  The emergency services were alerted 
and the divers were placed on oxygen.  They were taken by 
lifeboat to the shore and then transferred to hospital.  They 
were placed on oxygen for 4 hours and then discharged.  It is 
thought that the troubled diver had been affected by nitrogen 
narcosis. 
December 2007 08/024 
A diver was diving with a new weightbelt and trying to reduce 
the amount of weight that he was carrying.  He dived with a 
buddy to a maximum depth of 21m.  As they ascended at the 
end of the dive he attempted to deploy a delayed SMB mid-
water but he was too buoyant and struggled to stay at depth.  
His buddy stopped him and deployed his own delayed SMB.  
They ascended to 6m normally but, at this point, the buoyant 
diver was unable to prevent himself from making an 
uncontrolled ascent to the surface.  He then finned back down 
to his buddy and held onto a structure on the bottom.  His 
buddy put rocks into his BCD pockets and they made a 3 min 
stop and then surfaced.  On surfacing the buoyant diver 
complained of chest pain.  He attended hospital and was kept in 
overnight for observation. 
January 2008 08/045 
Two divers commenced a dive in a lake.  They followed a rope 
down to a depth of 30m.  Other divers had previously swum this 
route and the visibility was very poor.  At 30m they signalled by 
touch that they should ascend.  They rose to 21m and one of 
the pair attempted to deploy a delayed SMB.  The cold made it 
difficult for the diver to attach the buoy to the line.  When the 
buoy was deployed the line came off the spool and became 
tangled in the mechanism.  During this time the divers sank 
back down to 32m.  The diver with the SMB felt panicked and 
he used a lot of air.  They made a rapid ascent to about 5m and 
then made a 5 min stop at depths between 6m and 3m.  During 
this time the troubled diver noticed that he only had 20 bar 
remaining and he switched to his pony regulator.  The other 
diver mis-understood signals from the troubled diver and 
assumed that the troubled diver's computer had malfunctioned 
so they completed their stops using the other diver's computer.  
The other diver was using nitrox 32 and when they eventually 
surfaced the troubled diver was found to have missed some 
decompression.  At the surface the troubled diver became 
entangled in his SMB line.  Once out of the water he breathed 
nitrox 32 at intervals during the next 2 hours.  No symptoms 
developed and no further action was taken.  The reel was new 
and when the diver had tied a clip to the end of the line he had 
omitted to pass the line through a line guide on the reel, thus 
allowing it to slip and tangle. 
February 2008 08/303 
Three divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 35m.  
They then ascended to 20m to continue the dive.  One of the 
pair was low on air and ascended to 6m and then surfaced 
having completed decompression stops.  The other two divers 
ascended to 6m and while doing so the drysuit dump valve of 
one of the pair became blocked and the diver rose to the 
surface.  This diver immediately re-descended but the two lost 
contact with each other.  They both independently completed 
their decompression stops and surfaced safely.  It is thought 
that the blocked dump valve was caused by the diver's 
undersuit.  No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
February 2008 08/319 
Solent Coastguard was alerted to two divers having missed 
stops from 28m, a connect call for medical advice was 
established, the divers were monitored aboard the dive support 
vessel, no further action.  (Coastguard report). 
February 2008 08/048 
Three divers completed a 26 min dive to a maximum depth of 
18m.  1 hour 20 min later they dived again.  They were at a 
maximum depth of 18m when one of them lost his regulator; he 
started to panic and made a rapid ascent to the surface.  The 
bubbles confused another of the group who also made a faster 
than normal ascent to the surface.  Their dive duration was 9 
min.  Once out of the water, both of these divers were placed on 
oxygen.  The third diver was unaffected.  No subsequent ill 
effects were reported. 
February 2008 08/051 
Two divers were diving at a depth of 21m when one of them 
experienced a regulator free flow.  The divers made a rapid 
ascent to the surface.  They were recovered by boat and placed 
on oxygen.  No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
February 2008 08/050 
Two divers conducted a 33 min dive to a maximum depth of 
17m with a safety stop at 6m.  2 hours 15 min later they dived 
again.  As they descended on the second dive water entered 
the drysuit of one of the divers and they decided to abort the 
dive.  They both deployed delayed SMBs.  One of them used 
his octopus regulator to do this and the regulator went into free 
flow.  The other diver offered his octopus regulator but the diver 
could not get air from it despite the fact that it had been found to 
function correctly during their buddy checks.  The diver with the 
free flow then made a rapid ascent to the surface; his buddy 
went with him.  At the surface they called for assistance and 
were helped from the water.  Both were monitored for 
symptoms; none were experienced and no further action was 
reported. 
February 2008 08/106 
Three divers conducted a wreck dive.  15 min into the dive, at a 
depth of 9m, one of the divers became inverted with air in the 
boots of his drysuit.  His buddies were able to right him but he 
made a buoyant ascent to the surface missing a planned safety 
stop at 6m.  He suffered no subsequent ill effects.  It was later 
determined that the drysuit did not fit him correctly. 
March 2008 08/053 
Two divers entered the water to conduct a night dive.  About 3 
min into the dive, at a depth of 20m, the regulator of one of the 
pair went into free flow.  They made a fast ascent to the 
surface.  Once out of the water they were placed on oxygen.  
No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
March 2008 08/276 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 21m.  At 
20m one of the pair had a regulator free flow.  He was unable to 
get a normal breath and panicked.  He ditched his weightbelt 
and made a rapid ascent to the surface.  His dive duration was 
5 min.  No subsequent ill effects were experienced.

March 2008 08/275 
Two divers dived to a maximum depth of 29m.  At 21m one of 
the pair suffered a regulator free flow.  They made an ascent 
using the buddy's alternative air source.  Their ascent was 
rapid, taking only 1 min from 21m.  Both divers were placed on 
oxygen but no subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
March 2008 08/277 
Two divers were following a sloping contour downwards.  At 
30m one of the pair lost control of his drysuit buoyancy and 
made a rapid, inverted ascent.  No subsequent ill effects were 
reported. 
April 2008 08/322 
Brixham Coastguard was alerted by a dive support vessel to a 
diver having made a rapid ascent, Plymouth lifeboat was tasked 
to bring the diver ashore where it was met by an ambulance for 
transportation to DDRC Plymouth.  (Coastguard & RNLI 
reports). 
April 2008 08/278 
Two divers were following a sloping contour downwards.  At a 
depth of 24m one of the pair lost control of her drysuit 
buoyancy.  Her foot came out of the drysuit boot and she made 
a rapid, inverted ascent to the surface, taking 40 seconds to 
ascend from 24m.  She was placed on oxygen.  No subsequent 
ill effects were experienced. 
April 2008 08/066 
Two divers conducted a drift dive in a maximum depth of 14m.  
Underwater they linked themselves together with a buddy line to 
avoid separation.  The diver with the SMB experienced 
problems with his weightbelt and when they came across a 
ledge he used this as shelter from the current to resolve the 
problem.  He passed the SMB to his buddy and lay on the 
bottom to adjust the belt.  The buddy was unsure of what was 
happening and thought that the diver was in trouble.  He moved 
to assist and released the diver's weightbelt.  This caused the 
pair to make a buoyant ascent to the surface.  Their dive 
duration was 21 min.  The divers were recovered into their boat.  
The buddy was sick and reported double vision.  He then felt 
'pins and needles' in his toes and the Coastguard was alerted.  
Both divers were placed on oxygen and once ashore they were 
taken to hospital.  The divers quickly recovered and no further 
action was taken.  The buddy had previously been suffering 
from seasickness and neither diver had eaten their lunch.  The 
divers had both dived to 20m 1 hour 49 min before the subject 
dive, the diver with the loose belt for 24 min and his buddy for 
39 min. 
April 2008 08/279 
Four trainees planned to dive to a depth of 22m in a quarry.  
However the group descended to a maximum depth of 32m at 
which point two of the divers' regulators began to free flow.  
One of the divers with a free flow made a rapid ascent to the 
surface with another of the group.  At the surface they called for 
help and a boat was sent to recover them.  They were placed 
on oxygen and one of the pair stated that the two other divers 
were still underwater.  The boat went out to where a stream of 
bubbles could be seen but were then directed by the group's 
instructor, who was on the shore, to two divers leaving the 
water.  The boat went to investigate, found that these were not 
the missing divers and returned to the spot where the bubbles 
were seen.  2 min later the missing divers surfaced.  The one 
with the free flow was out of air and her BCD was inflated orally.  
They swam to the shore and left the water.  The diver with the 
free flow in the first pair complained of a pain in her chest but 
this was thought to be a strain.  Later she complained of a 
severe headache.  Diving medical advice was sought and she 
was advised to attend her local hospital A&E department. 
April 2008 08/306 
A pair of divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 
21m.  On reaching the wreck one of the pair signalled that her 
mask was flooded.  She cleared her mask but about 3 min later 
it flooded again.  She cleared it but again, after another few 
minutes it flooded once more.  Once again she cleared the 
mask and then signalled that she wanted to ascend.  The other 
diver deployed a delayed SMB which took him some time 
because he had difficulty inflating it.  During this time the diver 
again signalled that she wanted to ascend and became 
distressed.  The other diver tried to calm her but just as the 
SMB was nearing the surface the troubled diver again gave the 
ascend signal and then started to fin upwards.  The other diver 
abandoned the SMB, took hold of the troubled diver and 
attempted to slow their ascent.  At 6m he released his grip, 
conducted a safety stop and then surfaced.  The troubled diver 
rose directly to the surface and was recovered into the boat.  
Her dive duration was 11 min.  She was placed on oxygen but, 
apart from a headache, no symptoms developed and no further 
action was taken.  Subsequently the troubled diver reported that 
her regulator felt as if it was delivering water as well as air and 
grit was found to be preventing the exhaust valve from sealing 
fully.  She was also concerned about controlling her drysuit 
buoyancy. 
April 2008 08/326 
Clyde Coastguard was alerted to two divers who had missed 
decompression stops following a dive to 30m.  The divers had 
surfaced and seeing a ferry coming closer had re-descended to 
avoid being run down, as a result they were way over their time.  
Largs's lifeboat and Cumbrae Coastguard attended.  
(Coastguard report). 
May 2008 08/088 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 33m.  During 
the ascent his cuff dump failed to operate and he made a rapid 
ascent missing an indicated 6 min of stops.  His dive duration 
was 27 min.  He was taken to a recompression facility and 
placed on oxygen for 3 hours. 
May 2008 08/282 
Three divers conducted a 37 min dive to a depth of 35m.  Later 
that day they dived to a planned depth of 36m.  One of the three 
was using a rebreather and as they descended, at a depth of 
21m the rebreather flooded.  They aborted the dive and made a 
faster than normal ascent to the surface.  Their dive duration 
was 10 min.  No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
May 2008 08/199 
A diver experienced difficulties with a weightbelt clip at a depth 
of 10m.  As he tried to refasten it he rose 2m and became 
inverted.  He attempted to right himself by holding on to some 
kelp but his hand slipped and he made an inverted buoyant 
ascent to the surface.  He was placed on oxygen but no 
symptoms developed and no further action was taken. 
May 2008 08/335 
Diver made a rapid ascent.   Individual believed was under-
weighted for dive, so added more weight.  Then felt he was 
sinking so added too much air to his BCD and drysuit causing a 
rapid ascent and panic.  (Coastguard report).

May 2008 08/198 
Three divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 25m.  At 
a depth of 18m one of the three developed buoyancy control 
problems and began to rise upwards and one of his buddies 
went with him and attempted to dump air from his drysuit.  They 
ascended slowly to 10m where they stopped for a minute.  The 
third diver watched from a depth of about 17m.  The buoyant 
diver then began to rise again and his buddy broke contact with 
him at 7m.  The buoyant diver rose rapidly to the surface.  His 
dive duration was 22 min.  The buddy made her ascent and the 
third diver deployed a delayed SMB and made a normal ascent.  
The buoyant diver and his buddy were placed on oxygen and 
given fluids.  No symptoms developed and no further action was 
taken. 
May 2008 08/099 
Three divers were ascending from a dive.  One of the three was 
underweighted and they made a faster than normal ascent. 
May 2008 08/285 
A trainee and an instructor conducted a dive to a maximum 
depth of 21m.  At this depth the trainee's regulator started to 
free flow.  He switched to his alternative air source but this free 
flowed too.  He made a faster than normal ascent to the 
surface.  Once out of the water he was placed on oxygen.  No 
subsequent ill effects were reported. 
May 2008 08/200 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 27m.  The 
regulator of one of the divers suddenly failed and would no 
longer deliver air.  The diver's contents gauge showed 130 bar 
remaining in the cylinder.  He gave the 'out of air' signal to his 
buddy who gave him his main regulator and then switched to 
his octopus regulator.  During this process the divers lost 
control of their buoyancy and were unable to prevent a rapid 
ascent to the surface.  Once out of the water the divers were 
placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  The 
Coastguard arranged for diving medical advice and the divers 
were told to attend a recompression facility once ashore.  This 
they did and no signs of DCI were found.  Shortly after surfacing 
the regulator was still malfunctioning but when checked ashore 
it was found to work correctly.  The demand valve was returned 
to the manufacturer but at the time of reporting no fault had 
been found. 
May 2008 08/286 
A pair of divers conducted a 34 min dive to a maximum depth of 
19m.  1 hour 30 min later they dived to 20m.  During this dive, 
at a depth of 18m, one of the divers became confused and 
thought that she had become separated from her buddy.  She 
started to ascend but felt that she wasn't going up so she 
dropped one of her weights.  Her buddy, who was in fact close 
to her, saw what was happening and slowed her ascent.  They 
ascended from 14m to the surface in 1 min.  Their dive duration 
was 13 min.  The divers were placed on oxygen.  No 
subsequent ill effects were reported. 
June 2008 08/339 
A medilink call was provided between a diver and a diving 
doctor after the diver missed 3 min of stops following a dive to 
24m for 23 min, although he displayed no signs or symptoms of 
DCI.  The doctor advised no medical attention was required and 
to go home, but not drive himself, and have someone stay with 
him and monitor him for symptoms.  The doctor intended to 
speak to the diver later in the day to confirm that he was alright.  
(Coastguard report). 
June 2008 08/342 
A medical link call was made to a dive doctor for medical advice 
for a diver who had surfaced and missed 20 min of stops.  The 
boat was advised to place the diver on 100% oxygen and then 
contact them when they returned to shore.  The diver later 
made contact with the hospital who gave further advice over the 
telephone.  The vessel had to call by telephone for assistance 
as their radio was not working!  (Coastguard report). 
June 2008 08/202 
A diver descended a shotline to a wreck in a maximum depth of 
25m.  On the wreck he noticed that he was tilting to one side 
and he discovered that he had lost the weight from one of his 
weight pockets.  He indicated the problem to his buddy but felt 
that he could continue the dive.  After a dive duration of 19 min 
and at a depth of 20m he asked his buddy to deploy his delayed 
SMB to make their ascent.  At this point he lost control of his 
buoyancy and made a rapid ascent to the surface.  He 
remembers checking the security of the weight fastening during 
the buddy checks and believes that jostling with other divers on 
the shotline during the descent may have caused it to fall away.  
No subsequent ill effects were reported.

A diver missed 4 min of stops following a normal ascent.  
Although he was not displaying any signs or symptoms of DCI 
his computer had locked out.  As a precaution the boat was 
connected to a dive doctor for medical advice.  The advice was 
to remain on 100% oxygen and monitor for the onset of 
symptoms.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2008 08/308 
A pair of divers conducted a drift dive to a maximum depth of 
18m.  One of the pair had his weights split with 8 kg integrated 
into his BCD and an 8 kg weightbelt.  During the dive his 
weightbelt came undone and fell clear.  The diver started a 
buoyant ascent and his buddy, who was attached by a buddy 
line, went with him.  They tried to slow the ascent but rose, 
faster than normal, to the surface.  Once back in the boat both 
were placed on oxygen and given fluids.  When the oxygen ran 
out they breathed nitrox 35.  The Coastguard was alerted and 
diving medical advice was sought.  The group was advised to 
monitor the pair for signs of symptoms; none developed and no 
further action was taken. 
June 2008 08/208 
An instructor and two trainees conducted a wreck dive to a 
maximum depth of 13m.  There was a current and they 
sheltered in the lee of the wreck to practise using an SMB reel.  
One of the trainees, who was using a drysuit for the first time in 
open water, was seen to be a little light.  They moved to the top 
of the wreck and the current picked up.  At this point the diver 
who had been slightly buoyant lost control of her buoyancy and 
rose rapidly to the surface.  The instructor and the other trainee 
followed at a slower pace.  All were safely recovered into the 
boat and the diver who had made the buoyant ascent was 
placed on oxygen.  She developed no symptoms and no further 
action was taken. 
June 2008 08/209 
Two divers descended a shotline to a wreck in a maximum 
depth of 30m.  However the shotline was slack and they 
reached the seabed some distance from the wreck.  One of the 
pair had ear problems so they rose to 15m and then re-
descended.  They failed to find the wreck and the diver who had 
had ear problems deployed a delayed SMB to ascend.  In the 
process he lost control of his buoyancy and made a rapid 
ascent to the surface.  His buddy followed at a normal rate.

They were recovered into the boat, the diver who had made the 
rapid ascent was placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was 
alerted.  Once ashore the diver was taken by ambulance to 
hospital, he was kept on oxygen then discharged later that day. 
July 2008 08/210 
A pair of divers prepared to conduct a wreck dive.  During the 
buddy checks one of the pair noticed that his buddy's suit 
inflation hose was not attached and he had to straighten her 
cylinder and release the hose to enable it to be attached.  This 
delayed them and they allowed other divers to go ahead of 
them.  The diver whose hose had been disconnected was seen 
to be agitated and shaking and, once in the water, she became 
entangled in the shotline and had to be assisted free.  When 
underwater she became separated from her buddy on two 
occasions and he had to re-locate her.  They dived to a 
maximum depth of 33m and then moved back to the top of the 
wreck after about 33 min.  The diver who had had the problems 
held the reel and handed her delayed SMB to her buddy who 
filled it for her with his octopus regulator; she then started to 
rise quickly.  The buddy went with her and, at 14m, saw that the 
ratchet of the reel had not been released.  He released it at 
12m allowing the SMB to go to the surface.  He then started to 
sink back, now holding the reel.  He stabilised his buoyancy at 
14m and made a normal ascent including 4 min of 
decompression stops.  The troubled diver was carried directly to 
the surface, arriving feet first.  This diver was recovered from 
the water and placed on oxygen.  Once ashore both divers were 
taken by ambulance to a recompression facility.  The diver who 
had made the rapid ascent was given precautionary 
recompression treatment.  Her computer was subsequently 
found not to have been working. 
July 2008 08/349 
Humber Coastguard received a call from a vessel requesting 
evacuation of a diver who had made a rapid ascent from 33m, 
R-128 flew the casualty to Hull hyperbaric chamber.  
(Coastguard report). 
July 2008 08/348 
Diver made a rapid ascent from 13m, was placed on oxygen by 
support vessel.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2008 08/350 
Shetland Coastguard received a call from a diving support 
vessel requesting assistance for a diver who had missed stops 
following a dive.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2008 08/253 
Two divers dived to a maximum depth of 30m; one was using 
air, the other nitrox 32.  After 30 min one of the pair deployed a 
delayed SMB but the reel jammed and the diver let it go.  When 
they reached 6m the air diver had 13 min of decompression 
stops and the nitrox diver had none.  After 3 min of stops the 
nitrox diver was low on gas and switched to her pony cylinder.  
When she switched her main regulator began to free flow and 
while trying to sort this out she lost control of her buoyancy and 
ascended to the surface.  The air diver still had 10 min of 
decompression remaining but she was concerned about her 
buddy and she too ascended to the surface.  Advice was sought 
from a recompression facility and the air diver was placed on 
oxygen.  Checks were made against decompression dive tables 
and it was concluded that the diver was not at risk.  No 
symptoms developed and no further action was taken.  The air 
diver's computer was later found to be significantly more 
conservative than another diver's computer when checked on a 
subsequent dive. 
July 2008 08/352 
Brixham Coastguard received a call from a dive support vessel 
who had returned to port with a diver who had made a rapid 
ascent from 24m, the diver was placed under observation, no 
further medical assistance required.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2008 08/212 
A pair of divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 32m.  
When they started their ascent their dive computers showed 15 
min and 20 min decompression respectively.  They ascended 
slowly and when they reached 6m both computers indicated 20 
min decompression.  One of the divers was under-weighted and 
struggled to stay down.  In doing so she used her air more 
rapidly and she ran out with 6 min of decompression still 
required.  Her buddy gave her his octopus regulator but she got 
her fin tangled in the SMB line and they both rose to the 
surface.  Their dive duration was 61 min.  The diver who ran out 
of air surfaced with a headache.  She had been seasick before 
the dive and felt sick again once back in the boat.  She was 
placed on oxygen.  The divers had not agreed a dive time or 
planned their decompression prior to the dive. 
July 2008 08/290 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 20m.  
Towards the end of their dive, at a depth of 20m, they lost 
control of their buoyancy and they both made a rapid ascent to 
the surface.   Once out of the water they were placed on 
oxygen.  One of the pair developed apparent signs of DCI and 
diving medical advice was sought.  Recompression was 
recommended and the divers were airlifted to a recompression 
facility.  Once there treatment was not found necessary and 
they were discharged. 
July 2008 08/292 
A trainee and an instructor dived to a maximum depth of 25m.  
Towards the end of the dive they were at a depth of about 1m 
when the trainee ran out of air.  The instructor gave him his 
alternative air source but the trainee swallowed some water, 
panicked and rushed for the surface.  His dive duration was 27 
min.  No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
July 2008 08/364 
Solent Coastguard was alerted by a dive support vessel 
indicating they had a diver having made a rapid ascent from 
55m, the casualty was airlifted by rescue helicopter 104 to 
hospital for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2008 08/225 
Two divers completed a 51 min dive to a maximum depth of 
31m with a 3 min stop at 6m and a 20 min stop at 10m.  3 hours 
later they dived to a maximum depth of 30m.  During their 
ascent, at a depth of 8m, they stopped and one of the divers 
deployed a delayed SMB.  He used an auxiliary regulator to 
inflate the buoy.  During inflation the regulator became tangled 
in the buoy line.  The SMB dragged the diver to the surface.  He 
was able to slow his ascent by finning and his computer did not 
register a rapid ascent.  His dive duration was 34 min.  The 
other diver deployed his SMB and made a normal ascent 
including a 3 min safety stop.  The second diver was unaware 
of what had happened to his buddy.  Diving medical advice was 
sought for the diver who had been dragged to the surface and 
he was monitored for 48 hours.  No symptoms were 
experienced and no further action was required. 
August 2008 08/365 
Holyhead Coastguard received a call reporting two divers 
making a rapid ascent from Dorothea quarry following a dive to

19m.  Both casualties monitored but no further medical action 
taken.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2008 08/368 
Clyde Coastguard received a call requesting assistance for a 
diver having made a rapid ascent from 25m.  The diver was 
transported to shore and treated at Millport chamber.  
(Coastguard report). 
August 2008 08/294 
An instructor and two trainees dived to a maximum depth of 
10m.  One of the trainees made a rapid ascent to the surface 
and was seen by other divers coughing, breathless and 
apparently in distress.  She was recovered into a boat and 
placed on oxygen.  She quickly recovered but later complained 
of a 'crackling' in her chest.  The emergency services were 
alerted and she was taken by ambulance to hospital from where 
she was later discharged. 
August 2008 08/184 
A rebreather diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 
30m.  During his ascent he deployed a delayed SMB at a depth 
of 20m.  At this point he experienced difficulty breathing and he 
switched to open circuit.  This did not resolve the problem so he 
decided to make a rapid ascent to the surface.  His dive 
duration was 27 min.  The Coastguard was alerted and the 
diver was airlifted to a recompression facility for treatment.  
(Coastguard report). 
August 2008 08/231 
Two divers entered the water to conduct a drift dive alongside a 
wall.  They descended to a depth of 14m but visibility was poor 
and one of the divers seemed apprehensive so they decided to 
abort the dive and make their ascent.  During the ascent the 
apprehensive diver lost the regulator from her mouth, panicked 
and started to rush for the surface.  Her buddy caught her, gave 
her his pony regulator and dumped air from her BCD to control 
the ascent.  They sank back down to 19m although they did not 
realise this until they hit the bottom.  The buddy then lifted the 
troubled diver to the surface.  Their total dive time was 9 min.  
Once back in the boat they both breathed oxygen for 5 min.  
The Coastguard was alerted and diving medical advice was 
sought.  The divers were monitored and refrained from diving 
for 24 hours.  No symptoms developed and no further action 
was taken. 
August 2008 08/230 
Two divers conducted a drift dive to a maximum depth of 20m.  
One of the pair had felt under-weighted on her previous dive 
and added 2 kg to her weights.  On the descent this diver 
noticed that her BCD direct feed control stuck slightly but 
appeared to resolve itself.  After about 14 min the divers were in 
very poor visibility and they agreed to make their ascent.  The 
buddy of the diver with the BCD problem deployed his delayed 
SMB and they started to ascend.  In low visibility the diver with 
the SMB struggled to keep the other diver in view.  The other 
diver then had problems with her BCD control again and she 
lost control of her buoyancy.  She disconnected the hose and 
dumped air from her BCD and suit but she was unable to 
prevent herself making a rapid ascent to the surface.  The diver 
with the SMB looked around for her but could not see her; he 
then ascended as quickly as safely possible.  Both divers were 
recovered into the boat and the diver who had made the 
buoyant ascent was placed on oxygen.  She was symptom-free 
but the Coastguard was notified once the party was back on the 
shore.  Diving medical advice was sought and she was given 
fluids and monitored for 24 hours.  No symptoms developed 
and no further action was taken. 
August 2008 08/381 
Brixham Coastguard received a call from dive support vessel 
reporting a diver had missed stops and was requesting medical 
connect call.  DDRC doctor was connected with the vessel and 
advised to seek medical assistance with own doctor as a 
precaution.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2008 08/382 
Falmouth Coastguard was contacted by dive support vessel 
reporting having a diver aboard who had missed stops and was 
requesting  a medical connect call with DDRC Plymouth.  
(Coastguard report). 
September 2008 08/251 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 25m.  One 
diver had twin 12l cylinders, the other had a single 12l cylinder.  
Towards the end of the dive the diver with the single cylinder 
indicated that he had 80 bar remaining.  The other diver 
deployed a delayed SMB to make their ascent.  Their 
computers indicated that 10 min of decompression stops were 
required.  The diver with the single cylinder had difficulty 
ascending and when they reached 6m they kept drifting apart.  
It was then found that the diver with the single cylinder had only 
10 bar left in his cylinder and he began to panic.  His buddy 
gave him his octopus regulator but in doing so they drifted up to 
3m.  They re-descended to 6m but the SMB line became 
tangled around the buddy's foot.  Again they drifted back up to 
3m and then surfaced missing 7 min of decompression stops.  
They were recovered into the boat and placed on oxygen.  No 
symptoms developed and no further action was taken. 
September 2008 08/386 
Portland Coastguard was alerted to a diver who had made a 
rapid ascent from 20m.  The casualty was thought to have 
ingested water.  The dive boat reported the diver was unwell 
after completing a 20m dive off Lyme Regis.  The dive doctor at 
Poole recompression chamber was consulted and it was 
determined that the diver was not suffering from DCI.  The diver 
was flown to West Dorset hospital by Coastguard helicopter 
rescue R-106.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2008 08/387 
Brixham Coastguard was alerted to a diver having made a rapid 
ascent, the casualty was transferred to Plymouth by lifeboat, 
taken ashore and transferred to DDRC Plymouth by land 
ambulance.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2008 08/273 
A pair of divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 24m.  
One of the divers signalled to his buddy that he was out of air.  
The buddy took hold of the diver and brought them both to the 
surface.  Their dive duration was 40 min.  At the surface she 
inflated the diver's BCD but they were unable to swim to the 
boat.  A diver in the boat entered the water, swam to them and 
towed the troubled diver back to the boat.  All were safely 
recovered. 
September 2008 08/390 
Shetland Coastguard was alerted to three divers making a rapid 
ascent from 27m.  The parent vessel was met in port by an 
ambulance and all three casualties transferred to Stromness 
hospital for treatment.  (Coastguard report).

Two divers dived to a maximum depth of 17m.  9 min into the 
dive one of the pair experienced a regulator free flow.  He 
swapped to his alternative regulator and then to his pony 
regulator.  He then grabbed the regulator from his buddy's 
mouth.  The buddy placed his own alternative air source in his 
mouth and purged it.  The diver with the free flow then dragged 
the pair of them to the surface.  At the surface the buddy inflated 
the BCD of the diver with the free flow and turned the subject air 
cylinder off.  He then turned the cylinder back on again and they 
swam ashore.  The buddy said that he changed regulators 
because he was breathing an air-water mix.  He could not 
remember why he didn't purge the regulator nor that he had 
taken his buddy's main regulator from his mouth.  No 
subsequent ill effects were reported. 
May 2008 08/089 
A diver was dropped next to a shot buoy but struggled against 
the current and was swept away.  He was recovered into the 
boat and dropped back again.  In both cases he was dropped 
well up current. 
May 2008 08/107 
A diver brought a made to measure drysuit and completed a 
drysuit training course.  She had concern that the neck seal was 
too tight and always had to take care to fit it correctly.  She 
regularly dived with the same buddy and was known to use her 
air faster than the buddy.  On a number of occasions she had 
had to use her buddy's octopus regulator.  This diver and her 
buddy conducted a wreck dive after a long RHIB ride to the dive 
site.  They planned a no stop dive to a maximum depth of 29m.  
She failed to alert her buddy when she reached 100 bar as had 
been previously agreed.  With 6 min of no stop time remaining 
she noticed that she only had 50 bar remaining, she indicated 
this to her buddy, the dive leader, and they deployed a delayed 
SMB to make their ascent.  Their ascent was slow, with a stop at 
23m to fasten a torch to the dive leader's BCD.  At 20m the diver 
who was low on air ran out and took her buddy's octopus 
regulator.  She got mouthfuls of water and was unable to purge 
it.  She began to panic.  Her buddy passed her her pony 
regulator and she was able to breathe from this.  The dive leader 
then took hold of the troubled diver and began a controlled 
buoyant lift.  They made a brief stop at 5m and the dive leader 
noticed that the troubled diver was hyperventilating and not 
responding rationally.  The dive leader was attempting to reel in 
the SMB line as well as control the buoyancy of both of them.  
They made a rapid ascent to the surface from 5m.  At the 
surface the troubled diver was gasping for air.  The dive leader 
signalled the boat and they were recovered into it.  The troubled 
diver was placed on nitrox 64 and the Coastguard was informed.  
The diver was conscious but not fully aware of her surroundings.  
Once ashore she was met by both a land and an air ambulance.  
She was taken to hospital and treated for potential secondary 
drowning.  She had no symptoms of DCI.  Subsequent to this 
event she had a larger neck seal fitted to her drysuit.  It was later 
found that the troubled diver had not been fully trained on the 
use of a purge valve to clear a mouthpiece and the dive leader 
had not previously conducted a controlled buoyant lift with both 
divers in drysuits. 
May 2008 08/095 
To make their ascent from a dive two pairs of divers deployed 
two delayed SMBs.  Both became tangled in the shotline and 
were abandoned.  These SMBs were subsequently recovered. 
May 2008 08/093 
A rebreather diver aborted a dive when he accidentally changed 
the equipment's set point and used up all his oxygen. 
May 2008 08/298 
Three divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 32m.  In 
line with the pre-dive plan the diver with least gas indicated when 
he reached 100 bar.  The diver leader indicated that they would 
continue for 3 more minutes before ascending.  2 min later the 
diver indicated that he was down to 80 bar.  The third diver 
deployed his delayed SMB and indicated that they should 
ascend.  The diver who had had 80 bar was then seen inflating 
his BCD to ascend but then deflating it again.  The dive leader 
indicated that he should put air into his BCD, this he did but then 
vented it again.  The third diver then handed the SMB reel to the 
dive leader and started to lift the diver who was low on air using 
a controlled buoyant lift.  During the ascent the diver who was 
low on air took the dive leader's octopus regulator.  They arrived 
safely at the surface.  Their dive duration was 25 min.  The diver 
who was low on air later stated that he had been continually 
dumping air from his BCD because he was concerned about 
making a rapid ascent; it is thought that nitrogen narcosis played 
a part in this.  No subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
July 2008 08/163 
A diver entered the water by jumping from a large dive boat.  As 
he surfaced after the jump a second diver jumped in without 
checking that the way was clear.  The second diver landed on 
top of the first one.  The second diver was wearing a twin-set 
with a stage cylinder.  The stage cylinder hit the control knob on 
the cylinder valve of the first diver and sheared it off, damaging it 
beyond repair.  No injuries were reported. 
July 2008 08/293 
A pair of divers dived to a maximum depth of 35m using air.  
They then ascended to 20m, made a stop at 18m and ascended 
to 6m.  They spent a total of 54 min at this depth with the last 30 
min on nitrox 50.  Their total dive time was 67 min.  After the dive 
one of the divers' computers showed 'Er'; the diver was not fully 
familiar with the computer.  They thought that they had missed 
10 min decompression although the other diver's computer 
showed no missed stops.  They were placed on oxygen, but no 
symptoms developed and no further action was taken. 
July 2008 08/217 
Two pairs of divers made an ascent up a shotline from a depth of 
24m.  They had no decompression stop requirements.  One of 
the divers was over-weighted and pulled the shotline down giving 
them the impression that they were ascending.  The small shot 
buoy was pulled down to 18m and both pairs descended to the 
seabed.  A delayed SMB was deployed and both pairs used this 
to ascend.  One of the divers was low on air and he and another 
diver ascended directly to the surface and the over-weighted 
diver was assisted to the surface by the fourth diver.  The over-
weighted diver was down to 20 bar when he reached the 
surface. 
August 2008 08/220 
A diver entered the water and immediately signalled that he 
wished to be recovered.  He had entered the water without fully 
closing his drysuit zip.

November 2007  08/033 
Two divers entered the water to dive to a maximum depth of 
27m.  The octopus regulator of one of the pair began to free 
flow.  He was able to stop it and the divers descended.  At 18m 
on the descent the regulator started to free flow again.  The 
divers proceeded to the bottom but the regulator continued to 
free flow.  The diver gave the out of air signal to his buddy.  The 
buddy gave the diver his main regulator and switched to his 
own alternative regulator.  They ascended to 15m at which point 
the diver who had the free flow switched to his own pony 
regulator.  They made a normal ascent to the surface including 
a 3 min safety stop at 4m.  Neither diver suffered any 
subsequent ill effects. 
February 2008 08/105 
A rebreather diver prepared his set for a dive and went through 
the normal checks.  He noted that it was 'sluggish' to calibrate.  
He descended a shotline and, at about 10m, switched to a set 
point of 1.3 bar.  He heard the oxygen valve operating but the 
oxygen partial pressure only rose to 0.9 bar where it stopped.  5 
min into the dive he bailed out onto open circuit and returned to 
the surface safely.  The sensor cells in the rebreather were at 
the end of their service life and he had planned to have the set 
serviced the following month. 
April 2008 08/148 
Three divers were laying guide ropes on the seabed in a 
maximum depth of 9m.  During this activity large amounts of air 
began to escape from the contents gauge hose of one of the 
divers.  He switched to his pony regulator.  The divers secured 
the lines on the seabed and made a normal ascent.  The divers 
were safely recovered into their boat.  Subsequent examination 
revealed that the gauge connection to the hose had become 
unscrewed by two full turns.  The hose had been fitted five days 
earlier. 
May 2008 08/096 
A rebreather diver conducted dive to 60m.  During his ascent he 
was decompressing at 10m when his rebreather suffered a cell 
failure.  He bailed out onto an open circuit backup system and 
completed his decompression.  He surfaced without problem. 
May 2008 08/097 
A diver was descending at the beginning of a dive when his 
computer failed to switch on at 6m.  He aborted the dive. 
May 2008 08/098 
A rebreather diver was diving inside a wreck.  He snagged his 
drysuit on part of the wreck and suffered a partial flooding of the 
suit. 
May 2008 08/100 
A diver was preparing for a dive when the diver's regulator 
began to free flow.  The regulator was replaced. 
May 2008 08/101 
A diver was deploying a delayed SMB when the reel jammed.  
The diver ascended safely using their buddy's SMB. 
 
June 2008 08/154 
Two divers were diving on a wreck.  One of the divers lost a 6 
kg weight from his integrated weight system, but did not know 
that this had happened.  As he reached the top of a flight of 
steps inside the wreck he realised that he was buoyant and he 
kept rolling to one side.  As they rose to the top of the wreck he 
had to hold on to a railing to prevent himself ascending.  He 
indicated the problem to his buddy using a slate and then 
fastened the line from his delayed SMB reel to the wreck.  
Using this line he was able to prevent a buoyant ascent and he 
and his buddy ascended at the correct speed and made a 
decompression stop at 5m.  Another diver found and recovered 
his missing weight.  He experienced no subsequent ill effects. 
July 2008 08/159 
A rebreather diver entered the water and attempted to descend 
but then discovered that he had forgotten his weight harness. 
July 2008 08/162 
At the end of a dive a diver attempted to deploy a delayed SMB.  
The reel jammed and was pulled from her hand.  A secondary 
SMB was deployed without further incident. 
August 2008 08/218 
A diver entered the water and attempted to descend.  She was 
unable to do so and returned to the boat for an extra 2kg 
weight.  She then completed a normal dive. 
August 2008 08/219 
A diver planned a dive of 1 hour duration.  The dive duration 
overran by 20 min but he had sent up a delayed SMB so his 
location was known.  Once back in the boat he stated that he 
had been unable to change his computer during decompression 
to follow the decompression gas used and he had stayed at the 
decompression stop until the computer had cleared. 
August 2008 08/221 
A diver deployed a delayed SMB to make his ascent.  The line 
snagged and he released the buoy.  A second delayed SMB 
was deployed and the diver surfaced normally. 
August 2008 08/223 
A diver entered the water and immediately requested to be 
recovered into the boat.  A large hole was found in the wrist 
seal of her drysuit. 
August 2008 08/309 
A diver entered the water and started down a shotline.  At a 
depth of about 6m his cylinder came loose and dropped down.  
He was negatively buoyant for the descent and the inflator of 
his BCD was pulled behind his back and out of his reach.  He 
pulled himself back up the shotline.  At about 3m the regulator 
was pulled from his mouth but he managed to pull himself to the 
surface.  At the surface he struggled to get his head out of the 
water to breathe.  His buddy gave him his octopus regulator and 
then supported the loose cylinder.  They were safely recovered  
into  the  boat.   The diver reported  that the cylinder

had been correctly fastened except that the spare strap had not 
been tucked into its loop.  He stated that he later realised that 
he could have inflated his drysuit or dropped his weightbelt but 
he thought about neither at the time.

A diver deployed  a  delayed  SMB  from  the top  of  a wreck to 
make his ascent.  The SMB reel jammed and he let go of the 
reel.  He deployed a second delayed SMB and made a normal 
ascent.

December 2007 08/023 
Three divers commenced a dive to a maximum depth of 40m.  At 
the surface one of the three experienced problems with a stuck 
open dump valve but was able to rectify it.  At 25m the same 
diver had problems with his main regulator and he switched to 
his octopus regulator.  He had the second stage of this regulator 
upside down but that did not create a problem.  Below 30m the 
visibility was poor and one of the three became separated from 
the other two.  The pair ascended into clearer water but could 
not find the third diver.  They returned to the surface following a 
sloping bottom upwards.  The missing diver deployed a delayed 
SMB and made his ascent.  At the surface it was discovered that 
this diver's computer indicated that he had missed 4 min of 
decompression stops.  The computers of the other two divers did 
not indicate a problem.  Their total dive time was 40 min.  No 
symptoms developed and no further action was taken.  It was 
thought that the computer of the diver who had apparently 
missed stops may have been in error or set incorrectly.

A solo diver was diving near the launch point of a lifeboat without 
an SMB.  The lifeboat crew received a 'Mayday' call but were 
unable to launch because of the presence of the diver's bubbles.  
The lifeboat crew tried to signal the diver by banging on the 
structure of the station but the diver did not respond to this 
signal.  Another diver, who had been diving nearby, dived down 
to the problem diver and indicated to him to surface.  The 
problem was explained and both divers cleared the area.

Shetland Coastguard received a request for medical advice for a 
diver who was diving with two computers, one saying he was 
alright the other saying he should have DCI.  The diver wanted to 
get himself checked out.  (Coastguard report).

Dover Coastguard was alerted to two divers in difficulty following 
a dive to 33m.  The divers were transported to Whipps Cross 
hospital by ambulance.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2008 08/260 
An instructor and two trainee instructors planned a wreck dive to 
a maximum depth of 29m.  A comprehensive brief was 
conducted and the divers entered the water and made their 
descent down a shotline.  One of the trainee instructors led the 
descent and checked regularly that the group was together 
during the descent.  However, at the bottom of the shotline the 
trainees discovered that the instructor was missing.  They re-
ascended and found the instructor back in the boat.  The 
instructor had let go of the shotline to adjust his equipment and, 
in low visibility with a current running, he lost contact with the 
shotline and deployed a delayed SMB to make his ascent.

Overseas Incidents 
 
 
Fatalities 
 
March 2008 08/056 
A party of ten divers was diving in the area of some underwater 
caves.  Two divers failed to surface.  A extensive search was 
made involving surface craft, a helicopter and an ROV but the 
divers were not found.  (Media reports). 
May 2008 08/068 
Four pairs of divers entered the water from an RHIB to dive in 
an area with a maximum depth of 15m between an island and 
some off lying rocks.  During their dive one pair realised that 
they were in the wrong place and moving in the wrong direction 
so they surfaced.  They made a normal ascent and spoke 
normally to each other at the surface.  Their dive duration was 
16 min.  One of the pair then disappeared.  Her buddy climbed 
onto some rocks and signalled the boat.  The skipper was in the 
process of recovering other divers; he abandoned this task and 
went to assist.  After a brief search the skipper recovered the 
remaining divers and they returned to the diver who was on the 
rocks.  This diver confirmed that he was alright and explained 
what had happened.  The boat made a search of the immediate 
area then took up a position where a 'Mayday' call could be 
made.  The boat then returned, picked up the diver from the 
rocks and continued the search.  They were joined by a lifeboat, 
a helicopter and other craft.  A snorkel search and then a 
search by divers was made but the missing diver was not found.  
The following day the missing diver's body was recovered by 
police divers, from the seabed, close to where she had gone 
missing. 
May 2008 08/070 
A guide and four divers started down a shotline to a wreck.  
One of the divers realised that he had forgotten his computer 
and he returned for it.  Once back underwater they continued 
the dive.  The guide led them into the wreck, through some tight 
passages and down a ladder.  They then re-ascended a ladder 
way and re-entered the engine room.  Here they discovered that 
two divers had become separated from the rest of the party.  
The guide returned to look for them but came back.  The guide 
and remaining divers left the wreck through a damaged area 
and searched around for the missing pair, they then returned to 
the shot and made their ascent which included 8 min of 
decompression stops.  The divers who had separated from the 
others had become disorientated in low visibility inside the 
wreck, due to disturbed silt.  They became separated from each 
other and one of the pair ran low on air.  He switched to his 
pony regulator and was then able to see daylight through a hole 
in the wreck.  He made his way though this hole and ascended 
without any stops.  The missing diver did not surface and the 
guide re-descended with a spare cylinder to search for him.  
The diver was not found and the guide had to be treated for 
DCI.  Subsequent searches failed to find the missing diver. 
May 2008 08/079 
A number of pairs of divers entered the water and descended a 
shotline to a wreck.  Their plan was to swim along the wreck at 
a depth of 36m to 40m.  On entry, a diver from one pair missed 
the shot buoy and had to be brought back by boat; his buddy 
waited at the shot buoy.  Once the diver was back at the buoy 
they started their descent.  The buddy went down first and the 
diver who had been swept from the buoy was slower because 
he had trouble with his ears.  When he reached the wreck he 
could see his buddy swimming around the wreck some distance 
from the shotline, but he was not looking in his direction.  Due 
to the problems at the surface the diver who had descended 
slowly was quite low on air so he conducted a short dive in the 
vicinity of the shotline and then made his ascent; he expected 
his buddy to join him at the decompression station.  However 
the buddy failed to appear.  Another diver from the group had 
missed the wreck and was surfacing under a delayed SMB.  
The surface cover thought that this would be a pair of divers 
and it was not until this lone diver surfaced that they realised 
that one of the party was missing.  A surface search was 
organised down current from the wreck.  Two other divers 
entered the water to search around the wreck site.  The 
authorities were alerted and an air search was conduced over 
the following two days.  Other divers found the missing diver's 
body caught in netting near the propellers twelve days later and 
it was recovered after a further two days.  The missing diver 
and his buddy had agreed before the dive that they would not 
necessarily wait for each other.  The cause of death was found 
to be due to a serious heart condition which led to heart failure 
during the dive. 
 
 
 
 
Decompression Illness 
 
October 2007 08/300 
A diver conducted a 31 min dive to a maximum depth of 35m 
including a 1 min stop at around 4m.  About 3 hours later he 
dived to 35m for 36 min with a 1 min stop at about 4m.  Some 
time later he complained of blurred and tunnel vision.  He was 
placed on oxygen and diving medical advice was sought.  After 
20 min the symptoms had resolved and no immediate further 
action was taken.  The diver made no further dives until he had 
seen a diving medical specialist.  He was found to have a large 
PFO and at the time of reporting was waiting for an operation to 
close it. 
October 2007 08/186 
A diver conducted a series of dives over a 5 day period.   On 
the fifth day she dived to 33m for 66 min with a 4 min stop at 
6m.  Later that day she dived to 27m for 55 min with a 7 min 
stop at 6m.  1 hour later she noticed an itching and a rash on 
her upper arms.  This progressed to become red patches on 
her stomach, kidney area, upper thighs and shoulders.  She 
was placed on oxygen when the first symptoms appeared and 
the symptoms were fully resolved after 6 hours.  Subsequent 
tests revealed that she had a large PFO.  She had had previous 
skin related DCI. 
December 2007 08/025 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 85m using 
trimix 14/50.  At the end of the dive they ascended to 36m using 
trimix making a total of 10 min of stops at depths between 54 
and 36m.  They switched to nitrox 36 and ascended to 15m 
making a total of 13 min of stops at depths between 33 and 
15m.  They then switched to nitrox 70 and ascended to the 
surface making a total of 47 min of stops at depths between 12 
and 6m.  Their total dive duration was 113 min.  About 20 min 
after leaving the water one of the pair felt some discomfort in 
his left shoulder.  30 min later this developed into a light joint 
pain in his shoulder and elbow.  At first he thought that this was 
muscular strain but an hour later the pain worsened.  He was 

 
 
NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2008

placed on oxygen and diving medical assistance was sought.  
The diver attended a local hospital but they were inexperienced 
in diving problems and he did not get the attention he required.  
He then transferred to a naval facility where he was treated for 
type 1 DCI.  His treatment commenced 7 hours after he left the 
water.  The divers reported that they were well rested and 
hydrated before the dive. 
June 2008 08/207 
Two divers using trimix rebreathers conducted a 55 min dive to 
a maximum depth of 56m including 20 min of decompression 
stops.  After this dive one of the pair developed a rash across 
his chest and stomach.  Later this diver became confused and 
he was laid down, placed on oxygen and given fluids.  He was 
pale and sweating, a large patch of skin on his right-hand side 
had a marbled appearance and he was clenching his left fist.  
An ambulance was called.  The oxygen and fluids improved his 
condition.  He was taken to hospital and recompression was not 
thought to be required.  The rash faded but his skin remained 
sore and his blood pressure remained low.  Heat exhaustion 
and dehydration were diagnosed.  On discharge from hospital 
he felt bloated and his lymph nodes were enlarged and sore.  
Further diving medical advice suggested that he may have 
suffered a lymphatic DCI and recompression was being 
considered.  
 
 
 
 
Illness / Injury 
 
October 2007 08/012 
A diver conducted a 48 min dive to a maximum depth of 18m.  
After this dive she developed a headache but didn't inform 
anyone.  She had had difficulty clearing her ears at the start of 
this dive.  2 hours later she made a second dive.  30 min into 
this dive she indicated that she had a headache and wanted to 
ascend. They started their return to the shore and made a 
safety stop at 6m. During this stop the troubled diver removed 
her mouthpiece and vomited.  The stop was abandoned and 
both divers surfaced.  The diver was removed from the water.  
She was shivering and she was wrapped in dry towels.  She 
was placed on oxygen and after about 45 min she had made a 
good recovery. 
January 2008 08/071 
Two divers entered the water from an RHIB to dive on a wreck, 
there was a current and they descended quickly; one above the 
other.  They were some distance from the wreck and had to 
swim to it.  The wreck had an upper and a lower portion and the 
dive plan was to dive the upper portion at a depth of less than 
40m.  However, the divers had mistakenly arrived on the lower 
portion of the wreck in a depth of 38m.  Once on the wreck the 
lower of the two divers looked around for his buddy but could 
not see him; in fact he was directly above him.   He assumed 
that the diver had proceeded down the wreck and he swam 
down to find him.  He swam down so quickly that his buddy felt 
that he would not be able to catch him.  After a while the diver 
realised that there was no lower portion.  At this point the dive 
guide, who had chased down after him, arrived and signalled 
that they should ascend and the guide inflated the diver's BCD.  
He made a buoyant ascent and, surrounded by bubbles, was 
unable to read his computer.  He looked at the depth gauge on 
his other arm and thought that it read less than 0m.  This gauge 
was calibrated to a maximum depth of 40m and was, in fact, 
well off the scale at about 70m; almost all the way around the 
dial back to zero.  The diver reached the surface after a dive to 
71m for 11 min.  He was recovered into the boat and placed on 
oxygen.  The other divers made a normal ascent.  The diver 
stayed on oxygen for 4 hours with a 10 min break every hour.  
He also drank a lot of water.  He suffered no subsequent ill 
effects.  The diver was using nitrox; two instruments recorded 
the mixture as 32% another as 27%.  It is thought that nitrogen 
narcosis played a large part in this incident. 
March 2008 08/146 
An instructor and two trainees were engaged in alternative air 
source and controlled buoyant lift training.  The water surface 
was choppy and, at the surface after their second ascent using 
alternative air sources, one of the trainees suffered a panic 
attack and did not inflate his BCD as briefed.  The instructor 
calmed the trainee down and they agreed to continue.  They re-
descended to 6m and they commenced controlled buoyant lift 
practice.  After completing his lift the diver who had had the 
panic attack started to become distressed again.  The instructor 
aborted the session and they began a surface swim to the 
shore.  During this swim the distressed diver complained that 
he was having difficulty breathing.  The instructor assisted and 
ditched the troubled diver's weights.  The instructor then towed 
him to a jetty and assisted him from the water.  Once out of the 
water the diver slowly recovered. 
June 2008 08/153 
Two divers conducted a series of three dives.  The first was to 
33m for 57 min with an 8 min decompression stop.  The 
second, after a surface interval of 1 hour 35 min was to 36m for 
50 min with a 5 min decompression stop.  The third dive, after a 
second surface interval of 1 hour 35 min, was to 31m for 51 
min.  The first two dives were conducted using air and one of 
the divers used nitrox 28 on the last dive.  After the last dive the 
diver who had remained on air complained of feeling tired and 
of aches.  He was placed on oxygen and kept under 
observation.  The diver's condition improved and no further 
action was taken.  It was thought that his problem was due to 
the challenging nature of the day's diving. 
August 2008 08/227 
A diver was in a boat resting between dives; another similar 
boat was tied up alongside.  There was no wind or current and 
the sea was calm.  The diver moved forward to his kit bag and 
while doing so he put one hand on the boat's gunwale to steady 
himself.  The other boat rubbed alongside trapping the diver's 
fingers.  His fingers were quickly freed but his middle and ring 
fingers were found to be fractured and nearly severed and his 
index finger was cut.  First aid treatment was given and the 
diver was taken to a medical facility and then by ambulance to 
hospital.  All three fingers had sustained multiple fractures and 
an operation was conducted to re-attach the two severed 
fingers. 
 
 
 
 
Boating and Surface 
 
April 2008 08/085 
A group of divers were launching a boat into a river.  There was 
a loud explosion and the engine cover was lifted into the air and 
landed on the deck in a small fireball.  The fire was quickly 
extinguished.  Subsequent investigations found that one of the 
fuel hose clamps had become loose.  Fuel leaked into the 
engine housing and ignited when the engine heated up.  No 
injuries resulted. 
 
May 2008 08/193 
A dive boat was returning from a dive when a whale shark was 
seen and the boat moved towards it.  Divers rushed to enter the 

 
 
 ` NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2008 
42  ©BSAC - 2008 
water to snorkel dive with the shark.  After about 30 min the 
snorkelers were recovered and the boat returned to the shore.  
Once ashore it was discovered that one of the divers had been 
left behind.  He was recovered by another dive boat in the area.  
He suffered no ill effects. 
May 2008 08/152 
Two dive boats, one larger than the other, each with four divers 
aboard, were returning to harbour after a dive.  Travelling at 
speed, the larger boat was positioned to overtake the smaller 
boat.  As the distance between them closed the smaller boat 
turned towards the larger boat.  The cox of the larger boat 
attempted a tight turn to avoid a collision.  The cox of the 
smaller boat then also made a tight turn and the larger boat ran 
into the stern of the smaller one.  The small boat was capsized 
and divers were thrown into the water.  The divers were 
recovered from the water and the group then tried to right the 
capsized boat but were not able to.  They then started to tow 
the small boat back to the harbour.  One of the divers who had 
been in the smaller boat complained of pain.  The smaller boat 
was anchored and the casualty was taken ashore.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and the casualty was taken to hospital 
by ambulance.  The casualty was treated for three broken ribs.   
Another boat was used to recover the capsized craft. 
 
 
 
 
Ascents 
 
January 2008 08/035 
Two divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 
20m.  At 20m the visibility was poor and the light was low.  One 
of the divers had a panic attack and started a rapid ascent.  His 
buddy tried to calm him but this increased his panic.  The 
panicking diver got caught on part of the wreck which slowed 
his ascent but increased his anxiety.  His buddy continued to try 
to slow the ascent and he guided him up the boat's anchor line.  
At the surface he was recovered into the boat and placed on 
oxygen.  No subsequent ill effects were experienced and no 
further action was taken. 
March 2008 08/147 
An instructor and two trainees descended a shotline to conduct 
a wreck dive at a depth of 15m.   During the descent one of the 
trainees had a problem with his mask flooding.  He cleared the 
mask but it flooded again.  He was unable to resolve the 
problem and signalled that he wanted to ascend.  He made a 
fast ascent to the surface and the instructor and the other 
trainee followed at a slower pace.  They were all safely 
recovered into their boat.  It was subsequently found that the 
diver had unknowingly been using someone else's mask. 
July 2008 08/165 
A pair of divers dived on a reef to a maximum depth of 33m.  
There was a strong current flowing and they made their way 
around a rock into the current.  They used reef hooks to pull 
themselves along and once in the current they hung on to watch 
the passing wildlife.  They found it hard work to retain their 
position and the divers' breathing rates were faster than normal.  
After 20 min they made their way back around the rock into a 
more sheltered position.  After a 25 min dive time they found a 
sheltered area  at a depth of 12m.   One diver signalled 
 
 
 to his buddy that his air was approaching 50 bar and that they 
should ascend.  The buddy indicated that they should move 
further into the lee of the rock where he started to deploy a 
delayed SMB.  The diver with 50 bar moved around his buddy 
to watch him deploy the SMB.  In doing so he moved away from 
the rock and into an area of rapid water movement.  He was 
swiftly carried away from the rock and downwards.  The water 
movement was so turbulent that he was lost in a cloud of his 
own bubbles.  He realised that he would not be able to get back 
to his buddy and decided to make a solo ascent.  However he 
was still being carried downwards and at 20m he was finning 
hard but not ascending, despite fully inflating his BCD.  Initially 
he held onto his weightbelt to enable him to control his ascent, 
but he was still not able to ascend and his regulator was 
becoming harder to breathe from; he realised that this meant he 
only had a few more breaths.  He ditched his weightbelt and 
finned hard.  He made a rapid ascent to the surface.  He was 
picked up by the boat and placed on oxygen.  His buddy 
surfaced close by.  The diver noted after the dive that he had 
been carrying 2 kg too much weight.  His dive duration was 35 
min and he used his last 50 bar in 3 min. 
 
 
 
 
Technique 
 
April 2008 08/084 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 25m.  
They started their ascent when one of the divers reached 50 
bar.  They made a safety stop at 10m, then deployed a delayed 
SMB and started another safety stop at 6m.  During this stop 
the diver who had had 50 bar ran out of air.  He attempted to 
use his buddy's alternative air source but experienced problems 
with water in the regulator.  They both surfaced.  The diver who 
had run out of air stated that his computer had gone into an 
error mode and he asked to be put on oxygen.  The other 
diver's computer was showing only a fast ascent warning.  No 
symptoms developed and no further action was taken.  The 
diver believes that in his panic he may have placed the buddy's 
alternative air source in his mouth upside down. 
May 2008 08/149 
Two divers conducted a wreck dive for 40 min to a maximum 
depth of 29m.  After a surface interval of 1 hour 45 min they 
made a second dive on the wreck.  They retrieved an anchor 
from a depth of 28m and then, 17 min into the dive, they 
entered the wreck.  However, they did not enter the wreck in the 
planned location and found themselves in an enclosed part of 
the wreck.  They continued into the wreck and then they 
became disorientated which led to a separation.  One of the 
pair found a narrow opening in the wreck and removed his 
cylinder and BCD to get through.  Once outside he refitted his 
kit and swam to their initial entry point.  He attached a line and 
started to search inside the wreck for his missing buddy.  After 
a dive duration of 38 min his gases were running low and he 
made a rapid ascent to the surface to alert the surface party.  
The second diver had been unable to find an exit and was 
forced to switch to his decompression cylinder.  His torch 
battery then ran out.  His eyes then became accustomed to the 
darkness and he was able to see a faint light which led him to 
an exit.  He made a three minute ascent to the surface.  The 
first diver's dive duration was 44 min and the second diver's 
dive duration was 60 min.  As the second diver surfaced other 
divers were about to enter the water to search for him.  Both 
divers were placed on oxygen and taken to hospital.  Neither 
diver suffered any subsequent ill effects.

A diver was at a depth of 28m when his regulator started 
making 'bubbling' noises.  He indicated the problem to the dive 
leader  and  moved  closer  to his buddy.    The  regulator  then 
 
 
began to free flow.  He shared air with his buddy and they made 
a safe ascent to the surface including a 3 min safety stop.  
Once out of the water the rubber cover of the first stage was 
found to have developed a large bulge.  The regulator was 
returned to the manufacturer and the diver was awaiting their 
report.
