 ` NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2002 
 
Introduction 
 
This booklet contains the 2002 Diving Incidents Report, produced by The British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC) in the 
interest of promoting diving safety.  It is important to note that it contains details of UK diving incidents occurring 
to divers of all affiliations, plus incidents occurring worldwide involving BSAC members.  
 
Report Format 
The majority of statistical information contained within this report is also shown in graphical form.  Please note that all 
statistical information is produced from UK data only and does not include Overseas Incidents unless noted as ‘All 
Incidents’. 
 
The contents of this report are split into an overview of the year, and then the details of nine incident categories plus some 
historical analyses.  The various sections can be found as shown below:- 
 
 i) Overview Page  1 
 ii) Fatalities Page 5 
 iii) Decompression Incidents Page  7 
 iv) Injury / illness Page  18 
 v) Boating & Surface Incidents Page  23 
 vi) Ascent Problems Page  28 
 vii) Technique Problems Page  32 
 viii) Equipment Problems Page  34 
 ix) Miscellaneous Incidents Page  35 
 x) Overseas Incidents Page  36 
 xi) Numerical & Statistical Analyses Page  38 
 xii) List of Abbreviations Page  40 
 
 
Within each category the incidents are listed in the order of their occurrence, not necessarily that of Incident Reference.  
They are laid out in the following form: 
 
  MONTH/YR OF INCIDENT  INCIDENT REF.    
  Brief Narrative of Incident.................................................................................... 
  ........................................................................................................ 
 
The nature of many diving incidents is such that there is usually more than one cause or effect.  Where this is the case the 
incident has been classified under the more appropriate cause or effect. For instance an incident involving a fast ascent, 
causing decompression illness, will be classified under 'Decompression Incidents'.

Overview 
 
has seen a levelling in the total number of 
incidents that have been reported.  In the 2002 
incident year (October 01 to September 02 
inclusive) 432 incidents have been analysed, compared with 
458 in 2001, and 418 in 2000. 
We are very confident that we record all UK incidents involving 
a fatality since these are high profile events involving the 
emergency services.  Information from these sources, together 
with that provided by our members, coaches, and press articles, 
ensures that we are alerted to all UK diving deaths. 
We can be equally sure that we do not have a full record of all 
of the other types of incident.  If the emergency services are not 
involved and if those involved do not send in details of an 
incident then it will go unrecorded.  It is impossible to assess 
just how many incidents are unrecorded but it must be a 
significant number.  Thus, apart from the fatalities, this report 
should be treated as a sample of the types of problems that 
divers encounter, not a definitive record. 
  
The distribution of reported incidents is shown in the following 
chart.  As can be seen, 65% of these incidents have occurred in 
the summer period.  This is totally consistent with previous 
years, reflecting the increased number of dives that take place 
during the warmer weather.  The peak in June is slightly 
abnormal, and it seems to be largely due to an unusually high 
number of boat engine failures.  It is quite possible that many 
boats were put back on the water in June, after being unused 
through the winter, and without being correctly prepared.

Incidents by category 
The incident database categorises all incidents into one of nine 
major categories, and the following chart shows the distribution 
of the 2002 incidents into those categories.  
 
The highest number of incidents relates to ‘Decompression 
Illness (DCI)' and this represents a change from the pattern of 
recent years.  In three of the last four years 'Boating and 
Surface' incidents has been the largest category of incidents.  
Over the previous four years these incidents have accounted for 
29% of the total number of reported UK incidents.  This year 
this percentage has fallen to 22%.  'Boating and Surface' 
incidents typically involve engine failures and/or lost divers 
(often the two are related), and the BSAC has repeatedly 
highlighted the importance of correct engine servicing and of 
carrying and use of surface marker and detection aids to 
prevent divers from becoming separated from their boats; let's 
hope that this reduction in the number of incidents reflects a 
growing awareness of the importance of these issues.  
 
Whilst 'Boating and Surface' incidents have reduced, incidents 
relating to 'DCI' have grown dramatically.  In the four years from 
1998 to 2001 the average number of DCI incidents reported 
was 105 per year.  In the 2002 incident year this number grew 
to 144, an increase of 37%.  Now we know that we do not 
capture all of the DCI incidents in the database and some of the 
increase could simply be better reporting, but my belief is that 
this category has shown a concerning increase over previous 
years.   
An analysis of DCI incidents is included later in this overview.

Fatalities 
The 2002 incident year started out looking as if it might become 
a very bad one for fatal incidents with 2 deaths in November 01 
and 3 in December 01.  When you consider that fatalities in 
December are quite unusual you will understand why, in 
January this year, we were predicting a gloomy outcome for the 
year.  Fortunately this prediction did not come true, indeed the 
2002 incident year has seen a significant improvement over 
previous years.  When we closed the database at the end of 
September there had only been 14 fatal sports diving incidents 
in the UK.  Of these only 4 were BSAC members. 
The high number of fatalities in the last quarter of 2001 has 
been more than offset by a reduced number of fatalities in 
2002, with a total of 9 in the first three quarters of the year. 
 
The causal factors behind the UK fatalities can be summarised 
as follows:- 
• Six cases involved depths greater than 50m.   
Two of these involved solo diving. 
One involved a rebreather. 
One involved a buoyant ascent from depth. 
• One case involved a diver who suffered a heart attack after 
becoming unwell in a swimming pool. 
• Three cases involved separation.  In two of these cases the 
casualty was later found unconscious underwater. 
• Two cases involved divers panicking because of problems 
with mask and regulator. 
• One case related to a rapid ascent precipitated by a 
problem with a delayed SMB. 
• One case where there is simply insufficient information to 
be able to draw conclusions.

 ` NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2002 
2        ©BS-AC - 2002 
In previous reports I have highlighted a trend of increasing 
safety within our membership and this year's figures continue to 
support these findings.  When we look at the number of BSAC 
fatalities per ten thousand members a falling trend can be seen 
from 1980 onwards.  During this period our fatal incident rate 
has been halved.  Considering that in the same timeframe we 
have seen the advent of faster boats and better equipment that 
have greatly expanded the boundaries of adventurous diving, 
this increase in safety is something for which all BSAC 
members should take credit.   
 
 
BSAC members' fatality rate 
 
 
At the time of writing (mid November 02) I am unaware of any 
UK fatality so far in the last quarter of the year.  So, barring a 
disaster in the last 6 weeks of the year (and the Christmas 
period is usually very quiet), the 2002 calendar year will go on 
record as the one of the safest in recent years.   
Latterly diving has received some heavy criticism for its 
worsening safety record and I trust that this greatly improved 
statistic will receive as much attention.   
 
I always feel a little awkward when commenting on improving 
fatality trends, clearly each one of these events is a tragedy and 
the target should be zero.  We certainly must not be 
complacent, but equally we should recognise when 
improvements to safety are indicated. 
 
 
Incident depths 
The following chart shows the maximum depth of the dives 
during which incidents took place, summarised into depth range 
groupings. 
 
The pattern of depths in the 0 to 50m range is very similar to 
that normally seen and reflects the amount of diving that takes 
place in these depth ranges.  However the number of incidents 
reported in the greater than 50m ranges continues to grow.  22 
incidents involve dives to greater than 50m and this is the 
highest number ever recorded in this category.  Of these 22  6 
(27%) were fatalities.  The message is very clear – Diving at 
depth brings much greater risk and deep incidents are far more 
likely to be serious ones. 
 
The BSAC advises that no air dive should be deeper than 50m, 
and that dives to 50m should only be conducted by divers who 
are appropriately trained and qualified.   
The recommended limit for divers trained to Sports Diver 
standard is 35m and then only when they have received 
appropriate training for diving at this depth.

The next chart shows the depth at which the incident started.  
Inevitably the data is biased towards the shallower depths since 
many incidents happen during the ascent or at the surface.  
Critical among these are the DCI cases where almost always 
the casualty is out of the water before any problems are noted.  
This partially explains the large occurrence of ‘Surface’ cases 
as this includes divers with DCI who have left the water. 
Other surface incidents involve boats and boating incidents.

Although the data suggest that divers at the level of Sports 
Diver are the most prone to problems one must be careful in the 
interpretation of these data.  The picture is clearly distorted by 
the numbers of members that we have at each of these grades.  
It is very probable that the largest single group of members are 
Sports Divers, hence the high incidence of problems.

An analysis of incident by diver qualification shows that no 
grade of diver, from novice to instructor, is immune to problems.  
It is all too easy to make the assumption that only inexperienced 
divers get into problems, but the chart shows that this is not so. 
 
The distribution of these qualification data conforms to the 
pattern seen in previous years. 
 
 
Divers’ use of the Emergency Services 
Divers’ use of the rescue services shows a monthly distribution 
aligned to the distribution of all incidents, and is clearly 
correlated with the number of dives that are taking place.  Our 
demands upon the Coastguard service were inline with those of 
recent years.

Our call upon the RNLI in the 2002 incident year is down on 
previous years.  Over the previous four years the RNLI has 
been involved in an average of 120 incidents per year, this year 
it was only 95.

Divers’ requirements for SAR helicopters was significantly 
higher than in previous years.  The average over the preceding 
four years was 87 recorded incidents involving a helicopter, this 
year it was 114. 
Helicopters are tasked to support searches for missing divers 
and to transport divers with DCI to recompression facilities.  As 
mentioned earlier, cases of DCI have increased significantly in 
2002 and this will have contributed to the rise in helicopter call 
outs.

Decompression Incidents 
The BSAC database contains 144 reports of DCI incidents in 
the 2002 incident year, some of which involved more than one 
casualty.  When these multiple cases are counted the result is 
168 cases of DCI. 
In 2001 116 cases of DCI were recorded, 134 in 2000 and 86 in 
1999.  As stated earlier, the 2002 increase is worrying. 
 
An analysis of the causal factors associated with these cases 
indicates the following:- 
57 involved diving to deeper than 30m 
40 involved rapid ascents 
30 involved missed decompression stops  
22 involved repeat diving 
Some cases involved more than one of these causes. 
 
Incidents involving HM Coastguard:  208 
Incidents involving helicopters:  114 
Incidents involving lifeboats: 95 

 ` NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2002

The report includes several cases of ‘Diver illness’ reported by 
the RNLI and whilst the nature of this illness is not recorded by 
the RNLI it is very likely that these are further cases of DCI. 
 
As reported many times before, poor buoyancy control is at the 
heart of the majority of these cases.  Divers are failing to 
correctly control their ascent, especially in the critical last 10m 
zone and ending up with rapid ascents and/or missed 
decompression stops.  Very often the diver is using a drysuit 
and is unable to prevent a buoyant ascent. 
 
Delayed surface marker buoys (SMB) have been implicated in a 
number of incidents including at least one of the fatalities.  
Typical problems are loss of buoyancy control whilst deploying 
the SMB, jammed reels, tangled lines and free flowing 
regulators.  These problems can result in a rapid ascent to the 
surface.  The very piece of equipment that is supposed to 
increase the safety of an ascent is having just the reverse 
effect.   
Clearly much more training and practice is required in the use 
of this system.  If possible the reel should be fastened to the 
bottom (rock or wreck) during the deployment and it should not 
be attached to a diver so that, in the last resort, it can simply be 
abandoned if there is a problem.   
 
The safest ascent will always be with a correctly deployed 
shotline but this, of course, is not always appropriate or 
possible. 
In Conclusion 
Key conclusions are:- 
• A continuation in the trend of increasing safety for BSAC 
members as indicated by the fatality rate of BSAC members 
over the last 20 years. 
• 2002 calendar year is anticipated to have the lowest UK 
fatality rate for many years. 
• A reduction in the number of boating and surface incidents. 
• A significant increase in reported cases of DCI. 
• A continuing increase in the number of incidents related to 
very deep diving. 
 
Most of the incidents reported within this document could have 
been avoided had those involved followed a few basic principles 
of safe diving practice.  The BSAC has recently published the 
latest revision to the booklet 'Safe Diving'.  This is available to 
all, free of charge. 
 
Remember you can never have too much practice and the 
further you stay away from the limits of your own personal 
capabilities the more likely you are to continue to enjoy your 
diving. 
 
Please read the detailed reports in this booklet carefully and 
use them to learn from others’ mistakes. They have had the 
courage and generosity to record their experiences for 
publication, the least that we can do is to use this information to 
avoid similar problems. 
 
Finally, if you must have an incident please report it on our 
Incident Report form, available free from BSAC HQ or via the 
BSAC website.   
 
As always, your anonymity is assured – great care is taken to 
preserve the confidentiality of any personal information 
recorded in BSAC Incident Reports.

Fatalities 
 
November 2001 02/009 
Three divers conducted a dive to a depth of 60m.  One of the 
divers did not return to the surface.  A search took place 
involving a police helicopter, police divers and an ROV.  The 
diver's body was recovered the following day from a depth of 
95m.  It is thought that the diver had been on a ledge at 60m 
and had somehow dropped down to 95m.  (Newspaper report 
only). 
November 2001 02/016 
Three divers began their dive by descending a shotline.  At 27m 
they passed a group of four divers who were ascending the line.  
During this maneuver the regulator of one of the three was 
knocked from his mouth.  This diver attempted to recover the 
regulator but ended up using his pony cylinder regulator and 
decided to return to the surface.  This diver was recovered into 
the boat.  The other two continued to the bottom of the shot.  
The depth was 31m and the visibility approximately 3m.  They 
watched a lobster for a short time but then realized that the third 
diver was not with them.  They looked around for him and then 
one of the pair signaled that they should return to the shotline.  
However visibility was now low due to disturbed silt.  The divers 
faced each other and agreed to surface.  At 15m one of the pair 
prepared to deploy his delayed SMB.  During this time they 
became separated.  The diver with the SMB looked around and 
then made his way to the surface.  His total dive time was 13 
min.  He was recovered into the boat.  The third diver did not 
resurface.  The Coastguard was alerted and an extensive 
search was conducted.  This diver was not found. 
December 2001 02/024 
A group of divers were engaged in a night dive.  It is believed 
that one of the group surfaced when a torch failed and that he 
then re-descended.  Later, this diver was found unconscious on 
the seabed at a depth of 10m.  His torchlight aided his location.  
He was recovered from the water and resuscitation techniques 
were applied.  The casualty was taken to hospital by ambulance 
but failed to recover.  His dive computer indicated a maximum 
depth of 16m.  When found, his weightbelt was in place and his 
air cylinder contained 60 bar.  (Newspaper report only).

December 2001 02/037 
A group of three divers became separated during a dive.  One 
surfaced and raised the alarm.  Other divers entered the water 
to search and one of them found the missing pair at a depth of 
39m.  One was unconscious with no weightbelt and the other 
was attempting to lift him to the surface.  The casualty had no 
buoyancy and the other diver was not able to lift him.  The 
rescuing diver used his own drysuit direct feed to put air into the 
casualty's drysuit.  They were then able to lift him to the surface.  
Other divers assisted and he was brought to the shore.  The 
casualty was not breathing and had no pulse.  Resuscitation 
techniques were applied.  The emergency services were alerted 
and the casualty was airlifted to hospital but he failed to 
recover. 
December 2001 02/038 
A party of five divers undertook a dive to 50m.  One of the group 
failed to return to the surface.  Members of his party and others 
conducted a search for him but were not successful.   His body 
was recovered the following day by police from a depth of 55m.  
(Newspaper report only). 
February 2002 02/062 
A diver was spotted floating motionless just below the surface of 
a quarry by people passing near by.  These people alerted 
three other divers in the area who went to assist.  They climbed 
down a steep slope and pulled the diver to the shore.  He had 
no regulator in his mouth and showed no signs of life.  They 
removed the diver's cylinders.  They noted that he had two 
contents gauges, one reading 160 bar and the other 140 bar.  
They were able to inflate his drysuit and BCD.  They also noted 
that his computer recorded a maximum depth of 57m, that a 
stop at 12m had been missed and that an alarm was sounding.  
They were unable to land him on the steep slope so another 
diver towed him to a landing point.  The rescuing diver 
administered EAR during the tow.  The emergency services 
were alerted.  The diver was landed and oxygen assisted 
resuscitation techniques were applied. Emergency services 
attended the scene but were not able to save this diver.  It 
appears that this diver was diving alone. 
March 2002 02/072 
A diver deployed a delayed SMB.  The dive boat moved 
towards the buoy.  The buoy then disappeared and the diver did 
not surface.  The emergency services were alerted and a 
search initiated.  Very poor weather conditions hampered the 
search efforts.  His body was found 17 days later by police 
using an ROV.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
April 2002 02/087 
A diver was involved in drysuit training in a swimming pool.  She 
lost consciousness underwater.  She was taken to hospital 
where she suffered two heart attacks and died two days later. 
April 2002 02/086 
An instructor and two divers made a dive to a maximum depth 
of 20m.  The regulator of one of the three 'froze' and gave no 
air.  He started to use the alternative air source of one of the 
other two.  It is believed that the donor diver then panicked and 
the regulator of the third diver was knocked from his mouth.  
The diver with the 'frozen' regulator made an ascent to the 
surface and raised the alarm.  Other divers, who were already 
diving in the area, found the donor diver lying, unconscious, on 

  NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2002

his back, on the bottom and the third diver swimming round.  
They noted that his contents gauge read 120bar, but they were 
not able to inflate his BCD or drysuit.  He had a harness type 
weightbelt and they were not able to release this.  They brought 
the unconscious diver to the surface using their own buoyancy.  
The third diver made his way safely to the surface.  The 
casualty was recovered into a boat and resuscitation 
techniques were applied.  He was taken to hospital but failed to 
recover.

May 2002 02/112 
A diver dived to 60m using a rebreather.  He was seen to 
surface and then sink back down.  He did not resurface.  An 
extensive air and sea search was carried out but the diver was 
not found. 
May 2002 02/129 
A diver using tri-mix failed to surface after a solo dive to 60m.  
An extensive search was conducted by helicopter, lifeboat and 
divers but no trace of the missing diver was found.  (Coastguard 
and RNLI reports). 
July 2002 02/170 
A diver was at a depth of 15m conducting mask clearing training 
drills.  He suffered a panic attack and lost consciousness during 
the ascent.  He was recovered into the boat and resuscitation 
techniques were applied during the return to the shore.  They 
were met by an ambulance and resuscitation attempts 
continued.  The diver was taken to hospital but failed to recover.

Two divers surfaced rapidly from a 48m dive, whilst trying to 
deploy their delayed SMB.  The line became jammed at 30m.  
One diver cut the line but both divers rose rapidly to the surface.  
Both receiving lung injury, one was fatally injured.  (Coastguard 
report). 
August 2002 02/249 
Three pairs of divers were diving on a wreck in a maximum 
depth of 66m.  Towards the end of the dive one pair made their 
way to shotline, at the top of the wreck, at a depth of 58m.  At 
this point one of the pair became inverted with too much air in 
the legs of his drysuit.  Despite his buddy's attempts to help, he 
made an inverted ascent to the surface without decompression 
stops.  His dive time was 28 min.  He was recovered into the 
boat and resuscitation techniques were applied.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and he was airlifted to hospital, where 
he was pronounced dead.  The other divers made a normal 
ascent.  Cause of death was pulmonary barotrauma.

Decompression Incidents 
 
 
October 2001 02/296 
Within 10 min of coming ashore, shore diver experienced pain 
in left shoulder.  Drove home, but was persuaded to seek 
medical attention - medical advice obtained by doctor from the 
hyperbaric unit and diver transferred there by helicopter.  First 
dive to 60m, normal ascent, 1.5 hours later - dived 40m for 10 
min bottom time/15min stop.  (Coastguard report). 
October 2001 02/295 
MRCC advised by doctor that he was aware of a diver resident 
at a local hotel in difficulties.  Diver was diagnosed as having a 
type 2 neurological DCI and was apparently unable to stand.  
MRCC requested to alert hyperbaric unit for arrival of diver.  
(Coastguard report). 
October 2001 02/012 
A diver made a 35 min dive to a maximum depth of 36m.  He 
made a slow ascent.  20 min after surfacing he had chest pain, 
difficulty breathing and his lips were going numb.  He was given 
oxygen and taken by helicopter to hospital.  From there he was 
taken to a recompression facility for treatment.  A spinal bend 
was diagnosed. 
October 2001 02/014 
A diver undertook a series of dives to a maximum depth of 45m.  
He then dived to 41m for 53 min which included 22 min of 
decompression stops.  During the ascent from this dive he got 
to 9m and then started to re-descend.  This descent was halted 
at 23m and the diver made his way up to 5m for the 
decompression stops.  The redescent had been caused by 
other divers pulling down on the shotline and sinking the buoy.  
Upon surfacing this diver felt a tingling in his wrist.  His wrist 
had a speckled red rash.  He was placed on nitrox 80 and the 
boat returned to harbour.  The rash extended to include his 
arm.  The emergency services were alerted and he was taken 
by ambulance to hospital on oxygen.  He was then taken to a 
recompression facility for treatment. 
October 2001 02/298 
Dive boat reported two divers having made a rapid ascent from 
in excess of 35m.  Divers were transferred by helicopter to a 
recompression chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
October 2001 02/036 
A diver conducted a 36 min dive to 15m.  3 hours 52 min later 
he dived again to 23m for 49 min with a 2 min stop at 7m.  The 
following day he dived to 16m for 10 min, 13 min later he dived 
to 14m for 33 min, and finally 2 hours 35 min later he dived to 
22m for 47 min with a 1 min stop at 7m.  This diver had suffered 
from diarrhea for 3 days and had drunk little water.  2 hours 
after surfacing from the last dive he noticed a tingling sensation 
in his right arm which spread to his right leg.  He had a meal 
and a beer and the symptoms disappeared.  7 hours after 
surfacing the symptoms returned to his right arm and both legs, 
he also had a tingling on his right scalp.  He was placed on 
oxygen and the Coastguard was contacted.  The diver was 
taken by lifeboat to a recompression facility where he received 
treatment. Another member of the same party conducted a 
similar series of five dives.  20m for 48 min including a 1 min 
stop at 6m, after a surface interval of 3 hours 46 min she dived 
to 23m for 70 min with a 6 min stop at 6m.  19 hours 15 min 
later she dived to 22m for 15 min with a 4 min stop at 6m.  20 
min later she dived to 11m for 20 min with a 2 min stop at 4m 
and then, after 2 hours 35 min, she dived to 24m for 49 min with 
a 3 min stop at 6m.  That evening she noted a pain in her left 
elbow but put it down to a strain.  On the third day she dived to 
25m for 34 min with a 5 min stop at 6m and finally, after an 
interval of 3 hours 6 min, she dived to 17m for 47 min with a 3 
min stop at 6m.  The elbow pain persisted.  The following day 
the pain was still present and she sought medical advice.  She 
was placed on oxygen and transported to a recompression 
facility for treatment which resolved her symptoms. 
October 2001 02/020 
A diver conducted an 18 min dive to a depth of 9m.  4 hours 26 
min later he dived to 21m for 29 min.  During the second dive 
the diver's ascent was delayed due to the deployment of a 
delayed SMB.  During the ascent he developed cramp and 
surfaced missing 20 sec of decompression stop.  Whilst getting 
from the boat to the beach, in surf, the diver fell twice.  After de-
kitting the diver complained of fatigue in his legs.  He later 
received decompression treatment and was expected to make a 
full recovery. 
October 2001 02/059 
Two divers surfaced from a dive having missed decompression 
stops.  The Coastguard was alerted and a lifeboat was tasked 
with taking the most serious case to a recompression facility.  
Whilst this was happening two other members of the dive group 
also experienced symptoms of DCI.  The three remaining cases 
were airlifted to another recompression facility for treatment.  
(Coastguard report). 
November 2001 02/021 
A diver completed a dive to 45m for 70 min including 31 min 
stops.  The diver was using air with nitrox 50 for 
decompression.  Back on the boat she felt unsteady and after 
20 min she developed a rash on her right arm, across her 
shoulders and down her left arm.  After 45 min the rash and 
blotchy skin subsided.  That evening she developed a pain in 
her arm muscles.  She did not dive the following day.  That 
evening she made contact with a recompression facility and 
was given a series of recompression treatments.  This 
treatment resolved her symptoms. 
November 2001 02/433 
Dive RHIB reported diver with DCI symptoms.  Evacuated by 
rescue helicopter to hyperbaric chamber.  No other details.  
(Coastguard report). 
November 2001 02/046 
Three divers conducted a dive to a depth of 34m.  During the 
ascent from this dive, one of the divers became positively 
buoyant and was carried to the surface missing 30 min of 
decompression.  One of the other divers also surfaced with her.  
The third diver completed the planned stops.  The two who had 
missed stops were given oxygen.  The diver who had come up 
with the buoyant diver developed a pain in his shoulder.  He 
sought medical advice and received recompression therapy. 
November 2001 02/027 
A diver conducted a 62 min dive to a depth of 52m including 37 
min decompression.  He dived on trimix and decompressed 
with nitrox 50.  During the dive he became out of breath due to 

  NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2002 
8        ©BS-AC - 2002 
exertion.  At the surface he had a severe headache.  In the boat 
he was placed on oxygen.  20 min later he experienced 
shoulder pain.  The Coastguard was alerted and the diver was 
flown to a recompression chamber.  A 6 hour treatment 
resolved his symptoms.  The diver reported that there were 
(unstated) 'aggravating' factors. 
November 2001 02/080 
Two divers undertook a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 33m.  
When one of the pair was at 100 bar the other signaled that 
they should ascend and started to deploy a delayed SMB.  She 
attached the wrong karabiner to the SMB and whilst the second 
diver inflated the SMB she started to ascend.  To avoid being 
carried to the surface she let go of the reel.  The other diver 
then prepared and deployed her SMB, whilst doing so she 
descended 4m.  At the beginning of their ascent their 
computers indicated the need for a 25 min stop at 3m.  They 
conducted a 6 min stop at 6m.  At this point one of the divers 
had 17 bar remaining and the other was suffering from the cold.  
They made an ascent to the surface missing a 20 min stop at 
3m.  Once back in the boat they were placed on oxygen for 
about 20 min.  The following day one of the pair experienced an 
ache in her knees.  She sought medical advice and was 
directed to a hyperbaric facility where she received 
recompression treatment. 
November 2001 02/028 
A diver completed a 41m dive to a maximum depth of 36m.  An 
hour after the dive he was sick, he had the onset of tingling and 
disorientation.  He was offered oxygen but refused it.  Medical 
advice was sought and the diver was taken to a recompression 
chamber for treatment.  The diver sustained a trauma to his ear.  
It is reported that he was tired before the dive and had drunk six 
pints of beer the night before. 
November 2001 02/052 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 35m for a 
duration of 1 hour.  2 hours later she dived to 20m for 30 min.  1 
hour after this dive she developed an itching red area at the top 
of her arm.  She was advised to drink fluids and seek medical 
advice if it got worse.

December 2001 02/049 
A diver made a 35 min dive to 20m.  1 hour 47 min later he 
dived to 29m for 36 min.  Later, whilst driving home he started 
to experience a burning sensation in his back.  He became 
unsteady and disorientated.  He was driven back to the diving 
centre and medical advice was sought.  He was placed on 
oxygen and airlifted to a recompression facility.  After two 
sessions of recompression therapy his symptoms fully resolved. 
December 2001 02/041 
Two divers conducted a dive to 20m for 31 min including a 2 
min stop at 6m.  At the beginning of the dive they dived to 8m 
then resurfaced before continuing.  3 hours 40 min later they 
dived again, this time to 17m.  At the bottom of the shotline they 
became separated in low visibility.  Both divers started to 
ascend.  Both lost control of their buoyancy and they made fast 
ascents; one to 2m and the other to 1m.  Their total dive time 
was 5 min.  One of the divers experienced a nose bleed and 
was placed on oxygen.  During the journey home he felt a dull 
ache in his left shoulder.  The following morning the ache had 
gone but returned after exertion.  He sought medical advice and 
received two sessions of recompression. 
January 2002 02/031 
A diver completed a 35 min dive to 8m.  2 hours later she dived 
again.  At 6m her regulator began to free flow.  She refused her 
buddy's alternative air source and he dropped her weightbelt to 
bring her to the surface.  At the surface the diver was in distress 
and not able to breathe properly.  She was a mild asthmatic but 
her inhaler did not seem to help.  She was placed on oxygen 
and recovered quickly.  She was taken to hospital for 
examination and then sent to a recompression facility for 
treatment. 
January 2002 02/082 
A diver dived to a maximum depth of 35m.  He made a 2 min 
stop at 6m and surfaced with a total dive time of 45 min.  2 
hours 2 min later he dived again.  This time he dived to a 
maximum depth of 20m and made a 5 min stop at 6m.  His total 
dive time was 52 min.  30 min later he noticed an ache.  Several 
hours later the ache had become a pain and the diver sought 
medical advice.  He was driven to a recompression facility 
whilst breathing nitrox 36 and he received three courses of 
treatment. 
January 2002 02/053 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 22m.  At 16m 
she indicated that she was cold and the dive was terminated.  
The divers ascended and completed a 3 min safety stop at 6m.  
The total dive duration was 23 min.  At the surface the diver 
was unresponsive and rapidly became unconscious.  She was 
recovered into a boat.  She was not breathing and had no 
pulse.  Resuscitation techniques were applied and the diver 
recovered.  She was taken by helicopter to a recompression 
facility for treatment.  She is reported as having suffered a near 
drowning and sustained a lung injury.  A full recovery was 
expected. 
February 2002 02/167 
A diver conducted a 28 min dive to 25m with a 3 min stop at 
6m.  2 hours 41 min later she dived to 35m for 33 min with a 1 
min stop at 6m.  Later that day she suffered from bad 
coordination, slurred speech, the inability to focus on tasks and 
a headache.  She sought medical advice, a cerebral DCI was 
diagnosed and she was recompressed.  30 min into the 
treatment her symptoms resolved. 
February 2002 02/075 
Three divers conducted a dive to 35m.  One of the divers' 
regulator began to free flow.  The dive leader offered his 
alternative air source but this was rejected.  The other diver 
attempted to assist.  The diver with the free flow began to panic.  
The dive leader took control of the situation and brought the 
panicking diver to the surface.  They made a fast ascent and 
the diver with the free flow was without air and unconscious at 
the surface.  The alarm was raised and a boat launched to 
assist.  Resuscitation techniques were applied and the casualty

had regained consciousness by the time the ambulance arrived.  
The casualty was taken to hospital and then to a recompression 
facility for treatment.  He was reported to be making a full 
recovery. 
March 2002 02/078 
Two divers conducted a dive to 20m and then moved onto a 
shelf at 6m towards the end of the dive.  Here they did some 
training drills.  When they left the water one of the divers 
noticed an abnormal feeling in his feet.  Within a few minutes 
his legs 'felt like lead'.  The emergency services were contacted 
and the diver was taken to a recompression facility.  He 
received two sessions of treatment and made a good recovery 
although some residual abnormal sensation remained in his 
feet. 
March 2002 02/091 
A diver conducted a 17 min dive to a maximum depth of 17m.  
During the ascent she became inverted and made a very rapid 
ascent to the surface.  She was given fluids and monitored for 
signs of DCI.  Monitoring was stopped after 12 hours at which 
point she was symptom free.  30 hours after the incident she 
felt unwell and noted a rash on her chest.  She sought medical 
advice and was taken to hospital and from there to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  A neurological DCI was 
diagnosed. 
March 2002 02/095 
A diver conducted a series of ten dives over a seven day period 
with no diving on day two.  On the last day he conducted two 
dives.  The first was to a maximum depth of 29m for a total time 
of 32 min and the second, after an interval of 3 hours 31 min, 
was to 22m for 27 min.  During the ascent from the second dive 
his buddy was too buoyant and they made a faster than normal 
ascent to the surface, missing a planned safety stop at 6m.  4 to 
9 hours after this last dive, the diver felt a minor ache in his right 
shoulder.  18 hours after the last dive he awoke to find the ache 
has worsened and that he had an ache in his right shoulder, left 
elbow and wrist, and a slight numbness and tingling in his 
hands.  He contacted the Coastguard for advice and reported to 
his local hospital.  From there he was transferred to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  His symptoms quickly 
resolved. 
March 2002 02/107 
Two divers conducted a dive to 32m for 30 min with a 3 min 
stop at 6m.  1 hour 42 min later they dived to 22m for 34 min 
with a 3 min stop at 6m.  Later that evening one of the pair 
complained of a severe and worsening pain in his right 
shoulder, blotchy skin on both shoulder blades and numbness 
and 'pins and needles' in his right hand and fingers.  He was 
placed on oxygen and medical advice was sought.  He was 
taken to a recompression facility for treatment.  His symptoms 
were quickly resolved.  His buddy was also recompressed as a 
precaution. 
March 2002 02/096 
A diver conducted a 31 min dive to a maximum depth of 20m.  
After the dive he felt 'pins and needles' in both legs.  He was 
placed on oxygen which eased his condition, but he then felt 
light headed.  He was taken to a recompression facility where 
he received treatment. 
March 2002 02/309 
Following free flow of air, female diver made a rapid ascent.  
Medical advice obtained and dive RHIB transferred casualty to 
hyperbaric unit.   Oxygen administered as soon as DCI 
symptoms appeared.  (Coastguard report). 
March 2002 02/101 
A diver conducted a 10m dive for 23 min and then 5 hours 39 
min later he dived again to 10m for 30 min.  The following day 
he dived to 10m for 25 min and then 4 hours 6 min later he 
dived to 14m for 25 min.  During the ascent from this last dive 
he practiced a controlled buoyant lift on his buddy.  The ascent 
was fast.  During the ascent he got cramp in his left calf.  Later 
that day he noticed a pain in his left elbow.  The pain increased 
and he sought medical advice.  He was placed on oxygen and 
taken to a recompression facility for treatment.  The following 
day he noticed pain in his elbow again and was given a second 
recompression treatment.  This did not resolve the problem and 
a muscle / tendon problem was diagnosed. 
April 2002 02/253 
Two divers made a dive to a maximum depth of 33m.  After 30 
min one of the pair was down to 80 bar and signaled the 
ascent.  They deployed a delayed SMB.  During the ascent, at 
17m, one of the divers lost control of his buoyancy and 
ascended quickly to 12m.  They stopped at 12m to regain 
control.  They started to ascend once more and this diver lost 
buoyancy control again, this time ascending from 8m to the 
surface.  2 hours later he noted a minor pain across his back 
and shoulder blades.  He was placed on oxygen and the 
Coastguard was alerted.  The diver was taken by helicopter to a 
recompression facility where he received five treatments over 
the next two days. 
April 2002 02/313 
Diver developed symptoms within 24 hours after diving two 
dives.  Casualty transferred from hospital to hyperbaric unit.  
(Coastguard report). 
April 2002 02/254 
Two divers conducted a dive to 10m.  Over 3 hours later they 
dived again, with another diver, this time to 22m.  After 35 min 
one of the group deployed a delayed SMB.  During the ascent 
one of the divers who had dived earlier lost control of his 
buoyancy at 16m and rose to the surface in 50 sec.  He 
signaled distress and was recovered into the boat.  His 
computer indicated missed decompression stops.  He was 
placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  The others 
made a normal ascent.  The diver was taken by helicopter to a 
recompression facility for treatment. 
April 2002 02/316 
Two divers reported to have missed decompression stops and 
transferred by nearby dive vessel to hyperbaric unit for 
treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
April 2002 02/318 
One of a party of shore divers had suffered a rapid ascent and 
was experiencing DCI symptoms.  Medical advice obtained and 
casualty transferred to hyperbaric unit by air.  (Coastguard 
report). 
April 2002 02/323 
Shetland CG reported having a decompression incident, no 
further details.  (Coastguard report). 
April 2002 02/116 
Three divers dived to a maximum depth of 36m.  At 20m they 
deployed a delayed SMB.  The buoy sank back down and one 
of the divers became tangled in the line.  The divers made a 
fast ascent.  One of the group tried to slow the ascent and his 
regulator began to free flow.  Their total dive time was 28 min.  

  NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2002 
10        ©BS-AC - 2002 
Two of the divers developed symptoms of DCI and were 
recompressed. 
April 2002 02/322 
Dive vessel reported via VHF Ch16 a diver exhibiting symptoms 
of DCI.  Diver and buddy airlifted to shore where ambulance 
transferred them to recompression chamber.  (Coastguard 
report). 
May 2002 02/326 
Female diver transferred to hyperbaric unit after suffering DCI 
symptoms.  Had dived 13m for 27 min and 14m  for 31 min from 
a rowing boat.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2002 02/126 
A diver suffering from DCI and her buddy were flown by 
helicopter to a recompression facility for treatment.  
(Newspaper report only). 
May 2002 02/286 
Two divers, father and son, were separated on a dive.  Son 
made a rapid ascent and missed some decompression stops.   
Casualty airlifted and father airlifted to nearby ambulance for 
transferal to recompression chamber.  Both divers required 
treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2002 02/327 
Upon surfacing from 19m dive, diver displayed symptoms of 
DCI.  Casualty airlifted and transferred to recompression 
chamber.  Note: Casualty used ventolin inhaler before 
commencing dive.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2002 02/160 
Two divers made a dive to a maximum depth of 30m.  After 24 
min they launched a delayed SMB and began their ascent.  The 
SMB line became tangled on the wreck and the divers 
descended again to free it.  This action caused their 
decompression requirements to increase.  They ascended 
slowly to 6m where they stopped for 1 min.  One of the pair ran 
low on air and used the alternative air source of the other diver.  
Their computers indicated the need for a 12 min stop at 3m but 
they had insufficient air for this.  They surfaced missing 
decompression stops.  One of the divers developed symptoms 
of DCI and was placed on oxygen.  The Coastguard was alerted 
and the diver was taken back to the shore.  The diver was taken 
by helicopter to a recompression facility for treatment. 
May 2002 02/328 
Shetland CG reported a diver with suspected DCI treated in 
ICIT recompression facility, no further details  (Coastguard 
report). 
May 2002 02/193 
A diver conducted a dive to 17m.  During the dive he had 
problems with his mask flooding.  After about 32 min he tilted 
his head back to clear his mask again and his regulator began 
to free flow.  He decided to end the dive and he made an ascent 
to the surface which took him about 4 min.  About 45 min later 
he felt his wrist 'tighten'.  His wrist felt sore but he assumed that 
he had sprained it.  The following day the wrist problem was still 
evident and he sought medical advice.  He reported to a 
recompression facility and he received two sessions of 
treatment which resolved the problem. 
May 2002 02/330 
Shetland CG reported having a decompression incident, no 
further details.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2002 02/132 
A diver spent approximately 15 min at 34m and then ascended 
slowly with a 3 min stop at 3m.  An hour later the diver had a 
skin rash and itching across her shoulder and stomach.  She 
also experienced slight visual problems.  She was placed on 
oxygen, which improved her condition.  She was then taken to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  This diver is believed to 
have a PFO. 
May 2002 02/194 
Three divers made a 35 min dive to 33m with a total of 7 min of 
decompression stops.  The following day, 19 hours later, they 
dived again, this time to 28m for 52 min with a 3 min stop at 
6m.  The divers were using nitrox 36.  About 1 hour 30 min after 
surfacing one of the group complained of an itchy shoulder.  
She was found to have a deep blue and red rash on her left 
shoulder and down the back of her left arm.  She was placed on 
oxygen and the Coastguard was contacted.  Advice was 
obtained from a recompression facility and she was airlifted for 
treatment.  A further 90 min later one of the other two divers 
complained of 'pins and needles' in her legs and a numbness.  
The Coastguard was contacted again and both of the other 
divers were airlifted to the recompression facility.  Both were 
found to have neurological DCI and they too were 
recompressed.  One diver was recompressed twice, one three 
times and the third was recompressed a total of seven times. 
May 2002 02/195 
Two divers made a dive to 28m.  With 3 min of no stop time 
remaining they deployed a delayed SMB.  Whilst doing so they 
lost control of their buoyancy and started to make a rapid 
ascent.  They managed to stop at 17m.  At 15m, one of the 
divers, who was wearing a new drysuit, lost control of their 
buoyancy again and started to ascend rapidly.  The other diver 
attempted to slow them down but they were both carried quickly 
to the surface, missing a planned safety stop.  The ascent from 
15m took 80 sec.  The following day the diver who had tried to 
slow the ascent experienced pains in the joint of one finger.  
She sought medical advice and then went to a recompression 
facility where she received two sessions of treatment.  She 
made a full recovery. 
May 2002 02/127 
Two divers completed a 38 min dive to a maximum depth of 
32m.  They carried out decompression stops as indicated by 
diving tables and a further 2 min as indicated by a computer 
that one of the pair was using.  20 min later, whilst climbing a 
ladder, one of the pair noted a numbness in his leg.  He then 
reported a pain in his spine.  The diver was placed on oxygen, 
laid flat and given fluids.  The boat was maneuvered to a 
position where radio contact could be made with the 
Coastguard and assistance was requested.  The diver was 
taken by boat and then lifeboat to a position where he could be 
picked up by a helicopter.  Both divers were then flown to a 
recompression facility.  The casualty developed balance 
problems.  He was given recompression treatment.  The buddy 
was found to be symptom free.

A trainee and another diver descended to the stern of a wreck.  
They then headed off in the wrong direction and moved into 
deeper water.  At 30m the dive leader decided to deploy a 
delayed SMB and to ascend.  During the ascent he lost control 
of his buoyancy and became caught in the SMB line.  The other 
diver followed.  He was dragged up at a fast rate.  At 15m he

A diver conducted a 39m dive for 35 min with a 10 min stop at 
6m. He was wearing a tight 3mm wetsuit top under his drysuit 
as the suit was leaking.   After this dive he felt a little discomfort 
in his upper right arm.  He put this down to the tight wetsuit top 
and the fact that he had earlier pulled up a 25kg shot from 40m.  
3 hours 32 min later he dived again, this time to 31m for 35 min 
with a 4 min stop at 6m.  After this second dive his arm still felt 
uncomfortable.  Once ashore he sought medical advice and 
went to a recompression facility for treatment. 
June 2002 02/197 
Two divers completed a dive to a maximum depth of 53m.  The 
dive leader used nitrox 25 and the other used air.  They 
deployed a delayed SMB and started their ascent.  They 
ascended quickly to 25m where the dive leader slowed the 
ascent.  The dive leader switched over to his decompression 
gas, nitrox 40.  Whilst doing so he became buoyant and rose 
rapidly.  He was able to stop at 8m and tried to swim back down 
to his buddy.  He became entangled in the SMB line and rose to 
the surface missing stops.   At the surface he summoned help 
from the boat.  He was placed on oxygen.  The SMB line also 
became tangled around the boat's propellers.  The line was cut 
free.  The buddy reeled in the line, attached his lifting bag and 
completed 23 min of decompression stops before surfacing.  
Within 20 min of surfacing, the diver who had missed stops, 
noted the loss of hearing in one ear and a numbness across his 
stomach and down his left leg.  The Coastguard was alerted 
and the diver was airlifted to a recompression facility.  He 
received recompression therapy daily for the following week. 
June 2002 02/147 
Two divers undertook a dive to a maximum depth of 33m.  After 
14 min the dive leader signaled the ascent and deployed a 
delayed SMB.  They started to ascend but at 27m the other 
diver was unable to release air from her drysuit and started a 
buoyant ascent.  The dive leader grabbed hold of her but was 
unable to stop her making a rapid ascent to the surface.  The 
dive leader stopped to conduct the necessary decompression.  
The buoyant diver was recovered into the boat and placed on 
oxygen.  She experienced a tingling in her fingers and was 
taken by helicopter to a recompression facility for treatment.  
She made a full recovery.

Two divers descended to 35m.  At this point one of their 
regulators began to free flow.  Both made a rapid ascent to the 
surface.  The diver with the free flow arrived first and although 
he showed no symptoms he was placed on oxygen.  The 
following morning he developed a tingling in his hands and feet.  
He went to a recompression facility for treatment.  The buddy 
was also examined but not recompressed.  The following day 
the buddy developed shoulder pain and she too was 
recompressed.  She was left with a tingling in her hand which 
resolved within a week.

Three divers descended a shotline to a wreck in a depth of 
38m.  The dive leader had difficulty clearing his ears during the 
descent.  At the bottom they connected a distance line and 
swam along the side of the wreck.  After a while the dive leader 
signaled that they should rise up to the top of the wreck.  One of 
the other divers did not respond.  She was not moving and her 
eyes were wandering.  The dive leader took hold of her and 
brought her back to the shotline.  She took hold of the shotline 
and refused to let go or to ascend.  With the third diver's 
assistance the dive leader forcibly restrained the troubled diver 
and they ascended.  They completed 7 min of decompression 
stops during which the troubled diver was still confused and 
struggling.  They finally surface missing 1 min of 
decompression stop.  Once at the surface they were recovered 
into their boat.  The diver remained confused for 30 min.  The 
dive leader was found to have blood in his mask.  Just under an 
hour after surfacing the dive leader noticed a pain in his right 
leg and the third diver had a pain in his shoulder.  Both these 
divers were placed on oxygen and taken to a recompression 
facility for treatment.

Four divers completed a dive to a maximum depth of 54m using 
trimix 18/45.  They started their ascent after 25 min.  They 
made 1 min stops at 30, 27 and 24m.  They switched to nitrox 
50 at 21m where they made a 5 min stop.  They made 1 min 
stops at 18, 15 and 12m, a 3 min stop at 9m and an 11 min stop 
at 6m.  After a surface interval in excess of 5 hours two of them 
dived again.  They dived to 48m using trimix 21/35 and started 
their ascent after 35 min.  They stopped for 1 min at 27 and 
24m.  They switched to nitrox 50 at 21m where they made a 5 
min stop.  They made 1 min stops at 18, 15 and 12m, a 4 min 
stop at 9m and a 13 min stop at 6m. Shortly after surfacing one 
of the divers noticed that his arms felt achy, with flu-like 
symptoms.  He was placed on oxygen for 25 min.  This relieved 
the symptoms slightly.  He also noted blotches and wiggly lines 
in his vision.  He continued to feel weak and tired.  The 
following morning he still felt weak and had pains in his legs.  
He sought medical advice and attended a recompression 
facility.  He and his buddy were recompressed.

Two divers completed a dive to 36m for 30 min.  The following 
day, 18 hours later, they dived again, this time to 41m.  Their 
bottom time was 25 min with the first stop at 27m and a total 
dive time of 67 min.  They used nitrox 80 from 9m to the 
surface.  Shortly after the dive, one of the pair felt a slight flush 
across his chest and then he became dizzy.  He sat down and 
breathed nitrox 80.  The boat returned to shore.  The diver still 
felt dizzy and was unable to walk.  He was placed on oxygen.  
He began to vomit and the emergency services were contacted.  
He was airlifted to a recompression facility where a neurological 
DCI was diagnosed.  He received recompression treatments 
over the next five days.  A test for a PFO was planned.

Two divers dived to 37m.  At the bottom one of the pair signaled 
ascent.  They returned to the surface.  The diver had a panic 
attack and hyperventilated.  Later that day he successfully 
dived to 15m for 30 min.  The following day he dived to a wreck.  
They swam down the wreck towards the seabed at 45m.  At 
33m the diver again signaled ascent.  His buddy could not calm 
him.  They returned to the shotline.  The diver started to panic 
and made a fast ascent to the surface.  His buddy followed.  At 
the surface he removed his mask and called for help.  The 
buddy towed him to the boat.  He was breathing but incoherent.  
He was assisted from the water.  He was placed on oxygen and 
the buddy breathed nitrox 50.  The skipper alerted the 
emergency services, arranged for other boats to collect the 
remaining divers and returned to the shore.  They were met by 
an ambulance and both divers were placed on oxygen.  The 
buddy developed a muscular pain in his left elbow and was 
taken to a recompression facility for treatment.  The panicked

Following wreck dive depth unknown, diver airlifted by helo to 
Murryfield recompression unit possible DCI.  (Coastguard 
report). 
July 2002 02/202 
A group of four divers completed a 16 min dive to 21m and then 
ascended to 10m to conduct an air sharing drill.  One diver 
used the alternative air source of another and they ascended to 
6m.  This diver then resumed breathing from her own regulator 
and they went back to 10m to swap over.  During the descent 
the diver who had been supplying air heard a bang and then felt 
dizzy, but he continued.  He took the alternative air source of 
his buddy and they ascended once more.  At 6m he was 
breathing very heavily and the donor diver found that her own 
regulator was not giving her enough air.  At one point she 
inhaled water.  She spat out the regulator and prepared to take 
the instructor's alternative air source.  The other trainee 
switched back to his own regulator.  The instructor gave the first 
trainee her own regulator back and it worked correctly.  The 
group then surfaced from 6m in 20 sec.  The following day the 
diver who had inhaled water developed a headache which 
continued into the next day.  On this next day she awoke to find 
her right heel swollen and her big toe painful and tingling.  She 
sought medical advice and attended a recompression facility for 
tests.  A spinal DCI was diagnosed and she received two 
sessions of recompression treatment which greatly improved 
her symptoms.  The other diver experienced ear pain during the 
journey home and he was subsequently diagnosed with a 
perforated eardrum. 
July 2002 02/369 
Two divers surfaced after completing a dive to 30m for 18 min 
with stops.  Recovered by another dive boat, one diver 
developed symptoms of DCI and was visibly sick.  Airlifted to 
recompression chamber in Poole.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2002 02/176 
Three divers conducted a dive to a depth of 28m.  After 22 min 
they deployed a delayed SMB.  One of the divers' crab hook 
jammed the reel and he was dragged upwards.  One of the 
others grabbed hold of this diver and released the jamb and the 
SMB was correctly deployed.  They started their ascent.  Then 
the diver who had been dragged upwards experienced a 
problem with his mask and began a rapid ascent.  One of the 
others followed him for a short distance and then let him go and 
made a normal ascent.  The troubled diver went straight to the 
surface.  The other two completed a 3 min stop at 6m and a 1 
min stop at 3m.  The diver who had made the rapid ascent was 
recovered into the boat and placed on oxygen.  The Coastguard 
was alerted and a helicopter tasked to assist.  The diver 
developed pains in his legs and he was taken to a 
recompression facility where he received a series of 
recompression treatments over a number of days. 
July 2002 02/203 
Two divers conducted a dive to 39m.  After 16 min they 
returned to the shotline to make their ascent.  One of the pair 
pulled the shot weight onto the wreck and attached a lifting bag.  
They made a slow ascent to 6m to complete a 5 min stop that 
was indicated by one of their computers.  Other divers were 
using the shotline and this made it difficult for the two 
decompressing divers to maintain their depth.  With 1 min of 
stops remaining they deployed a delayed SMB and moved 
away from the shotline.  Whilst deploying the delayed SMB they 
lost depth control and approached the surface.  They 
terminated the dive and were recovered into their boat.  Within 
minutes one of the pair developed a headache.  He was placed 
on oxygen.  He became dizzy and nauseous.  The Coastguard 
was alerted and they were met by an ambulance on their return 
to harbour.  The casualty and his buddy were taken to a 
recompression facility.  The casualty received more than one 
recompression treatment.  The buddy showed no symptoms 
and was released.  Dehydration was thought to have been a 
significant factor in the DCI. 
July 2002 02/371 
Diver who was vomiting prior to a dive completed dive to 26m 
for 37 min, missed stops of 9 min at 3m. Diver and buddy 
airlifted to Poole recompression chamber.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2002 02/191 
A diver completed a dive to a maximum depth of 31m for a 
duration of 30 min with a 1 min stop at 6m.  Back on the boat he 
suddenly complained of chest pains and dropped to his knees.  
He was placed on oxygen.  The pain quickly progressed to his 
back and he felt a numbness in his legs.  The boat was met at 
the harbour by an ambulance and the diver and his buddy were 
taken to a recompression facility.  The buddy showed no 
symptoms and was released.  The casualty received a series of 
recompression treatments and was making a slow recovery.  
His computer did not indicate any problems with the dive profile. 
July 2002 02/205 
A diver ascended from a no stop dive to 34m.  At 17m he lost 
control of his drysuit buoyancy and made a faster than normal 
ascent to the surface.  He was unable to dump air fast enough 
from his suit.  Once back in the boat he noticed that he had 
'pins and needles' in his thumb.  The diver was placed on 
oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  Once back ashore he 
was taken by ambulance to a recompression facility where he 
received treatment.

A diver completed a 39 min dive to a maximum depth of 31m; 
her computer did not indicate stops.  3 hours 56 min later she 
dived again, this time to 27m for 36 min and again no stops 
were indicated.  During the dive she suffered a bad neck seal 
leak.  30 min after this dive she began to feel nauseous.  She 
attributed this to sickness suffered during the previous 3 days 
caused by her taking antibiotics.  2 hours later she passed over 
a 300m high mountain pass on her journey home.  She 
experienced hot itchy skin on her upper arm and shoulder; this 
was where the leak had occurred.  The following day she 
sought medical advice and received three recompression 
treatments over the next three days for a neurological DCI.  
Tests for a PFO were planned.

A diver completed a dive to 37m for 36 min with 9 min of 
decompression stops.  2 hours 19 min later she dived again.  
This time to 26m for 37 min with a 2 min decompression stop.  
Back on the boat she felt 'pins and needles' in her left hand, she 
thought that this was due to a tight cuff on her drysuit.  2 hours 
later her shoulder felt sore when touched.  She had a rash and 
bruising on her skin, which spread over her back and trunk.  
She sought medical advice and went to a recompression facility 
for treatment.  The diver was thought to have been dehydrated 
due to an earlier stomach problem and diarrhea.

unwell and lightheaded.  She was placed on oxygen for 50 min 
and the symptoms resolved.  The following morning she had a 
'strange sensation' in her upper arms and back and felt 'muzzy 
headed'.  She sought medical advice and received three 
sessions of recompression treatment.  Her symptoms were 
resolved and she was advised that it was probably the second 
dive which caused the problem.

A diver surfaced from a trimix dive, in a quarry, to a depth of 
106m.  He called for help as he had missed 60 min of 
decompression stops.  Other divers came to his assistance.  
This diver wanted to do in water recompression and was given 
a 10l cylinder with nitrox 40.  A diver from another party 
descended with him to 6m.  The Coastguard and a 
recompression facility were alerted.  A cylinder of nitrox 80 was 
located and taken down to the recompressing diver.  A slate 
was used to communicate with the diver and he expressed 
concern for his buddy.  Bubbles were spotted and two divers 
went to investigate.  They found the other three members of the 
first diver's group decompressing at 17m.  They were low on 
gas and further gas supplies were taken to them by others.  
When the emergency services arrived the diver was brought to 
the surface and placed on oxygen.  He was airlifted to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  The other three divers

Two divers were completing a dive to a maximum depth of 33m.  
At 10m one of the pair noticed that the delayed SMB line was 
caught around his arm.  Whilst resolving this problem the diver 
was distracted and lost control of his buoyancy.  He made a fast 
ascent to the surface missing decompression stops.  His total 
dive time was 34 min.  He was recovered into the boat and 
placed on oxygen.  His buddy made a normal ascent.  The 
following day the diver who had made the fast ascent became 
concerned about DCI and he sought medical advice.  He 
received recompression treatment and his symptoms were fully 
resolved two days later.

September 2002 02/288 
Two divers completed a dive to 40m with a 3 min stop at 3m, 1 
min longer than their computer indicated.  Later one of these 
divers complained of a pain in her shoulder.  She was found to 
have a red rash on her shoulder.  She was placed on oxygen 
and the emergency services were alerted.  The diver and her 
buddy were flown to a recompression facility.  The diver with 
symptoms was given two sessions of treatment.  It is thought 
that the diver's DCI could have been exacerbated by viral 
infection which had caused her to become dehydrated.  She 
was also found to have a ruptured eardrum, although this was 
not considered to be related to this incident.

Injury / Illness 
 
October 2001 02/010 
A diver completed a dive to 30m.  2 hours later she made a 
second dive, this time to 18m.  1 min into this dive she coughed 
her regulator out and would not replace it.  Her buddy brought 
her to the surface.  Some time later she complained of chest 
pain.  She was placed on oxygen and taken to hospital.  She 
received intensive checks and was discharged later that day. 
October 2001 02/011 
A diver made a series of three dives.  First to 19m for 10 min.  1 
hour later she dived again to 21m for 35 min, then a further hour 
later she dived to 21m.  About 15 min into this third dive she 
experienced a problem with her ear and then made a rapid 
ascent to the surface.  Her buddy followed.  At the surface she 
was very distressed and had a lot of pain in her ear.  She was 
placed on oxygen and taken to hospital.  It was discovered that 
this diver had pressurized air trapped in her middle ear.  The ear 
drum was intact.  There were no signs of DCI.  She was 
discharged from hospital the same evening. 
November 2001 02/022 
A diver completed a 20 min dive to a maximum depth of 11m.  
After the dive she was cold and had numb feet and 'pins and 
needles'.  Her neoprene drysuit was very tight.  Her suit was 
removed and she was warmed.  She was placed on oxygen as a 
precaution.  Her symptoms resolved. 
November 2001 02/025 
A trainee diver conducted a series of three dives.  The first to 
20m for 23 min with a 1 min safety stop.  The second dive was to 
19m for 25 min with a 3 min safety stop, and the third to 19m for 
19 min.  The intervals between the dives were 2 hours and 2 
hours and 7 min respectively.  During the third dive he 
experienced problems clearing his ears.  He made a slow 
descent.  At 18 m he indicated a problem with his ear and the 
trainee and his two buddies made an ascent to the surface.  This 
ascent was slightly faster than normal.  On the surface the 
trainee stated that his ear had suddenly become painful at depth.  
There was blood in his mask, his hearing was dull and his ear 
was still painful.  Medical advice was sought and a ruptured ear 
drum was diagnosed. 
November 2001 02/026 
A trainee diver conducted three dives.  The first two were 10m 
for 30 min and 6m for 30 min.  As she descended on the third 
dive she experienced ear pain at 2m and the dive was aborted.  
The diver was taken to hospital and a ruptured eardrum was 
diagnosed. 
November 2001 02/079 
Two divers undertook a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 32m.  
When one of the pair had 100 bar left they settled onto the wreck 
to deploy a delayed SMB.  The SMB line became tangled and 
the diver dropped the uninflated buoy which fell into the wreck.  
They abandoned this buoy and used the delayed SMB of the 
other diver.  By this time they had run into decompression time.  
Whilst ascending they found the SMB midwater.  They put more 
air into the buoy and sent it to the surface.  At the 6m stop one of 
the pair had only 40 bar.  They finished their stops and did a 3 
min safety stop at 3m.  When the dive leader's computer had 
cleared he signaled that they should surface.  Once back in the 
boat it was noted that the other diver's computer showed that 
stops had been missed.  After a surface interval of 1 hour 55 
min, the dive leader dived again to a maximum depth of 17m.  
After 40 min they started their ascent and conducted a 3 min 
safety stop at 6m.  The following day this diver noted a tingling in 
his back and down his left leg.  He sought medical advice and 
attended a hospital.  A trapped nerve in his spine was 
diagnosed. 
December 2001 02/050 
Two divers were descending to a depth of 18m when one of the 
pair experienced a pain in his ear.  They aborted the dive.  The 
ear pain continued. 
December 2001 02/045 
A diver conducted a 26 min dive to 20m.  Later that day he made 
a surface swim to the second dive site.  During the swim he 
became unwell and exhausted.  The dive was aborted. 
January 2002 02/034 
A diver conducted a 33 min dive to 26m.  1 hour and 54 min later 
he dived again, this time to 21m for 28 min.  He then felt ill and 
began to vomit.  He was placed on oxygen for 20 min and 
monitored for signs of DCI. 
January 2002 02/054 
A diver completed a 22 min dive to a maximum depth of 19m.  
After the dive he experienced bruised and swollen hands.  It is 
thought that new cuff seals fitted to his drysuit were too tight.  
After 20 min his hands had recovered. 
January 2002 02/055 
A diver participating in controlled buoyant lift training conducted 
an ascent from 15 to 6m.  She made a second attempt which 
resulted in a fast ascent from 6m to the surface.  At the surface 
she was cold and complained of a headache.  She left the water 
and was placed on oxygen and wrapped in blankets.  She later 
recovered.  This diver had been wearing a semi-drysuit in water 
at 5 deg. C. 
January 2002 02/214 
A diver involved in pool training slipped at the poolside and fell 
into the pool.  Her diving cylinder struck the pool edge and 
damaged tiles.  She was pulled out of the water over the broken 
tiles and received a deep cut to the back and a smaller cut to the 
front of her left leg.  She was taken to hospital for treatment. 
February 2002 02/302 
Report via mobile phone indicating a diver onboard a dive vessel 
had badly lacerated hand and fingers.  Injuries sustained whilst 
diving on a wreck and not wearing gloves.  Casualty taken 
ashore and transferred by ambulance to hospital.  (Coastguard

April 2002 02/115 
A child was participating in a 'try dive' session in a pool.  She had 
grommets in her ears.  She indicated that she wanted to surface 
and complained of feeling dizzy.  She was helped from the pool 
and given oxygen.  Later she again complained of dizziness, her 
respiration rate was increased and she felt cold.  She was placed 
back on oxygen.  Her respiration rate increased and she felt 'pins 
and needles' in her hands and feet.  Her respiration rate rose to 
40 per min and her heart beat to 160 per min.  She breathed into 
a bag to try to slow her respiration rate.  She was taken to 
hospital where a number of tests were carried out.  She suffered 
a seizure.  Drugs were administered and she quickly recovered. 
April 2002 02/106 
Whilst at the surface, a diver struck his head against another 
diver's air cylinder.  His head was cut and he was taken to 
hospital for treatment. 
April 2002 02/317 
Three divers airlifted to recompression facility after raising the 
alarm by whistling, one diver detained after bursting ear drum.  
(Coastguard report). 
April 2002 02/136 
Three divers conducted a controlled buoyant lift training drill from 
6m to the surface at the end of their dive.  They then re-
descended to 6m to repeat the drill.  During the second ascent 
the diver who was acting as the casualty felt that they were 
ascending too quickly and his ears would not clear.  He felt very 
dizzy.  At the surface his ears would still not clear and he went to 
see his doctor.  A slight inflammation was found but no 
perforation.  Two weeks later his ears were normal and he dived 
again. 
April 2002 02/114 
Three divers entered the water from a dive boat.  One was slow 
to enter and rolled on top of another diver hitting her head.  All 
divers were recovered from the water and the diver who had hit 
her head was found to have a bruise but was otherwise well.  
She did not complete the dive. 
April 2002 02/319 
Concern for diver with sinus bleeding.  Medical advice obtained 
and recommendation to see GP on return to shore.  (Coastguard 
report). 
April 2002 02/324 
Medical assistance required for injured diver close to shore.  
Casualty recovered by ILB and transferred to care of awaiting 
ambulance crew.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2002 02/119 
A trainee completed his first open water dive and was conducting 
a surface swim prior to his second dive when he suddenly 
became very breathless.  The instructor towed him to the shore.  
He was given oxygen and an ambulance was called.  A blood 
clot on the lungs was diagnosed and it was stated that this was 
not caused by diving. 
May 2002 02/123 
Three divers commenced a dive to a maximum depth of 10m.  At 
the bottom, one of the group indicated a problem with her air 
supply.  One of the other divers located the troubled diver's 
alternative air source and offered it to her, but this was refused.  
She then signaled that the troubled diver should take her 
alternative air source but she could not release this.  She 
therefore gave her own regulator and attempted to use her 
alternative air source.  The alternative air source was not easily 
accessed and she was only able to use it upside down.  Short of 
air she began to panic, signaled an ascent and swam to the 
surface.  The third diver followed her to the surface and then 
returned for the second diver.  She found her lying unconscious 
on the bottom.  She was not able to replace the casualty's 
regulator.  She brought her to the surface using a controlled 
buoyant lift.  At the surface she began to give AV.  The first diver 
to surface had raised the alarm and another diver swam out to 
help, she took over and continued tow and AV.  The casualty 
vomited and began to breathe.  The casualty was brought 
ashore and placed on oxygen.  The emergency services were 
called and she was taken by helicopter to hospital from where 
she was discharged the following day. 
May 2002 02/122 
After a 30 min dive to a maximum depth of 22m a diver 
complained of feeling very faint and unwell.  He was placed on 
oxygen for two 10 min periods with a 5 min break in the middle.  
This greatly improved his condition.  A contaminated air fill was 
thought to be the cause. 
May 2002 02/124 
Two divers began a descent.  They were unable to reach their 
shotline because of a current, so they descended without the 
line.  At 20m it became very dark and at 30m one of the pair 
became agitated because they had not reached the bottom.  He 
had hold of his BCD control and his depth gauge and he wanted 
to turn his torch on.  His buddy shone his torch into his face and 
this made it harder for him to see.  He indicated that he wanted 
to ascend.  He began to feel 'quite paranoid' and started to get 
into a 'dreamlike state'.  He became convinced that his buddy 
was continuing to descend and decided to ascend alone.  He felt 
that he was losing control and still sinking.  He released his 
weightbelt and tried to remove his BCD.  He blew out most of the 
way to the surface.  His depth gauge showed that at one point he 
had been at 48m.  The buddy surfaced alone, making 3 min of 
decompression stops on the way.  He too had dived to 48m.  
Both divers were recovered into the boat and the diver who had 
made a rapid ascent was placed on oxygen.  The boat's radio 
had failed so they returned quickly to the shore.  The Coastguard 
was alerted by phone and the casualty was taken by helicopter 
to hospital.  He showed no signs of DCI.  It is believed that the 
diver had suffered from nitrogen narcosis. 
May 2002 02/150 
A diver made a dive to 15m for 43 min with a 3 min stop at 3m.  
After the dive he complained of tingling and numbness in his left 
hand and arm.  He had had new seals fitted to his drysuit and 
the wrist seals were very tight.  He was placed on oxygen and 
monitored.  After several hours he was rechecked, no symptoms 
were found and no further action was taken. 
May 2002 02/450 
Lifeboat launched to help with medical call.  One person landed.  
(RNLI report). 
May 2002 02/333 
Female diver airlifted to hospital after displaying respiratory 
problems upon surfacing from a 26m dive. Not thought to be 
related to decompression.  (Coastguard report). 
 
 
May 2002 02/134 
Three divers conducted a dive down an underwater cliff face to a 

  NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2002 
20        ©BS-AC - 2002 
depth of 50m.  On the ascent their computers indicated that no 
stops were required once they had reached 12m.  They 
conducted a 3 min safety stop between 6 and 3m.  Whilst 
traveling home, one of the divers noted a dull ache in his right 
thigh.  Later he had a similar pain in his left bicep for about 5 
min.  He was placed on oxygen and sought medical advice.  He 
was taken to a recompression facility where he received a 
precautionary recompression treatment.  The diver had fallen 
earlier in the day and it was considered likely that it was this fall 
rather than a DCI that caused the symptoms. 
May 2002 02/145 
Three divers made a shallow dive, then, 2 hours 20 min later 
they dived again.  They descended to a depth of 18m.  One of 
the divers noticed that he had water in his mouth.  He became 
apprehensive and settled on to the bottom to regain control.  He 
found himself sliding down an incline and more water was 
present in his mouth.  He tried to purge the water without 
success.   He signaled ascent and put some air into his drysuit.  
He dumped air to control his ascent and rose slowly.  He then 
felt the urgent need to breathe and put more air into his suit.  He 
did not remember any more about the ascent until he found 
himself at the surface.  His total dive time was 7 min.  The other 
divers followed, with one of them trying to slow the ascent.  At 
the surface the troubled diver was sick.  He was recovered from 
the water, placed on oxygen and taken, by ambulance, to 
hospital.  A small reddened area was found inside his right elbow 
joint and he was taken, by ambulance, to a recompression

Two divers were in an RHIB preparing to dive.  One of the pair 
had difficulty locating a BCD strap, she stood up and her buddy 
assisted her.  She then moved towards the rear of the boat to 
continue kitting up.  She was wearing her cylinder and 
weightbelt.  She slipped on the wet floor of the boat and fell 
backwards landing by the transom.  As she fell she received an 
injury to her right knee.  The dive was aborted, other divers were 
recovered from the water and the casualty was taken to hospital 
for treatment.

After diving on air to 27m (54 min) female diver complained of 
cold, sickness and 'pins and needles' in hands.  Medical advice 
sought and transferred from nearby harbour to local hospital for 
check up.  All OK.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2002 02/153 
A diver using a neoprene drysuit experienced problems with the 
buoyancy of his legs.  He bought some ankle weights and made 
a second dive.  During his second dive he lost control of his 
buoyancy, became inverted and made a rapid ascent to the 
surface.  At the surface his buddy was unable to get his face out 
of the water.  Other divers tried to help but could not right him.  
He was assisted from the water and he was not breathing.  
Resuscitation techniques were applied and the diver was airlifted 
to a recompression facility for treatment.

Two divers entered the water from a charter boat.  They rolled 
into the water as directed by the skipper.  One of the divers' legs 
was struck by the propeller, which was rotating.  He shouted for 
help and was recovered into the boat.  He had a serious 
laceration to the back of his right thigh.  There was no first aid kit 
or oxygen available.  A knife strap was used as a tourniquet to 
stem the blood flow.  The diver was in shock and having 
problems breathing.  The Coastguard was alerted and a lifeboat 
which was on exercise in the area was sent to assist.  The 
lifeboat crew rendered first aid and escorted the boat back to 
harbour.  The diver was taken by ambulance to hospital. 
June 2002 02/159 
A trainee and an instructor made a 20 min dive to 6m.  During 
the ascent, at the end of the dive, the trainee lost control of her 
buoyancy and rose very rapidly to the surface.  At the surface 
she was very distressed and coughing up blood-stained sputum.  
She was recovered from the water and placed on oxygen.  An 
ambulance was called and she was taken to hospital.  From 
there she was taken to a recompression facility for treatment.  
She made a full recovery. 
June 2002 02/180 
A diver performed a 17 min dive to a maximum depth of 38m.  1 
hour after surfacing he complained of increasing discomfort in 
his shoulder and elbow.  He was placed on oxygen and the 
Coastguard was alerted.  The boat returned to the harbour from 
where the casualty was flown, by helicopter, to hospital.  It was 
determined that he had not suffered a DCI and he was released. 
June 2002 02/181 
A trainee diver surfaced with chest pains.  He was recovered 
from the water and given oxygen.  An ambulance was called.  
The diver was examined and no problems were found.  The diver 
refused to go to hospital.  A tight fitting wetsuit was thought to 
have been the cause of the problem. 
July 2002 02/466 
Lifeboat launched to help with medical call.  One person landed.  
(RNLI report). 
July 2002 02/186 
A diver completed a dive to 21m and then undertook alternative 
air source drills from 10 to 6m.  Several ascents and descents 
were made.  During the last ascent his ear 'clicked'.  The diver 
left the water and his ear appeared to have been damaged.  He 
was advised to seek medical assistance. 
July 2002 02/185 
After a 28 min dive to a maximum depth of 22m a diver 
experienced slight bleeding from his ear.  He had had no 
problems during the dive except for noting a 'pop' on the ascent.  
He went to hospital where slight damage to his ear canal, but no 
perforation of the eardrum, was found. 
July 2002 02/192 
A pair of divers dived to a maximum depth of 21m.  One of the 
pair was seen at 15m by a nearby diving instructor to be 
struggling to breathe properly.  He went to her assistance, but 
could not calm her down.  He could not see her buddy and sent 
his own buddy to look for her whilst he brought the troubled diver 
to the surface.  The dive duration was 16 min.  The diver was 
placed on oxygen and taken by helicopter to hospital.  No injury 
was found and she was released later that day.  The problem is 
believed to have been hyperventilation.

July 2002 02/473 
Lifeboat launched to assist diver with illness. One person 
brought in.  (RNLI report). 
July 2002 02/211 
A pair of divers dived to a maximum depth of 23m.  12 min into 
the dive one of the divers experienced water entering her 
mouthpiece, she switched to her octopus alternative air source 
but this had the same problem.  She tried to swim to the surface.  
Her buddy prevented her and offered his alternative air source.  
She refused this and then lost consciousness.  The buddy 
brought the casualty to the surface using a controlled buoyant 
lift.  They made a rapid ascent.  The casualty was recovered into 
the boat.  She was not breathing.  She had a slow pulse and 
froth coming from her nose and mouth.  AV was applied and the 
casualty quickly started to breathe spontaneously.  She was 
placed on oxygen and regained consciousness within 10 min.  
The Coastguard was alerted and the casualty was brought 
ashore and then airlifted to hospital for treatment. 
July 2002 02/223 
An instructor and two trainees entered the water down a slipway 
and swam to a buoy.  They descended to a platform at 6m.  They 
began to conduct training drills.  One of the trainees then started 
to pull herself up the buoy line.  The instructor signaled that she 
should let go of the line and she fell backwards onto the platform.  
The instructor took hold of the diver and, using her BCD, brought 
her to the surface.  The other trainee stayed with them.  At the 
surface the instructor inflated the distressed diver's BCD.  She 
spat out her regulator and said that she had had difficulty 
breathing.  A boat was summoned and she was taken to the 
shore.  She was placed on oxygen but still had difficulty 
breathing.  The emergency services were alerted, she was taken 
by ambulance and then helicopter to hospital.  X rays revealed 
the accumulation of air in her stomach.  She was released the 
following day.  Inspection of her regulator revealed a small split 
in the mouthpiece and it was thought that this led to her inhaling 
a water mist which led to air in her stomach. 
July 2002 02/285 
Two divers entered the water.  One of the pair lost his 
mouthpiece and swallowed some water.  They moved to the 
shotline and waited there a while for the diver to recover.  They 
started their descent and the diver experienced problems 
clearing his ears.  They reached the wreck at a depth of 31m.  
The diver then indicated to his buddy that he was not happy and 
wanted to ascend.  They ascended slowly to 20m.  At this point 
the diver took hold of his buddy's BCD.  His eyes were partially 
closed, the colour had left his face and he had almost stopped 
fining.  The buddy took hold of him, and inflated his own BCD 
bringing them quickly to the surface.  The divers were assisted 
into the boat.  Their total dive time was 14 min.  Once in the boat 
the diver quickly recovered.  He was subsequently examined in 
hospital where an X-ray indicated air in his chest cavity.  
Specialist advice subsequently suggested that this diver's 
inability to clear his ears, due to a partially blocked eustachian 
tube, might have contributed to the incident. 
August 2002 02/226 
A diver was participating in a deep diving training course.  Soon 
into the dive, at a depth of 36m, the trainee failed to respond to 
signals.  He then spat out his regulator.  The instructor replaced 
the regulator and purged it.  He then brought the trainee to the 
surface.  The trainee recovered and was placed on oxygen.  He 
is believed to have suffered from nitrogen narcosis. 
 
August 2002 02/395

A trainee diver surfacing from a dive to 6m.  She scraped her 
hand on a wall and suffered a deep cut to the palm of her hand.  
She was not wearing gloves.  She went to hospital for treatment. 
August 2002 02/273 
Two divers completed a 20 min dive to 25m.  One of the divers 
was climbing a ladder back into the boat when his weightbelt 
suddenly fell free.  The weightbelt fell onto the other diver who 
was waiting at the foot of the ladder and struck her on the head.  
She received a cut to her head. 
September 2002 02/242 
Two pairs of divers descended a slope to a depth of 15m.  At this 
point one of the divers felt dizzy and indicated that she wanted to 
ascend.  One of the other divers brought her to the surface.  At 
the surface she was distressed and was sick.  She was 
recovered from the water, placed on oxygen and then taken by 
ambulance to hospital.  She was kept in overnight for tests.  An 
ear problem was suspected. 
September 2002 02/269 
A diver conducted a mixed gas dive to 70m.  He switched to the 
wrong gas at 30m.  This gas had too high an oxygen content and 
he suffered a convulsion.  His buddy sent him to the surface and 
he was recovered unconscious into the boat.  He was airlifted to 
a recompression facility where he recovered after treatment.  
(Newspaper report only). 
September 2002 02/424 
Following a shore dive with four other buddies, female diver 
sustained a bump on the head from unknown source, assisted to 
shore by a jet skier, no medical attention required.  (Coastguard 
report). 
September 2002 02/283

7m.  Shortly afterwards one of the pair felt slight 'pins and 
needles' in his hands.  He quickly recovered. 
September 2002 02/282 
Two divers completed a 40 min dive to a maximum depth of 20m 
with a 1 min stop at 6m.  After the dive one of the pair felt sick 
and was given oxygen.  He subsequently recovered.

September 2002 02/281 
A group of divers made a dive to 30m.  During the descent one 
of the group inhaled water and this caused him problems 
breathing.  He decided to abort the dive and made a hurried 
ascent to the surface as his breathing was becoming 
increasingly difficult.  At the surface he was not breathing but 
responded to resuscitation.  He was airlifted to a recompression 
facility for treatment and was then admitted to hospital from 
where he was released two days later. 
September 2002 02/475 
A diver discovered a block of dense, white, clean material whilst 
diving on a wreck, he did not realize that this was phosphorous. 
 
He placed it in his BCD pocket to investigate later.  This diver 
then missed decompression stops and was placed on oxygen 
and the emergency services were alerted.  Because of these 
events he forgot about the phosphorous.  Exposed to air, it 
started to oxidize in his BCD pocket.  After 30 min dense 
volumes of white smoke were seen to be coming from his BCD.  
Another diver picked up the BCD to throw it overboard.  The 
phosphorous exploded scattering burning fragments around the 
deck.  The drysuit of the diver who had picked it up was engulfed 
in flames, several large pieces landed on his back and another 
diver received extensive burns to the back of his hand that will 
require skin graft treatment.  The diver whose suit was on fire 
jumped into the sea with his drysuit round his knees to extinguish 
the flames.

March 2002 02/100 
A group of divers conducted dives from two RHIBs at two 
different wreck sites.  One of the boats' radio was not working 
and they agreed to keep in touch using mobile phones.  Whilst 
keeping station on a wreck the engine of one of the boats kept 
cutting out.  There was a current and the boat had to keep 
maneuvering.  Whilst recovering their divers the engine cut out 
again and would not restart.  They attempted to phone the other 
boat but got a messaging service.  A third boat saw the problem 
and began to tow them to a harbour.  They eventually made 
phone contact with the other boat and this second boat towed 
them back to their starting point.  The Coastguard was alerted 
but no emergency services support was required. 
March 2002 02/256

Craft and twelve persons brought in.  (RNLI report). 
June 2002 02/201 
A group of divers loaded equipment on to a dive boat in 
preparation for a day's diving.  The divers noted that there was 
little freeboard at the back of the boat where there were stern 
doors.  They traveled to the dive site and on the way water 
came in the back of the boat and flowed across the decking.  
One of the boat's engines cut out and the skipper decided to 
return to the harbour.  Water was now reaching the cabin doors.  
A little later water entered the cabin and the skipper contacted 
the Coastguard, he also radioed for an RHIB to come out to 
assist them.  The divers attempted to bail the water out and 
they put overboard any diving equipment that would float.  The 
RHIB arrived and diving cylinders were passed into it.  Water 
then began to enter the forward cabin and the second engine 
cut out.  The lifeboat arrived and attempted to pump out the 
water, but it was flowing in too quickly.  Everyone climbed onto 
the lifeboat.  A line was attached to the swamped dive boat 
which then sank.  The boat was later salvaged  and further 
diving equipment was recovered. 
June 2002 02/182 
At an inland dive site, divers and windsurfers were using the 
water at the same time.  Site rules stated that every dive group 
should carry an SMB and that other water users should keep at 
least 20m from an SMB.  One of a group of three divers 
became separated from the group, and the SMB, and surfaced 
50m away.  A sailboard traveling at speed missed this diver by 
1m.

Dive boat reported having ran aground on a sand bar, ILB 
tasked, eventually the RHIB re-floated in own time.  
(Coastguard report). 
August 2002 02/289 
Two RHIBs were returning from a dive.  Their route took them 
close to shore and in a location where there was wind against 
tide.  They found themselves in large and confused waves.  
One of the boats made it through into calmer water but the 
other was capsized, throwing the four people on board into the 
water.  The other boat maneuvered to meet up with them in 
calmer water.  The capsized boat's anchor had deployed and a 
diver entered the water to cut this line.  The boat was then 
righted and towed back to the shore.  All persons returned 
safely. 
August 2002 02/233 
Two pairs of divers made a drift dive in a depth of 10m.  The 
first pair surfaced and took over control of the boat, allowing the 
pair in the boat to dive.  When this last pair surfaced they could 
see the boat a long way off but they were not seen by those in 
the boat.  The sun was low in the sky and this made them 
difficult to see.  When it was realized that they were overdue the 
emergency services were alerted and a helicopter and a 
lifeboat were tasked to search.  The divers were quickly located 
and safely recovered into their boat.  They had been using an 
SMB but the boat crew had lost sight of this soon after they 
dived.

Ascents 
 
October 2001 02/013 
22 min into a dive to 21m a diver lost control of her buoyancy 
and made a rapid ascent to the surface.  She experienced a 
nosebleed but no other ill effects. 
October 2001 02/051 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 22m.  At 11m 
she lost control of her drysuit buoyancy and made a fast ascent 
to the surface.  Total dive time was 25 min.  The diver, who was 
new to drysuit diving, suffered no ill effects. 
November 2001 02/023 
Two divers made a dive to 30m.  After 2 min one of the pair had 
difficulty breathing and they made a rapid ascent to the surface.  
No subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
November 2001 02/299 
Diver surfaced missing decompression stops (due to lack of 
weight).  Displayed no symptoms, put on oxygen for 30 min 
after consulting with diving officer and told if no symptoms 
within 24 hours, all should be OK.  (Coastguard report). 
November 2001 02/061 
A diver made an emergency ascent from 20m.  He was 
transferred by lifeboat to a recompression facility for 
observation.  (Newspaper report only) 
January 2002 02/032 
A diver was at a depth of 24m.  His drysuit cuff dump did not 
dump air and he made a rapid ascent to the surface.  No 
subsequent ill effects were reported. 
January 2002 02/068 
Two divers conducted a dive to a depth of 19m.  One of the pair 
planned to practice breathing from his BCD emergency 
cylinder.  He switched over to the BCD air supply and after 
about 1 min he switched back to his normal regulator.  During 
this process he rose off the bottom and he inverted to swim 
back down.  He was buoyant and started to ascend.  He 
attempted to dump air from his BCD.  He righted himself at 13m 
and again tried to dump air, but the BCD had no air in it.  At 
10m he fully opened the auto dump valve on his drysuit but he 
was unable to stop the ascent.  He was carried to the surface.  
His total dive time was 10 min.  His computer showed no error.  
He was recovered into a rescue boat and taken to the shore.  
His buddy surfaced 3 min later.  No subsequent ill effects were 
experienced. 
February 2002 02/073 
Two divers undertook a dive to a maximum depth of 15m.  At a 
depth of about 8m they conducted a training drill using an 
alternative air source.  During this practice one of the divers 
swallowed some water, started to panic, and made a rapid 
ascent to the surface.  No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
March 2002 02/305 
Rapid ascent by two divers who had started a normal ascent 
from 24m.  Problem occurred at 11m, when one of divers lost 
control of his buoyancy equipment .   Both divers airlifted to 
shore for transferal by ambulance to hyperbaric unit.  
(Coastguard report). 
March 2002 02/090 
Two divers dived to a maximum depth of 21m.  At 20m the 
regulator of one of the pair began to free flow.  They made a 
faster than normal ascent to the surface.  No subsequent ill 
effects were experienced. 
March 2002 02/092 
Two divers were diving at 34m when the regulator of one of the 
pair began to free flow.  He made a controlled ascent to 15m, 
using an alternative air source, then a fast ascent to the 
surface.  No ill effects were experienced. 
March 2002 02/093 
Two divers were diving at 35m when the regulator of one of the 
pair began to free flow.  They made a rapid ascent to the 
surface.  Both divers were placed on oxygen.  No ill effects 
were experienced. 
March 2002 02/104 
Three divers failed to conduct the required decompression 
stops and the Coastguard was alerted.  The divers were flown 
by helicopter to hospital.  At hospital they were placed on 
oxygen.  No symptoms of DCI were found.  (Newspaper report 
only) 
March 2002 02/098 
Two divers were at a depth of 36m when the regulator of one of 
the pair began to free flow.  He switched to his buddy's 
alternative air source and they ascended to 20m.  From here he 
made a buoyant ascent to the surface.  The diver was placed 
on oxygen.  No ill effects were reported. 
March 2002 02/252 
Divers made a dive to a maximum depth of 35m.  Underwater 
visibility was poor.  During the ascent they deployed a delayed 
SMB.  At a depth of 13m one of the divers was unable to control 
his buoyancy and he made a rapid ascent to the surface, 
missing decompression stops.  He was using a new pony 
cylinder and this was his first sea dive of the year.  He believes 
that his buoyancy adjustment may have been wrong and that 
difficulty with an SMB reel may have distracted him.  He was 
placed on oxygen but experienced no subsequent ill effects. 
March 2002 02/311 
Ambulance called for two divers who had carried out a rapid 
ascent from 20m.  No medical treatment administered.  
(Coastguard report). 
March 2002 02/310 
Medical advice obtained for two divers who had effected a rapid 
ascent from 20m.  Although displaying no DCI symptoms, 
oxygen was administered and divers transported to local 
hospital for monitoring.  (Coastguard report). 
April 2002 02/105 
A diver completed a dive to a maximum depth of 16m.  At 10m 
she deployed a delayed SMB using an octopus regulator.  This 
regulator was snagged by the SMB and the diver was dragged 
rapidly to the surface.  She was given fluids and placed on 
oxygen.  No subsequent ill effects were reported.

April 2002 02/111 
A diver was observing two other divers who were involved in a 
training drill, ascending from 15 to 6m.  The two divers lost 
control of their buoyancy and they made a fast ascent.  The 
watching diver ascended even faster as he tried to keep up with 
them.  He was placed on oxygen for 15 min as a precaution.  
No subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
April 2002 02/128 
Two divers conducted a 31 min dive to a maximum depth of 
36m.  They were unable to locate the shotline to ascend so they 
deployed a delayed SMB.  They ascended to the surface 
missing decompression stops.  No subsequent ill effects were 
experienced. 
April 2002 02/135 
Two divers conducted a wreck dive to a depth of 33m.  One of 
the divers began to run low on air during the ascent.  They 
started to air share and whilst doing this the other diver became 
entangled in the shotline.  They sank back down to 18m as they 
tried to free the entangled diver.  They ascended again and 
conducted safety stops of 1 min at 6 m and 1 min at 3m.  They 
finally surfaced safely. 
April 2002 02/117 
A trainee and an instructor were conducting regulator removal 
skills at a depth of 6m.  The trainee panicked and made a fast 
ascent to the surface.  She suffered no subsequent ill effects. 
May 2002 02/140 
A diver was 11 min into a dive at a depth of 27m.  He noticed 
that his regulator was hard to breathe from for two breaths and 
then it failed to supply any air.  He reached for his autoair 
regulator but this gave him a mouthful of water.  He then used 
his pony regulator, from which he got air.  He was panicked and 
made a rapid ascent to the surface.  He was not able to inflate 
his BCD or his drysuit.  This ascent was completed in 1 min.  At 
the surface he shouted for help and was recovered into a boat.  
His buddy made a normal ascent when he realized that they 
had become separated.  The panicked diver was placed on 
oxygen.  He was later taken to hospital for a check up.  He was 
given more oxygen.  The diver experienced no ill effects.  No 
fault was found with his regulator. 
May 2002 02/151 
A trainee and an instructor were at a depth of 7m.  They were 
conducting regulator exchange drills when the trainee panicked 
and swam for the surface.  The instructor controlled the ascent.  
She was given oxygen as a precaution and no subsequent ill 
effects were reported. 
May 2002 02/137 
A trainee on his second open water dive was at 6m conducting 
regulator removal drills.  He put the regulator in upside down 
then struggled to get it the correct way up.  He swam rapidly for 
the surface.  He was in an extremely distressed condition and 
was taken by ambulance to hospital as a precaution.  He was 
released later that day. 
May 2002 02/144 
An instructor and two trainees made a dive to 21m.  At the end 
of the dive they planned to do a training drill using an alternative 
air source.  The instructor noted that one of the trainees was 
low on air and signaled the ascent without doing the drill.  
Shortly after the trainee who was low on air gave the 'out of air' 
signal.  The instructor was uncertain if the trainee really was out 
of air.  She passed him her alternative air source which he 
initially took.  He then began to panic, apparently unable to 
breathe from this regulator.  He started to fin for the surface.  
The instructor went with him trying to supply air.  At 8m she let 
go of the trainee who continued to the surface.  The other 
trainee was very buoyant and he too made a rapid ascent to the 
surface.  All were safely recovered from the water and the first 
trainee was given oxygen.  No subsequent ill effects were 
experienced. 
May 2002 02/196 
Two divers completed a dive to a maximum depth of 23m.  
They prepared a delayed SMB, and whilst doing so one of the 
pair became inverted.  The air in his drysuit moved into his legs 
and he started to ascend.  His buddy tried to stop him but both 
rose rapidly to 13m where the buddy let go.  The buoyant diver 
was carried to the surface.  The air forced his fins off and he 
was unable to right himself.  He was quickly recovered into the 
boat and he was placed on oxygen.  His computer which had 
shown 5 min of no stop time at the bottom showed a 5 min 
missed stop at the surface.  The diver breathed oxygen for 1 
hour and then nitrox 65 for another hour.  He was monitored for 
symptoms of DCI but none were seen and no further action was 
taken. 
June 2002 02/152 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 31m.  As 
they reached the end of their no stop time they prepared to 
deploy a delayed SMB to make their ascent.  The SMB reel 
jammed with 3 to 4m of line released and the diver released her 
hold on it.  There was a slight current and the line became 
entangled with her pillar valve and she was dragged upwards.  
She managed to free herself and achieve neutral buoyancy at 
18m.  She switched to her nitrox 50 decompression gas.  She 
saw her buddy's bubbles and swam over to rejoin him as he 
ascended.  The buddy had deployed his delayed SMB.  They 
conducted a 1 min stop at 18m, 2 min at 15m and a 
precautionary 10 min decompression stop at 6m. Their total 
dive time was 29 min.  They surfaced safely and no subsequent 
ill effects were experienced. 
June 2002 02/155 
An instructor and a trainee made a dive to 6m.  The trainee lost 
control of her buoyancy and rose to the surface.  They re-
descended and then the trainee's mask flooded.  She made a 
very rapid ascent to the surface.  She was very shaken and was 
placed on oxygen.  No subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
June 2002 02/166 
A diver completed a 10 min dive to a depth of 35m.  He 
deployed a delayed SMB to make his ascent.  The SMB line 
caught around his regulator hose and dragged him upwards.  
The regulator was pulled from his mouth and the diver struggled 
to recover it.  He was unable to prevent a rapid ascent directly 
to the surface.  He was recovered into his boat and placed on 
oxygen.  The Coastguard was alerted and the dive boat 
returned to the shore.  The diver showed no symptoms of DCI 
but was taken to a recompression facility for a check up.  He 
was not recompressed. 
June 2002 02/172 
A group of three divers made a dive to 21m for a duration of 40 
min.  As they prepared to ascend the weightbelt of one of the 
group became undone and fell away.  Her buddies were unable 
to prevent her from making a rapid, buoyant ascent to the 
surface.  Oxygen was obtained from an accompanying boat and 
given to the diver.  Oxygen was administered for 90 min and the 
diver was monitored for symptoms of DCI.  No symptoms were 
experienced and no further action was taken.

June 2002 02/158 
Two divers made a dive to 7m.  They became separated and 
surfaced.  They re-grouped and continued the dive.  They 
became separated a second time and one of the pair made a 
panic ascent to the surface.  She had no apparent injury but 
was given oxygen as a precaution. 
June 2002 02/345 
After becoming separated from buddy on trimix dive to 57 m, 
diver made a rapid ascent from 30m, missing stops.  Showed 
no symptoms of DCI, but put on oxygen and transferred to 
hyperbaric unit.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2002 02/347 
Diver maked rapid ascent from 12m following a 49 min dive to 
that depth.  Taken by ambulance to Poole Hospital for medical 
checks.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2002 02/348 
Following a dive to 36m, diver surfaced with computer locked 
into SOS mode and tingling in hand.  Medical advice taken and 
casualty transferred to local hospital for examination.  
Discharged shortly afterwards.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2002 02/199 
A diver was conducting regulator exchange drills at a depth of 
7m.  The diver panicked and made a rapid ascent to the 
surface.  A nearby diver came to assist and she was helped into 
a boat.  She was given oxygen.  No subsequent ill effects. 
June 2002 02/148 
Two divers made a dive to 21m.  One of the divers used his 
drysuit to adjust his buoyancy.  The inflator button stuck in and 
then fell apart.  The diver made a very rapid ascent to the 
surface from 16m.  He lost his fins and was left at the surface 
unable to help himself.  A rescue boat came to his assistance 
and he was recovered from the water.  He was placed on 
oxygen and suffered no apparent ill effects. 
June 2002 02/349 
Diver lost weightbelt at 20m, made a rapid ascent, placed on 
oxygen, no action taken, no resources used.  (Coastguard 
report). 
June 2002 02/174 
Two divers had completed a dive to a depth of 20m.  They 
prepared a delayed SMB and one of the pair used his 
alternative air source to inflate it.  This regulator went into free 
flow and the DSBM was released.  They could not stop the free 
flow and the other diver offered his alternative air source for use 
during the ascent.  The diver giving air took hold of the diver 
with the free flowing regulator but in doing so he unknowingly 
prevented this diver from reaching the dump valve on his 
drysuit.  This was not an auto dump.  Bubbles from the free 
flowing regulator confused the divers who rose to the surface 
from 20m in just over 1 min.   Both divers were recovered into 
their boat and were placed on oxygen.  No symptoms of DCI 
were experienced and no further action was taken. 
June 2002 02/179 
Two divers made a dive to a maximum depth of 20m.  At 15m 
one of the pair lost control of their buoyancy and made a rapid 
ascent to the surface.  No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
June 2002 02/183 
Two divers were at a depth of 21m.  One of the pair was using a 
hired drysuit and she experienced a problem with her fin.  She 
lost control of her buoyancy and made a rapid ascent from 17m 
to the surface.  No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
July 2002 02/243 
A diver lost control of his buoyancy whilst ascending from a 
maximum depth of 20m.  He made an uncontrolled ascent from 
10m to the surface.  The diver was laid down, given fluids and 
oxygen.  The Coastguard was alerted and the boat returned to 
the shore.  The boat was met by an ambulance and the diver 
was examined by the paramedics.  He was later released 
without symptoms.  It is thought that his drysuit dump valve was 
blocked by his undersuit. 
July 2002 02/184 
Whilst kitting up, a diver noticed some sand inside the 
connector of her suit inflation hose.  She cleaned it off, and then 
fitted and checked the valve.  She then dived, descended down 
a sloping wreck from 5 to 17m.  During the descent she used 
the valve to adjust the air in her drysuit.  As she started the 
return swim she started to become buoyant and could hear air 
hissing.  She tried to fin down to the wreck.  She disconnected 
the feed hose from her suit but could not dump air as she was 
head down.  She twisted to dump air from her cuff and tried to 
use her neck seal to dump air.  She was unable to prevent an 
uncontrolled ascent to the surface.  She was recovered into the 
boat and placed on oxygen.  The boat returned to shore and the 
emergency services were alerted.  She felt sick and unsteady 
but she had no symptoms of DCI.  She was taken to a 
recompression facility but no operator was available.  She was 
then taken to hospital from where she was later discharged.

Diver made a rapid ascent from 25m after a 25 min dive.  Lost 
buoyancy control due to drysuit not venting sufficiently.  No 
symptoms, placed under observation by paramedic.  
(Coastguard report). 
July 2002 02/188 
Two divers dived to 30m.  One of the pair suffered nitrogen 
narcosis and then made a rapid ascent to the surface.  Total 
dive duration 6 min.  No subsequent ill effects were 
experienced. 
July 2002 02/189 
A diver using a rebreather made a dive to a maximum depth of 
23m.  She and her buddy began to deploy a delayed SMB but 
discovered that the small inflator cylinder was empty.  The 
rebreather diver lent forward and used her autoair alternative air 
source to inflate the SMB.  As she did so she felt as if the right-
hand side lung of the rebreather had become loose.  This was 
checked and found to be normal.  She still felt buoyant so she 
emptied air from her drysuit and excess air from the counter 
lung.  They made a fast ascent to the surface.  During the 
ascent the diver changed the set point of the rebreather from 
1.3 to 0.7 and got ready to inflate her BCD in case she had a 
problem at the surface.  The divers were safely recovered into 
their boat.  The diver subsequently concluded that she must 
have accidentally inflated her BCD whilst trying to use the 
autoair to fill the SMB. 
July 2002 02/190 
Five divers made a dive to 35m.  One of the group experienced 
a free flow of his regulator and his alternative air source.  He 
made a rapid, free ascent to the surface.  His total dive duration 

NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2002

was 6 min.  No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
July 2002 02/222 
A diver made a descent to 35m.  At the bottom she let some air 
into her BCD.  Shortly afterwards she became aware that she 
was coming increasingly buoyant.  She discovered that the 
valve to her BCD had jammed and was continuing to let air in.  
She disconnected the hose, but was not able to dump air fast 
enough to prevent a buoyant ascent to the surface.  She 
breathed out during the ascent.  No subsequent ill effects were 
experienced. 
August 2002 02/247 
A diver entered the water from a boat.  In doing so he lost his 
face mask.  He swam back to the boat for a second mask whilst 
his buddy waited at the top of the shotline.  He used air during 
this swim and dived with 150 bar instead of the 220 bar that he 
started with.  As he descended the mask began to fog.  At the 
bottom his mask was badly fogged and he found it very difficult 
to see.  By flooding the mask he was able to see briefly.  He 
had 90 bar and his buddy had 140 bar.  With his buddy's 
assistance he deployed a delayed SMB.  He was becoming 
nervous and starting to hyperventilate.  The divers ascended at 
a fast rate to the surface.  They missed 6 min of decompression 
stops.  Back on the boat both divers were placed on oxygen.  
The panicked diver's contents gauge read 0 bar.  No 
subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
August 2002 02/394 
Dive RHIB 'Nocando' reported that one of their divers had made 
a rapid ascent from 15m after his regulator had become 
tangled.  Second dive of the day.  Diver was re-submerged and 
completed missed stops at 9, 6, 3m. 1st dive 34m 50 min, 
surface interval 2.5 to 3 hours.  2nd dive 24m 15 min.  
(Coastguard report). 
August 2002 02/396 
Diver made a rapid ascent from 28m missing all stops, 
administered oxygen and airlifted to Queen Alexander hospital, 
buddy also evacuated as precaution.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2002 02/284 
Two divers dived to a depth of 14m.  They carried out buoyancy 
checks and then followed a cable to a wreck.  7 min into the 
dive they exchanged OK signals.  Shortly afterwards one of the 
divers lost a 6kg weight pouch from his weightbelt and was 
unable to prevent a buoyant ascent to the surface.  The other 
diver soon realized that his buddy was missing and, after a brief 
search, he too returned to the surface.  No subsequent ill 
effects were experienced. 
 
 
August 2002 02/272 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 35m.  
They were following a sloping seabed into shallower water.  
After 18 min in a depth of 25m they prepared a delayed SMB.  
One of the divers filled the SMB and in doing so became 
buoyant.  He could not release air through his cuff dump as it 
had risen to his back and legs.  He held on to a rock but was 
unable to right himself even with his buddy's help.  He let go of 
the rock and attempted to regain control during the ascent.  He 
failed to do so and was carried directly to the surface missing a 
1 min stop at 6m and an 8 min stop at 3m.  His buddy followed 
him up.  The diver was recovered into the boat and placed on 
oxygen.  No symptoms were experienced and he dived again 
the following day. 
August 2002 02/241 
Two divers were taken by helicopter to a recompression facility 
after they had surfaced too quickly.  They showed no symptoms 
of DCI and were released without treatment.  (Newspaper 
report only). 
August 2002 02/408 
Diver surfaced from a  30m dive missing 11min of stops.  
(Coastguard report). 
September 2002 02/275 
Two divers completed a 35 min dive.  Near the end of the dive 
they spotted a lobster and stayed longer than intended to 
capture it.  One of the divers had less than 50 bar.  During the 
ascent they deployed a delayed SMB.  The diver who was low 
on air changed over to his pony cylinder and in doing so lost 
control of his buoyancy.  He ascended to the surface and then 
dived down to rejoin his buddy.  He then became concerned 
about the amount of air that he had left and surfaced.  He had 
no contents gauge on his pony cylinder.  His computer 
indicated that he had missed 7 min of decompression stops.  
His buddy who was diving with nitrox 32 was within the limits of 
his computer.  They were recovered into their boat and the diver 
who had missed stops was placed on oxygen and then nitrox 32 
when the oxygen was used up.  No adverse effects were 
experienced by either diver. 
September 2002 02/278 
A diver was a few minutes into a dive at a depth of 20m when 
he began to panic and signal that he wanted to ascend.  
Another diver helped him to the surface.  The diver was very 
distress and he was placed on oxygen.  He complained that his 
left leg and arm felt heavy and that he could not lift them.  He 
was taken by ambulance to hospital but it is not thought that he 
was recompressed. 
September 2002 02/432 
Dive boat reports two divers surfaced missing 35 min of stops, 
third diver with chemical burns from object picked up on the 
seabed.  Medi link established, all divers airlifted to hyperbaric 
chamber and burns unit.  (Coastguard report).

November 2001 02/039 
A pair of divers were at a depth of 18m.  One of the pair 
attempted to put air into his BCD but experienced difficulty in 
doing so.  He finned to the surface in a panic.  Total dive 
duration 18 min.  The BCD was hired.  No subsequent ill effects 
were experienced. 
November 2001 02/042 
Two divers conducted a shore dive to a depth of 18m.  They 
made a navigational error and one of the pair became short of 
air.  They surfaced using the alternative air source of the other 
diver.  At the surface they attempted to swim back to the shore 
but became exhausted.  The tide turned against them and they 
held onto rocks on a headland.  Their shore party alerted the 
Coastguard and a helicopter and a lifeboat were launched.  The 
divers were found and rescued from the shore. 
February 2002 02/076 
Three divers made a dive to 20m.  One of the pair was using an 
SMB for the first time.  This diver became tangled in the buoy 
line and the line became tangled with wreckage.  Her mask kept 
flooding and she decided to abort the dive.  Initially the line 
prevented her from ascending but she managed to get free and 
made a fast, buoyant ascent to the surface.  Her dive duration 
was 20 min.  No subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
March 2002 02/081 
A pair of divers were at an approximate depth of 15m.  One of 
the pair began to panic, spat out her regulator, inhaled some 
water and stirred up silt on the bottom.  Her buddy was unable to 
release his alternative air source nor the weights from the 
panicked diver's integrated weight system.  He used his suit and 
BCD to bring them both to the surface.  At the surface he 
shouted for help.  The casualty was recovered into a boat and 
brought to the shore.  She was given oxygen and taken by 
ambulance to hospital.  She was released 24 hours later. 
March 2002 02/307 
999 call reporting one a diving party of three had not surface.  
Helicopter tasked.  Overdue diver surfaced 4 min later.  All divers 
had been executing a circular dive, with 2 going one way and the 
third going the other (diving alone!!!)  - intending to meet up at 
the end.   The overdue diver got separated from the others due 
to very bad visibility at 30m and had completed extra 
recompression stops as a precautionary measure.  (Coastguard 
report). 
March 2002 02/099 
A diver rolled off the side of a hardboat to enter the water.  In the 
process her face mask struck one of the rungs of the boat's 
ladder.  The mask protected her from injury. 
March 2002 02/308 
Diving buddies reached surface but realized they had misread 
computers and missed 16 min of decompression stops.  Another 
diver made same mistake and missed 11 min of stops.  All 
divers transferred to hospital as a precaution.  (Coastguard 
report). 
March 2002 02/255 
Two divers dived to a maximum depth of 22m.  After about 30 
min they deployed a delayed SMB.  The dive leader attached the 
reel to a rock and filled the buoy.  The line became tangled and 
took some time to sort out.  She then clipped the reel onto her 
buddy.  The buddy had not used a reel before.  Both divers had 
dumped air from their buoyancy devices before deploying the 
SMB.  The buddy was now low on air.  He struggled to control 
his buoyancy and the reel.  At about 10m his regulator was hard 
to breathe from.  He signaled that he was out of air, but he was 
slightly above the other diver and the signal was not understood.  
He then took her alternative air source and dropped the reel.  
The buddy took the reel and they made a controlled ascent.  
They had to pause at 6m to clear away another line that was 
obstructing their ascent.  Both surfaced safely. 
April 2002 02/118 
A trainee and an instructor commenced a dive.  The trainee had 
a problem with her mask and they surfaced to resolve this.  They 
dived to the top of a wreck at a depth of 14m.  They then 
descended down an anchor chain to the bottom.  The trainee 
started to panic.  The instructor brought her to the surface; their 
ascent was faster than normal.  The instructor's computer 
indicated missed decompression but he had no symptoms of 
DCI.  The trainee was unwell and was placed on oxygen.  She 
was taken by ambulance to hospital where she was kept until 
late that evening for observation. 
May 2002 02/120 
Three divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 11m.  
When the dive leader noticed that the other two had about 50 bar 
remaining he led the way to shallower water to make an ascent.  
The regulator of one of the other divers was kicked from his 
mouth.  He attracted the attention of the other diver who offered 
him his alternative air source.  He did not take the regulator so 
the other diver pushed it into his mouth and brought him to the 
surface using a controlled buoyant lift.  The instructor followed. 
May 2002 02/130 
Three divers entered the water via a harbour slipway.  They 
planned to swim underwater to a buoy just outside the harbour 
entrance and then return.  The divers swam outside the harbour 
and headed away.  They surfaced, gave the OK signal to the 
shore party, and then they dived again.  They continued to swim 
away from the harbour.  The dive marshal on shore became 
concerned and contacted the local harbour control room.  A 
police launch was tasked to assist.  The divers surfaced and 
dived again.  This time they made their way to some rocks.  They 
finally surfaced and were escorted on their swim back by the 
police launch.  All three were unharmed. 
May 2002 02/258 
Two divers made a dive to a maximum depth of 20m.  A few 
minutes into the dive one of the pair felt that there was a problem 
with her regulator, she started to panic and to swim for the 
surface.  Her buddy held on to her and repeatedly offered her 
alternative air source.  The panicked diver rejected this and 
struggled to the surface.  At the surface she quickly recovered.  
Her buddy towed her to the shore and she was assisted from the 
water.  No subsequent ill effects were experienced by either 
diver.  No problem was found with the regulator. 
June 2002 02/157 
An instructor and a trainee made a dive to 6m.  After 10 min the 
trainee signaled that he wanted to go up.  His mask was flooded.  
The instructor returned the signal but the trainee did not

respond.  The instructor helped the trainee to the surface using a 
controlled buoyant lift.  The trainee had previously experienced 
problems with mask clearing. 
June 2002 02/259 
A diver was descending a shotline to a wreck.  During the 
descent he let go of the line to clear his mask and to dump air 
from his BCD.  Whilst doing so he lost contact with the shotline 
and became separated from his buddies.  The buddies surfaced.  
The lone diver continued to the seabed at a depth of 27m.  At the 
bottom he attempted to locate the others by using his torch.  He 
then heard the boat's engines being revved up.  He understood 
this to be a signal to surface, which he did.  All divers were safely 
recovered. 
June 2002 02/200 
A pair of divers prepared to enter the water.  One went ahead 
and was below the surface before the second diver entered.  The 
second diver expected his buddy to swim underwater to the 
shotline, which he thought would take them to a wreck at 20m.  
The second diver entered the water and followed his buddy.  
They did not find the shotline and at 25m the second diver had 
not caught up.  At 30m the second diver was breathing very hard 
and his pulse was rising.  They reached the seabed at a depth of 
38m.  The second diver was breathing very rapidly and his pulse 
rate was very high.  He signaled that they should abort the dive 
and they started to ascend.  They quickly got to 20m, at 14m 
their computers indicated no stops and they came straight to the 
surface.  On the surface the second diver was hyperventilating 
and once back in the boat he breathed nitrox 50.  After 15 min he 
had recovered.  His computer indicated a fast ascent.  He dived 
again later that day. 
July 2002 02/251 
Two divers made a dive to 32m.  Prior to the dive one of the pair 
noticed that her regulator was hissing slightly and she decided to 
check her air more often during the dive.  22 min into the dive 
with 5 min of decompression indicated this diver had 90 bar 
remaining.  They decided to ascend.  The other diver then 
realized that his SMB reel had unwound around them and this 
took some time to resolve.  The diver who was low on air then 
deployed her SMB and they began to ascend.  During the ascent 
she passed the reel to her buddy as she was getting tired and 
breathless.  At 6m she checked her air and found that she only 
had 20 bar remaining.  She showed her buddy and he prepared 
his alternative air source.  She was breathing heavily and the 
alternative air source did not supply enough air.  She switched 
back to her own regulator.  The buddy switched to his pony 
regulator.  The breathless diver then switched back to the 
buddy's alternative air source but part of the regulator had fallen 
away and it would no longer work.  She used his main regulator.  
By this time the buddy's computer had cleared.  During this 
period the buddy unknowingly released the brake on the SMB 
reel and they dropped down to 9m.  They re-ascended.  The 
buddy decided to swap back to his main regulator and give the 
pony regulator to the diver who was out of air.  She took a few 
breaths from this regulator and it then ran out; her computer 
showed 5 min decompression required.  They decided to surface 
sharing the one remaining regulator.  Both divers were monitored 
but no ill effects were experienced. 
August 2002 02/270 
Two divers entered a wreck in a depth of 39m.  They found their 
way blocked and turned around.  Whilst doing so the regulator of 
one of the divers began to free flow.  The visibility went to zero 
and the diver with the free flow panicked.  The divers became 
separated.  Both managed to find their way out of the wreck and 
both deployed delayed SMBs and made, separate, safe ascents 
to the surface. 
August 2002 02/235 
Two divers were swimming on the surface at the start of their 
dive.  One of the pair, who was wearing a membrane drysuit, had 
difficulty with her buoyancy and started to sink.  She panicked 
and a boat came to her aid.  Both divers were safely recovered 
from the water. 
August 2002 02/293 
Two rebreather divers descended their shotline to a wreck in a 
depth of 33m.  Shortly into the dive another shotweight and line 
landed less than 2m away from them.  They continued their dive, 
sheltering in the overhangs.  On surfacing they asked the skipper 
of the other boat why he had dropped another shot, close to their 
own and whilst they were in the water.  He had not considered 
the presence of rebreather divers and, seeing no bubbles, 
assumed it was safe.  Their own cox had tried unsuccessfully to 
attract the attention of the other skipper to warn him. 
August 2002 02/294 
A rebreather diver and an open circuit air diver were diving on a 
wreck in a depth of 30m.  Whilst they were down another dive 
boat arrived and threw in a shotline without checking that all was 
clear.  Later, when these divers were carrying out 
decompression stops at 5m a dive RHIB ran over their shot 
buoy.  Neither diver was hurt in these incidents. 
September 2002 02/279 
A diver ran out of air at a depth of 20m.  Her buddy assisted her 
with an alternative air source.  They made a faster than normal 
ascent to the surface.  No subsequent ill effects were 
experienced.

October 2001 02/056 
Two divers dived to a maximum depth of 20m.  10 min into the 
dive, at a depth of 18m, the feed hose to the BCD of one of the 
divers burst, with a loud bang, close to the second stage.  The 
other diver made his alternative air source ready.  The air 
supply of the first diver was rapidly depleted and he made a fast 
ascent to the surface.  The buddy followed at a slower pace.  At 
the surface he gave the emergency signal and two boats 
involved with the group recovered the divers.  No subsequent ill 
effects were experienced. 
November 2001 02/040 
A direct feed hose in use in a swimming pool was thought to be 
leaking.  A person on the pool side connected the hose to a 
cylinder to check it.  Part of the direct feed valve was then 
suddenly blown out of the valve body.  This component hit the 
person's hand and then his face.  It was found that this 
component had been incorrectly assembled. 
January 2002 02/033 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 33m.  At 20m 
his regulator began to free flow and he sank back down to 31m.  
It is thought that he then suffered narcosis.  He made a faster 
than normal ascent to the surface.  No subsequent ill effects 
were experienced. 
January 2002 02/035 
A diver was at a depth of 35m when his regulator began to free 
flow.  He aborted the dive.  His total dive time was 8 min.  No 
subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
February 2002 02/074 
Two divers conducted a dive to 35m.  The regulator of one of 
the pair began to free flow.  He made a fast ascent to the 
surface.  Total dive time 8 min.  No subsequent ill effects were 
reported. 
February 2002 02/063 
Two divers dived to a maximum depth of 8m.  One of the pair 
experienced a regulator free flow.  He tried to take his buddy's 
alternative air source but his hood rose up to cover his mouth.  
He panicked and made a fast ascent to the surface.  Other 
divers assisted them from the water and the diver was placed 
on oxygen.  No subsequent ill effect was reported. 
February 2002 02/077 
Two divers made a dive to 20m.  17 min into the dive both 
regulators of one of the divers began to free flow.  The other 
diver offered his alternative air source and they made a fast 
ascent to the surface.  No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
February 2002 02/089 
Three divers began a dive to a depth of 24m.  At 18m the 
regulator of one of the group began to free flow.  The regulator 
was free flowing so violently that he could hardly keep it in his 
mouth.  He switched to his pony regulator and in doing so they 
dropped down to 24m.  His pony regulator then began to free 
flow.  He made an ascent to the surface.  During the ascent he 
lost contact with the other two divers due to the bubbles.  They 
surfaced 1 min later.  The water temperature was 4 deg. C.  
The main regulator had a history of free flow following a service 
and was returned to the manufacturer.  The manufacturer did 
not identify any problem. 
July 2002 02/187 
Two divers completed a dive and were conducting a surface 
swim to leave the water.  The BCD of one of the pair began to 
leak badly.  The BCD would not hold air and the diver struggled 
to stay at the surface.  They were picked up by boat.  No 
subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
July 2002 02/268 
Two divers completed a 20 min dive to a maximum depth of 
32m.  They ascended the shotline to where they planned to 
carry out a practice decompression stop.  Two cylinders and 
regulators had been lowered to the 6m stop but when the divers 
got there they found only one.  The other cylinder had been 
quickly attached with two cable ties and these are thought to 
have been broken by the water movement resulting in the loss 
of the cylinder and regulator.  The divers completed their dive 
safely. 
July 2002 02/264 
Two pairs of divers made a dive to a maximum depth of 35m 
using trimix 30/30.  After 40 min one diver of one of the pairs 
deployed a delayed SMB and they started their ascent.  At 21m 
they stopped.  At this point the other diver of the pair also 
deployed a delayed SMB and they both switched to nitrox 50.  
When one of the divers turned on his decompression cylinder 
bubbles started pouring from the first stage.  He was not able to 
resolve this problem.  He turned this cylinder off again and they 
ascended to 18m.  They spent 4 min at 18m and 5 min at 15m.  
They ascended to 12m and each breathed for 1 min from the 
buddy's nitrox 50 cylinder.  They then ascended to 9m and each 
breathed for 4 min from the nitrox cylinder.  They ascended to 
6m where they commenced buddy breathing from the nitrox 
cylinder.  The other pair of divers arrived at the same point and 
the diver without decompression gas buddy-breathed with one 
of the others to even out the gas consumption.  They extended 
their planned 15 min stop at 6m by a few minutes and then 
surfaced.  No subsequent ill effects were experienced.  An 'O' 
ring was found to have blown out of the high pressure port of 
the leaking first stage. 
August 2002 02/228 
Two divers were at a depth of 21m.  One of the pair 
experienced difficulty in keeping water out of her mask.  She 
inhaled some of this water and became distressed.  Her buddy 
brought her to the surface using a controlled buoyant lift.  At the 
surface she was in a panic and the buddy towed her to the 
shore.  No subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
August 2002 02/227 
Two divers were at a depth of 21m.  One of the pair got water in 
her regulator.  This caused her distress and she started to use 
her buddy's alternative air source.  They made a fast ascent to 
6m where they then remained for 15 min.  No subsequent ill 
effects were reported.

Miscellaneous 
 
 
October 2001 02/436 
Lifeboat launched to assist dive boat.  False alarm.  (RNLI 
report). 
February 2002 02/445 
Lifeboat launched to search for missing diver(s).  Probably a 
hoax.  (RNLI report). 
March 2002 02/446 
Lifeboat launched to search for diver(s) swept away.  False 
alarm.  (RNLI report). 
March 2002 02/250 
Three divers descended to 20m for a drift dive.  At the bottom 
one of the divers indicated that he was not happy.  The dive 
leader attempted to establish what the problem was but got no 
reply.  The dive leader brought the troubled diver back to the 
surface using a controlled buoyant lift.  The other diver kept with 
them.  They were recovered into their boat.  The underwater 
visibility had been very low and the diver had felt as if he was 
spinning during the descent.  No subsequent ill effects were 
experienced. 
March 2002 02/110 
Two divers completed a dive to 20m for 31 min.  5 hours 18 min 
later, they dived again.  They descended to a depth of 19m.  The 
site was uninteresting so they came back up a slope to 13m.  At 
this point one of the divers coughed, broke the seal on his 
regulator, and ingested seawater, causing him distress.  His 
buddy brought him to the surface using a controlled buoyant lift.  
The last part of the ascent was quicker than normal.  No 
subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
April 2002 02/449

Lifeboat launched to assist diver(s).  False alarm.  (RNLI report). 
June 2002 02/474 
Two instructors and two students were preparing three RHIBs for 
practical sessions during a boat handling course.  As one pair 
were securing one of the boats alongside a jetty a man on a 
nearby yacht called to them for assistance.  They went to 
investigate and found the man to be grey, cold and clammy and 
complaining of chest pains.  The instructor stayed with the 
casualty and sent the student to get assistance.  The other 
instructor and student then arrived.  The student was a qualified 
nurse and believed that the casualty was suffering a cardiac 
arrest.  They laid the casualty down and administered oxygen.  
They moved the yacht to a better position for access by the 
ambulance crew.  When the ambulance arrived a defibrillator 
was used three times before a pulse was re-established.  The 
casualty was taken to hospital and the divers secured the yacht.  
The casualty was reported to be recovering well.

Fatalities 
 
February 2002 02/085 
Two pairs of divers and a guide entered the water to begin a 
dive.  One pair began their descent and the guide descended 
with one diver of the other pair.  The fourth diver was seen to be 
in trouble at the surface and the first pair re-ascended to assist.  
The diver was struggling, her mask was filled with blood and 
vomit and she had no regulator in her mouth.  She began to 
make a rapid descent and one of the first pair took hold of her, 
replaced her regulator and pressed the purge; no air came out.  
He reached for her cylinder valve and found it was turned off.  
He turned it on.  The casualty was not able to keep the 
regulator in her mouth.  The rescuing diver held the regulator in 
place and brought her to the surface.  At the surface he towed 
the casualty to the boat and after some misunderstanding the 
casualty was lifted out of the water.  The other divers were 
recovered and the boat set off for shore.  The casualty's 
breathing was laboured and she was vomiting.  The casualty 
was placed on oxygen.  When they reached the shore the 
casualty stopped breathing.  Resuscitation techniques were 
applied.  A nearby holidaymaker came to assist, stating that she 
was a doctor.  There was no local doctor at this location.  The 
assisting doctor took over the resuscitation but after a brief 
period stated that the casualty was dead.  There was doubt 
over whether this diver had been wearing a weightbelt. 
April 2002 02/094 
A diver undertook a solo dive.  He failed to surface at the 
planned time and 30 min later the alarm was raised.  An aircraft 
and other divers conducted a search until nightfall.  Police and 
others continued the search, unsuccessfully, for the next two 
days, at which point the diver was declared missing, presumed 
drowned. 
July 2002 02/225 
A diver had dived to a maximum depth of 42m.  He was 
unconscious at the surface.  Other divers assisted.  He was not 
breathing.  CPR and oxygen assisted AV were administered.  
The emergency services were called and arrived 45 min later.  
The diver was pronounced dead at the scene.  A heart attack 
was suspected. 
 
 
 
Decompression 
 
March 2002 02/084 
A diver completed his second dive of the day to a maximum 
depth of 14m for a duration of 51 min with a 3 min stop.  After 
his dive he felt a tingling in his fingers and 'pins and needles' 
spreading towards the bicep of his left arm.  The diver was laid 
down and given oxygen.  The emergency services were alerted 
and he was taken to hospital.  The diver continued to breathe 
oxygen and was given fluids.  No recompression facility was 
available at this site.  The diver was kept on oxygen over night.  
The following morning he was taken off of oxygen.  90 min later 
he again complained of a tingling feeling and was put back on 
oxygen.  Arrangements were made to evacuate the diver to 
another site.  This diver had experienced a DCI 5 years earlier. 
 
April 2002 02/315 
Following two dives and a rapid ascent, diver climbed a 
mountain and then did a further six dives (noticing symptoms of 
DCI improved on dive), then got progressively worse.  Was 
abroad at the time.  Flew home and required treatment at 
hyperbaric unit (24 hours).  (Coastguard report). 
 
 
 
Injury/Illness 
 
October 2001 02/017 
A group of divers descended to a wreck at 20m.  They swam 
past the wreck and dropped over a ledge to a depth of 33m.  
One of the group was left somewhat behind the others and he 
finned hard to catch up.  He became anxious and out of breath.  
His breathlessness increased to the point where he was unable 
to breathe properly and he made an uncontrolled ascent to the 
surface.  He showed no symptoms but was placed on oxygen 
for 15 min as a precaution.  He later found that he had 2 kg of 
unnecessary weight on his belt.  He suggested that narcosis 
may have played a part.  He was under stress from work related 
issues. 
November 2001 02/047 
Three divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 27m.  
They started their ascent up the side of a wreck.  At 16m one of 
the divers indicated that all was not well and lapsed into a 
semiconscious state.  One of the other divers lifted him to the 
surface with a controlled buoyant lift and summoned 
assistance.  The casualty was recovered into the boat and 
placed on oxygen.  Assistance was sought by radio and the 
casualty taken back to the shore.  From there he was taken to 
hospital by ambulance and released later that day.  No cause of 
the problem was identified. 
December 2001 02/071 
A diver had completed a 25 min dive to a maximum depth of 
30m.  He climbed a ladder to get back on the boat.  At the top 
of the ladder he caught one of his fins and fell flat onto his face.  
He sustained cuts to his nose and suffered a nose bleed.  He 
was able to dive again the following day. 
May 2002 02/139 
Five pairs of divers entered the water inside a reef.  Three pairs 
swam through a cut that led to the outside of the reef and were 
caught by a strong and unexpected current.  Two pairs were 
thrown on to the top of the reef by surf.  These divers received 
cuts, bruising and coral burns.  The other pair managed to get 
out beyond the surf line, where they surfaced and attempted to 
attract the attention of those in the boat.  The boat operator 
would not go through the cut as he considered that the 
conditions were too rough.  Another boat went through and 
recovered the divers.  All were safely returned to shore. 
June 2002 02/173 
A trainee diver carried out mask clearing drills at a depth of 2m.  
He then attempted to re-descend for further training but 
experienced difficulty in clearing his left ear.  Several attempts 
were made and he then experienced a severe pain in his ear.  
The dive was aborted and the diver sought medical advice.  A 
perforation of the right eardrum was found and inflammation of

the left ear.  He was given antibiotics.  The diver had previously 
suffered a perforated eardrum whilst water skiing. 
July 2002 02/204 
A diver dived to 20m for 29 min.  After a surface interval of 1 
hour she dived again with two others.  On reaching 18m she 
signaled that something was wrong.  She looked dizzy and 
lethargic.  One of the other divers took hold of her and brought 
her and the buddy to the surface.  During the ascent the 
casualty became worse and was losing consciousness.  She 
was recovered into the boat, laid down and placed on oxygen.  
The emergency services were alerted.  The diver showed no 
signs of DCI but appeared hypothermic and in shock.  She was 
covered and given water.  The air temperature was 30 deg C., 
the surface water temperature was 25 deg C, but at depth it 
was 21 deg C.  The casualty was of slim build and was only 
wearing a 3 mm shortie wetsuit.  Once ashore she was taken to 
hospital and released 2 hours later. 
July 2002 02/219 
A diver was diving on a wreck at a depth of 25m.  He cut the 
middle finger of his left hand on a jagged piece of wreckage.  
He returned to the shotline and made his ascent to the surface.  
The boat returned to shore and the casualty was taken to 
hospital where his finger required ten stitches. 
September 2002 02/276 
Two divers conducted a 25 min dive to 25m with a 2 min stop at 
6m.  After the dive they complained of headaches, nausea and 
'dry retching'.  Their skin was pale.  Carbon monoxide 
poisoning was suspected and both divers were placed on 
oxygen and taken to hospital.  Their diving cylinders and the 
compressors from which they were filled were quarantined for 
checks. 
 
 
 
Boating / Surface Incidents 
 
July 2002 02/218 
Divers had entered the water from two boats.  One boat waited 
at anchor and the other moved down tide.  The moving boat 
was caught by a large swell and the wind, and it overturned 
throwing two people into the water.  The other boat went to 
assist.  The upturned boat was towed to a mooring and floating 
diving equipment from this boat was recovered.  The upturned 
boat was righted.  The engine of the capsized boat was cleaned 
with fresh water and restarted.  The boats returned to shore and 
the lost equipment was identified.  Some of the divers later went 
back to the site and recovered much of the lost equipment. 
 
 
 
Ascents 
 
October 2001 02/015 
A trainee and an instructor were conducting a wreck dive to a 
maximum depth of 15m.  The instructor let go of the trainee's 
hand to deploy a delayed SMB.  The trainee then lost control of 
her buoyancy and made a rapid ascent to the surface.  Her dive 
duration was 12 min.  The instructor then realized that the 
trainee was missing and looked around for her.  He then made 
a normal ascent.  The trainee was placed on oxygen for 10 min.  
She exhibited no symptoms and the oxygen was stopped.  No 
subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
January 2002 02/070 
An instructor and two trainees dived down a shotline to a depth 
of 15m.  On the seabed they attached a distance line to the shot 
and swam a distance of about 30m.  At this point the instructor 
noticed one of the trainees 2m off the bottom and apparently 
struggling with his BCD dump control.  He passed the line to the 
other trainee and signaled him to wait.  He swam to the buoyant 
trainee and attempted to dump air from his BCD, but it was 
empty.  He located the trainee's drysuit dump and found it 
closed.  He opened this valve but was unable to prevent them 
from being carried to the surface.  At the surface the trainee 
was recovered into the boat.  The instructor swam to the 
shotline, descended and returned to the second trainee.  They 
surfaced together.  The buoyant diver complained of dizziness 
and nausea and was placed on oxygen.  Medical advice was 
sought and both buoyant diver and instructor were monitored 
for signs of DCI.  No subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
 
 
 
Technique 
 
March 2002 02/083 
A group of divers led by an instructor made a descent down a 
fixed line to a wreck.  They grouped up on the side of the wreck 
at 16m.  They explored the wreck and then stopped for a 
photograph.  At this point one of the divers started to ascend.  
The instructor followed her up.  At the surface the diver stated 
that she did not know how she had got to the surface.  She was 
recovered into the boat and placed on oxygen as a precaution.  
The instructor returned to the group and brought them back to 
the line to make a normal ascent.  The subject diver was given 
a medical check up but suffered no ill effects. 
June 2002 02/198 
A pair of divers were dropped into the water from their boat 
close to the shotline.  Divers from an earlier dive surfaced and 
were being picked up when a distress signal was given by the 
pair who had just been dropped off.  One of the pair felt over 
weighted and he was unable to reach his BCD inflator as it had 
become trapped behind his back.  The hose was freed but it did 
not fill his BCD quickly and he dropped his weights.  The boat 
finished recovering the divers who had surfaced and then went 
to assist the distressed diver.  The pair were recovered into the 
boat and the distressed diver was placed on oxygen.  He 
recovered after a short period.
