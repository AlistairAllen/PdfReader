 ` NDC Diving Incidents Report - 1999 
Introduction 
 
This booklet contains the 1999 Diving Incidents Report, produced by The British Sub-Aqua Club  (BSAC) in the 
interest of promoting diving safety.  It is important to note that it contains details of UK diving incidents occurring 
to divers of all affiliations, plus incidents occurring worldwide involving BSAC members.  
 
Report Format 
The majority of statistical information contained within this report is also shown in graphical form.  Please note that all 
statistical information is produced from UK data only and does not include Overseas Incidents unless noted as ‘All 
Incidents’. 
 
The contents of this report are split into an overview of the year, and then the details of nine incident categories plus some 
historical analyses.  The various sections can be found as shown below:- 
 
 i) Overview Page  1 
 ii) Fatalities Page  4 
 iii) Decompression Incidents Page  6 
 iv) Injury / illness Page  13 
 v) Boating & Surface Incidents Page  17 
 vi) Ascent Problems Page  23 
 vii) Technique Problems Page  26 
 viii) Equipment Problems Page  28 
 ix) Miscellaneous Incidents Page  30 
 x) Overseas Incidents Page  31 
 xi) Numerical & Statistical Analyses Page  34 
 xii) List of Abreviations Page  36 
 
 
Within each category the incidents are listed in the order of their occurrence, not necessarily that of Incident Reference.  
They are laid out in the following form: 
 
  MONTH/YR OF INCIDENT  INCIDENT REF.    
  Brief Narrative of Incident.................................................................................... 
  ........................................................................................................ 
 
The nature of many diving incidents is such that there is usually more than one cause or effect.  Where this is the case the 
incident has been classified under the more appropriate cause or effect. For instance an incident involving a fast ascent, 
causing decompression illness, will be classified under 'Decompression Incidents'.

NDC Diving Incidents Report - 1999                           
Overview 
 
has seen a fall in the total number of incidents 
that have been reported.  In the 1999 incident 
year (October 98 to September 99 inclusive) 382 
incidents have been recorded, compared with 431 in 1998 and 
370 in 1997.  Part of the reduction over last year will be due to 
the cancellation of the press cutting service for cost control 
reasons.  In the 1998 incident year, incidents recorded by press 
reports only accounted for 4% of the total.  If the same factor is 
applied to the 1999 data, a total of 398 reports might have been 
expected.  It is anticipated that the 2000 report will again 
incorporate press cutting information. 
1999 The report includes 17 UK fatalities of which 8 involved BSAC members.  17 Fatalities is in line with the average number of 
UK fatalities that have been experienced in the last five years 
(16.8) but  it is higher than the average of the last ten years 
(14.8), indicating a trend of increasing deaths.  Fatalities of 
BSAC membership is slightly higher than the averages of the 
past five and ten years, but there is no indication of an 
increasing trend.  Indeed, when the numbers of BSAC fatalities 
are compared with BSAC membership numbers over the last 
twenty years a strong trend of increasing safety can be seen.  
 
The distribution of these reports is shown in the following chart, 
which is entirely consistent with previous years.  As can be 
seen, 68% of these incidents have occurred in the summer 
period.  
The causal factors behind the UK fatalities can be summarised 
as follows:- 
• Three cases were the result of people experiencing heart 
attacks whilst diving. 
 • Three cases resulted from dives in the 50 to 60m depth 
range, one of which involved a solo diver using a 
rebreather.  The cause of this latter fatality is unclear, but 
the diver is known to have made a very rapid ascent with 
his drysuit over-inflated.

80 • A second case of a fatality of a diver using a rebreather 
occurred at the very beginning of a dive, with the diver 
becoming unconscious at the surface.  Again the exact 
cause is not known. 
• Two cases involved divers at or near the surface.   
In the first, two divers became separated from their boat 
and one of them lost conciousness in rough sea 
conditions.  Some time passed before they were rescued 
and the unconscious diver did not recover. 
In the second case a diver was struck on the head by a 
boat’s propeller and died from the injuries. 
 
This leaves eight cases remaining where there is simply 
insufficient information to draw any conclusions with respect to 
the causes.   
 
 • Four involved divers who were lost underwater and not 
recovered despite extensive searches; one in a lake and 
three at sea. 
Incidents by category 
The incident database categorises all incidents into one of nine 
major categories, and the following chart shows the distribution 
of the 1999 incidents into those categories.  
• Four others involved divers who became unconscious 
underwater and, despite being recovered at the time, 
failed to respond to resuscitation techniques.    
Categorisation of the year’s incidents   
In many of these cases it is clear that accepted safe diving 
practices were not being followed.

Incident depths 
The following chart  shows the maximum depth of the dive 
during which the incident took place, summarised into depth 
range groupings.  The pattern is very similar to that normally 
seen and reflects the frequency of diving in these depth ranges.  
There is an increase over last year of dives greater than 50m; 
twelve incidents with maximum depths of over 50m, compared 
to six last year.   
As noted earlier, three of these twelve incidents at depths of 
over 50m resulted in fatalities, this is a significantly higher 
fatality to incident ratio than is seen in the shallower depth 
ranges.  The potential for problems increases significantly as 
diving depth increases. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120
BSAC Safe Diving Practices advises that no dive should be 
deeper than 50m, and that dives to 50m should only be 
conducted by divers who are appropriately trained and qualified. 
This chart indicates 16 incidents involving fatalitites, but one of 
these was a double fatality.

The next chart shows the depth at which the incident started.  
Inevitably the data is biased towards the shallower depths since 
many incidents happen during the ascent or at the surface.  
Critical among these are the DCI cases where almost always 
the casualty is out of the water before any problems are noted.  
This partially explains the large occurrence of ‘surface’ cases as 
this includes divers with DCI who have left the water.

Other surface incidents involve boats and boating incidents.  
1999 has been a typical year for boating problems; 50 incidents 
involving engine failure, and 13 cases involving problems with 
the boat itself.  Numbers of divers becoming separated from 
their boats has increased, with 51 instances reported, 
compared with 34 last year.   
 
Inadequate maintainence is certain to be the cause of many of 
the engine problems.    
Engine failure, with divers underwater, often results in lost 
divers since the boat is no longer able to recover them.  These 
divers are then left floating at the surface until discovered.  The 
search operation is often very extensive with lifeboats, other 
craft and helicopters deployed to find the missing divers, and 
sometimes the divers are not found quickly.   
One of the cases in this report records a 7 hour search before 
the lost divers were found, and in another case a pair of divers 
were found just before nightfall. 
 
As in previous years, the benefits of effective surface detection 
aids are highlighted, especially in the Coastguard reports.

It is important to note that these divers were involved in the 
incident but this does not necessarily mean that they suffered 
the effects of it.  Some were involved as rescuers or in some 
other indirect way. 
 
An analysis of incident by diver qualification shows that no 
grade of diver, from novice to instructor, is immune to problems.  
It is all too easy to make the assumption that only inexperienced 
divers get into problems, but the chart shows that this is not so. 
Although it suggests that divers at the level of Sports Diver are 
the most prone to problems one must be careful in the 
interpretation of these data.  The picture is clearly distorted by 
the numbers of members that we have at each of these grades.  
It is very probable that the largest single group of members are 
Sports Divers, hence the high incidence of problems.   
 
The distribution of these qualification data conforms to the 
pattern seen in previous years. 
 
 
Divers’ use of the Emergency Services 
Divers’ use of the rescue services shows a monthly distribution 
aligned to the distribution of all incidents, and is clearly 
correlated with the number of dives that are taking place.  Our 
demands upon the Coastguard service was typical for the year, 
as were our calls upon the services of the RNLI.

Also very similar to last year has been divers’ need for 
assistance by helicopter.  There were two main reasons for this; 
firstly the transportion of divers with DCI to recompression 
facilities and, secondly, for the location of lost divers.

Decompression Incidents 
The BSAC database contains 86 reports of DCI incidents, some 
of which involve more than one casualty.  When these multiple 
cases are counted the result is 98 incidents of DCI. 
The 1998 report recorded a total of 120 incidents of DCI; it is to 
be hoped that this reduction marks the beginning of a new trend 
towards more careful diving.   
 
An analysis of the causal factors associated with these cases 
indicates the following:- 
31% involve diving to greater than 30m 
29% involve rapid ascents 
21% involve repeat diving 
14% involve missed decompression stops 
Some cases involve more than one of these causes. 
 
The report includes several cases of ‘Diver illness’ reported by 
the RNLI and whilst the nature of this illness is not recorded it is 
very likely that these are further cases of DCI. 
 
The 1999 data show that an increasing number of rapid ascents 
involve poor buoyancy control, and there seems to be two main 
reasons for this loss of control.  Firstly divers are simply failing 
to correctly maintain control over their drysuit and/or BCD, 
usually during the ascent.  Secondly, there have been a number 
of cases where divers have lost their weightbelts. 
The primary reason behind the buoyancy control issue appears 
to be training, or the lack of it; some divers are clearly not 
skilled enough to maintain the delicate balance required to 
prevent an uncontrolled ascent.  Other issues relate to the 
failure of inflation and/or dump valves, and here correct 
servicing and appropriate equipment configuration is the key.  
With respect to weightbelts, the report contains a number of 
examples of weightbelts being accidentally released.  Again the 
issues relate to servicing, configuration and experience. 
 
 
In Conclusion 
The 1999 incidents year has not highlighted any major new 
concerns.  Most of the incidents reported within this document 
could have been avoided had those involved followed a few 
basic principles of safe diving practice.  Those that I would 
emphasise are:- 
• Dive within your limits. 
• Build your experience gradually. 
• Practice the basic skills until you are faultless, and then 
keep in practice. 
• Plan and equip yourself correctly for the dive. 
• Maintain constant vigilance whilst involved in diving 
activities and be ready to act quickly as soon as things 
start to go astray.  
• Ensure that equipment is fully and correctly serviced (both 
diving and boating). 
 
Please read the detailed reports in this booklet carefully and 
use them to learn from others’ mistakes. They have had the 
courage and generosity to record their experiences for 
publication, the least that we can do is to use this information to 
avoid similar problems. 
 
Finally, if you must have an incident please report it on our 
Incident Report form, available free from BSAC HQ or via the 
BSAC internet website.   
As always, your anonymity is assured – great care is taken to 
preserve the confidentiality of any personal information 
recorded in BSAC Incident Reports.

May 1999 99/094 
Two divers were ascending from a wreck dive.  At 14m one of 
the divers attracted the attention of his buddy and then 
collapsed releasing his mouthpiece.  The buddy brought him to 
the surface, started resuscitation and summoned help.  The 
casualty was recovered into the boat, the Coastguard alerted 
and resuscitation continued during the boat and helicopter 
journey to hospital.  The casualty failed to recover.  A heart 
attack is considered to have been the cause. 
May 1999 99/118 
A pair of divers was diving on a wreck in a depth of 55m.  One 
of the pair seemed to be suffering from narcosis and had to be 
prevented from going deeper.  One of the pair then surfaced 
alone.  The lost diver was recovered from the wreck by another 
member of the party but he was found to be dead. 
May 1999 99/125 
A diver commenced a solo dive to a wreck in a depth of 55m.  
He returned to the surface rapidly 4 mins later. At the surface 
he was unconscious.  There was only one person in the boat 
and recovering him into the boat was difficult.  Assistance was 
requested and a helicopter took the casualty to hospital where 
he was found to be dead.  This diver was using a rebreather.  It 
is believed that his drysuit became over-inflated, although no 
subsequent fault was found with the inflation equipment. This 
diver had suffered from a rupture of his lungs. 
 
June 1999 99/137 
After a dive to 52m for 60 mins, a diver failed to surface.  A 
major search and rescue operation ensued.  Three lifeboats 
and a Coastguard helicopter supported by a navy vessel 
searched for the lost diver throughout the night.  He was not 
found. 
June 1999 99/143 
During the descent a diver became unconscious and sank to 
the seabed at a depth of about 30m.  She was quickly brought 
to the surface by her buddy.  A second boat heard the 
emergency call and went to assist.  When they arrived the 
casualty was still in the water and two divers entered the water 
to assist.  With difficulty she was recovered into the boat.  No 
vital signs could be detected and resuscitation techniques were 
continuously applied whilst the boat took the casualty to the 
nearest harbour.  Once ashore a doctor and an ambulance 
team attended but, despite further resuscitation attempts, the 
casualty was declared to be dead. 
June 1999 99/148 
A diver was struck on the head by the propeller of an RHIB and 
suffered severe injuries.  The Coastguard were called and a 
lifeboat and helicopter dispatched to assist.  The casualty was 
brought ashore but was found to be dead.  (Coastguard & RNLI 
reports). 
June 1999 99/147 
Four pairs of divers entered the water for a drift dive.  Their plan 
was that they would deploy delayed SMBs after 20 mins and 
surface after a maximum time of 40 mins or if the depth 
exceeded 28m.  One of the pairs descended more slowly than 
the others and is thought to have thus encountered different 
water currents that carried them in a different direction to the 
others.  On surfacing this pair found themselves about half a 
mile from the boat, and they were not spotted.  One of the pair 
was carrying a flag attached to his air cylinder but he could not 
release it.  His buddy went behind him to release the flag.  The 
buddy had by this time exhausted her air supply and used a 
snorkel.  The sea conditions were worsening, with waves 
occasionally breaking over the divers.  After a short while the 
first diver realised that his buddy was not releasing the flag and 
when he turned he found her floating face up motionless.  He 
went to her assistance and, realising that she was not 
breathing, commenced AV.  Due to the difficult conditions he 
quickly became exhausted.   The group in the boat realised that 
they had one pair missing and called the Coastguard for 
assistance.  A helicopter, a lifeboat and several other boats 
began a search.  After being on the surface for 70 mins the pair 
were spotted and recovered into the lifeboat.   The casualty was 
taken by helicopter to hospital but further resuscitation attempts 
failed. 
July 1999 99/166 
A diver started a descent with two other divers.  At 20m he 
indicated to the others that he was going to ascend.  The other 
two divers continued their dive.  The lone diver returned to the 
surface and called for help to the boat.  Another diver entered 
the water and found the casualty not breathing, he commenced 
AV and the casualty was recovered into the boat.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and resuscitation continued.  The 
casualty was taken by helicopter to hospital but declared dead 
on arrival, he was found to have choked on his own vomit.

July 1999 99/174 
A diver got into difficulties whilst conducting a shore dive.  His 
buddy brought him to the shore.  Resuscitation attempts were 
made but the casualty failed to recover.  It is thought that a 
heart attack may have been the cause. 
 
 
 
August 1999 99/176 
A diver got into difficulties in the water.  His buddy attempted to 
rescue him but he was recovered dead from the water.  The 
casualty is thought to have suffered a heart attack. 
August 1999 99/196 
A diver using a rebreather entered the water to commence a 
dive.  He was found to be unconscious at the surface and other 
divers went to his aid.  The Coastguard was alerted and a 
helicopter took the diver to hospital.  Resuscitation attempts 
were made but the diver did not recover. 
August 1999 99/203 
Two divers were reported missing.  A helicopter, a fixed wing 
aircraft, a lifeboat, a fishery protection vessel and other boats 
conducted a search.  The divers were not found. 
September 1999 99/219 
17 mins into a dive at a depth of 28m a pair of divers ran into 
difficulties that resulted in them making an ascent sharing air.  
During this ascent one of the pair became unconscious.  The 
Coastguard was alerted to the problem and the pair was airlifted 
to a recompression facility.  The unconscious diver failed to 
recover; the other was successfully recompressed. 
September 1999 99/226 
One of a pair of divers surfaced and raised the alarm that his 
buddy was in difficulties.  This diver was airlifted to a 
recompression facility.  The buddy was quickly recovered from 
the water but failed to respond to resuscitation attempts.

Decompression Incidents 
 
October 1998 99/046 
Two divers made a wreck dive to 41m for a duration of 32 mins.  
During the descent one of the divers lost the use of the inflator 
hose to his diving 'wing' due to a 'bungee' cord failure, which 
allowed it to move out of reach.  He swapped to a second hose.  
Underwater conditions were very dark and the divers were 
unable to find the shotline for their return.  The divers were 2 
mins over their planned bottom time.  The helmet mounted 
lamps of one of the divers dazzled the other, making 
communications difficult.  Both deployed delayed SMBs and the 
lines became tangled on several occasions.  The diver with the 
displaced hose forgot to dump the air from his back-up 
buoyancy aid, and rose rapidly from 15m to the surface, missing 
all stops.  At the surface oxygen was administered and the 
Coastguard alerted.  He was flown by helicopter to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  A full recovery was 
reported. 
October 1998 99/034 
Two divers completed a dive to a maximum depth of 35m for 
32mins, with much of the time at 20m and 10m.  They 
completed 1 min safety stop at 3m.  1 hour 45 mins later they 
dived to a maximum depth of 20m for a dive duration of 33 
mins, of which 15 mins was spent at 10m.  They conducted a 1 
min safety stop at 3m.  15 mins later one of the divers felt dizzy 
and sick and sought advice.  He was given oxygen that 
provided initial relief.  Then he quickly became worse and was 
recompressed.  This resolved his symptoms.  He was kept in 
hospital overnight for observation.  No subsequent ill effects 
were reported. 
October 1998 99/269 
Recompression treatment was required for a diver whose dive 
profile appeared normal.  (Coastguard report). 
October 1998 99/270 
Upon surfacing after collecting shellfish at 23m a diver had 'pins 
and needles' in the arm. The Lifeboat was called and the diver 
was taken for treatment.  (Coastguard report).

November 1998 99/033 
Three divers were making an ascent from a depth of 51m in a 
quarry.  At 33m one made an attempt to change regulators and 
started to hyperventilate.  His buddies helped him to ascend.  
During the ascent one of the buddies gave him his regulator 
and switched to another regulator breathing pure oxygen.  At 
one point they sank back down to 16m.  BCDs were inflated 
and they rose rapidly to the surface.  At the surface the subject 
was semiconscious.  He was suffering from hypothermia.  He 
and one of his buddies, who showed mild symptoms of DCI, 
were flown by helicopter to a recompression facility.  Both 
divers made a good recovery.  (Newspaper report only) 
November 1998 99/271 
Problems dumping air resulted in a rapid ascent. Once ashore, 
Ambulance paramedics assessed and transported the diver for 
treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
November 1998 99/049 
A diver completed a 15 mins dive to 5m.  2 hours later he dived 
again to 25m for 5 mins.  Immediately after the second dive he 
felt uncomfortable in the stomach, a condition which worsened.  
He developed 'pins and needles' in both arms and then loss of 
movement in his hands.  The diver was recompressed and the 
symptoms were resolved.  He was detained in hospital 
overnight for observation. 
November 1998 99/079 
Three divers completed a dive to a maximum depth of 23m.  25 
mins were spent at 20 to 23m and then they ascended to 15m 
over the next 15 mins.  Total dive time 45 mins.  On surfacing 
they had to walk some distance, up a hill,  to return to their cars.  
One hour after surfacing one of the divers noticed a itching of 
his abdomen and upper arms, and this condition worsened over 
the next 30 mins.  Examination revealed red rashes over parts 
of his upper body.  One of the others had similar but less severe 
symptoms.  The divers sought medical advice, were given 
oxygen and taken to a recompression facility for treatment.  
Recompression fully resolved the symptoms. 
November 1998 99/051 
Due to equipment problems, a diver made an uncontrolled 
ascent from 31m and was taken to a recompression facility for 
treatment. 
January 1999 99/276 
An inlet valve stuck open and a dump valve jammed closed 
resulted in a rapid ascent from 17m.  The unlucky diver was 
airlifted to DDRC by RAF helicopter for precautionary treatment.  
(Coastguard report). 
January 1999 99/275 
A dive to 46m for 10 minutes resulted in nitrogen narcosis, 
which caused the diver to lose control and make a rapid ascent. 
The results were DCI and treatment at Dunstaffnage Hyperbaric 
unit.  (Coastguard report). 
January 1999 99/071 
Two trainees and an instructor were involved in a navigation 
exercise.  4 mins into the dive at 20m one of the trainees 
indicated that he needed the alternative air source of the other, 
this was provided, and they started for the surface.  The first 
trainee had buoyancy problems and sank down, pulling the 
regulator mouthpiece off the alternative air source.  The 

NDC Diving Incidents Report - 1999                           
instructor intervened and they used his alternative air source.  
By this time, the second trainee had had his mouthpiece 
knocked from his mouth and he swam for the surface.  At the 
surface he was seen to be in trouble by other divers and was 
assisted from the water.  Shortly afterwards the instructor and 
the first trainee surfaced, also in distress.  Both were monitored 
for DCI.  After 1 hour 30 mins  the trainee who had made the 
free ascent became very unwell, weak, aches and pains, and 
had difficulty breathing.  He was recompressed and responded 
slowly to treatment.  He was admitted to hospital for 
observation.  It was subsequently discovered the first trainee's 
BCD inflation valve was damaged and had leaked a lot of air 
causing him to lose his air supply. 
January 1999 99/277 
A diver was transported by ambulance to Dunstaffnage 
Hyperbaric unit after he reported having difficulty breathing after 
a dive.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
January 1999 99/086 
5 divers completed a dive to a maximum depth of 35m for a 
total time of 34 mins including a 2 min stop at 3m.  After 1 hour 
39 mins they dived again to a maximum depth of 28m for a total 
duration of 41 mins.  That evening one of the divers 
experienced pain in his arm, which progressively worsened.  He 
reported to a recompression facility and received treatment.  
This resolved the symptoms. 
April 1999 99/128 
2 divers descended a slope to a wreck at a depth of 30m.  At 
this point one of the pair experienced buoyancy problems and 
was on the edge of panic.  His buddy managed to control the 
situation and he settled as they started back up the slope.  At 
25m he indicated a problem with his fin and his buddy 
attempted to tighten it for him.  During this they started to rise 
and the troubled diver was unable to dump air from his drysuit 
rapidly enough.  They made a buoyant ascent to the surface.  
Total dive duration 15 mins.  Later that afternoon the diver 
became confused and was taken to a recompression facility for 
treatment.  Two days later he felt nausea, dizziness and a loss 
of feeling in his arm.  He was given further recompression 
treatment and this resolved all his symptoms except for a slight 
residual loss of feeling in his left hand. 
April 1999 99/112 
Two divers were 8 mins into a dive at a depth of 15m when one 
stopped to adjust his weightbelt.  The weightbelt was 
accidentally dropped and the diver started a buoyant ascent.  
His buddy caught up and attempted to slow him, but they were 
both carried to the surface.  They were recovered into their 
boat.  The diver with the lost belt was seasick and complained 
of a wrist pain.  Further symptoms developed - pain in forearm, 
elbows, back and knees and tingling in the fingers.  With no 
oxygen and other divers still in the water, the Coastguard was 
called for assistance by VHF radio.  35 mins after surfacing a 
helicopter arrived and took both to a recompression facility.  
The diver with symptoms was recompressed and the other kept 
under observation.  A full recovery was reported. 
 
April 1999 99/227 
Two divers descended an anchor line to a depth of 33m.  
During the dive they moved up to a depth of 18m.  At this point 
one of the divers experienced problems controlling his 
buoyancy as he was unable to release air from his drysuit.  He 
became inverted and began to fin downwards.  He was able to 
exchange the 'go up' signal with his buddy and then made an 
uncontrolled buoyant ascent to the surface.  His dive time was 
18 mins.  His buddy made a normal ascent including a 1 min 
stop at 6m.  At the surface the buoyant diver was in distress 
and help from another boat was required to get him out of the 
water.  Oxygen was offered but refused.  The group recovered 
other divers and then returned to the shore.  Just over an hour 
after surfacing the buoyant diver noticed a tingling in his right 
arm and chest, and was given oxygen.  The Coastguard was 
alerted and a helicopter tasked to take him to a recompression 
facility.  He was recompressed and received oxygen treatment 
for the following two weeks. 
April 1999 99/186 
Two divers completed a 25 mins dive to a depth of 38m, they 
started their ascent during which they anticipated 25 mins 
decompression stops.  One of the divers was using a BCD 
which he had serviced himself and in which, unknown to him, a 
wire operating a dump valve had not been connected.  They 
planned to decompress under a buoy which they deployed at 
15m.  The diver with the faulty BCD dump thought that he had 
been dumping air and when he operated the dump at 15m and 
nothing escaped he assumed, incorrectly, that it was empty.  
The diver then lost control of his buoyancy and made a fast 
ascent to the surface, the other diver correctly completed his 
stops.  At the surface the buoyant diver signalled the boat for 
assistance and was recovered into it.  He was placed on 
oxygen and began to experience a tingling in his feet and 
hands.  The Coastguard was alerted and a helicopter was 
tasked to take the casualty to a recompression facility, the 
buddy was also taken.  The buoyant diver was recompressed 
three times over three days.  His symptoms were fully resolved.  
The buddy suffered no ill effects and was not recompressed.  
April 1999 99/134 
Two divers were 23 mins into a dive at a depth of 25m when the 
weightbelt buckle of one of the divers became unfastened.  This 
diver made a buoyant ascent to the surface, his buddy followed 
as fast as he could.  No symptoms were evident and, 4 hours 
later, they dived again to 7m for 29 mins.  Later that night the 
diver who had made the buoyant ascent experienced pains in 
his knees.  The following night he sought medical advice and 
both divers were given recompression treatment.  4 weeks later 
this diver started diving again.  He completed a dive to 35m with 
a 3 mins safety stop, then, after a surface interval of 1 hour a 
second dive to 20m, again with a safety stop.  The following day 
he again experienced pains and received further recompression 
treatment. 
April 1999 99/120 
A pair of divers entered the water for a dive to 15m for a 
planned duration of 45m.  After 18 mins they resurfaced, one 15 
seconds before the other.  They reported that underwater 
visibility was almost zero and that one of the pair had made a 
faster than normal ascent from about 12m.  3 hours 30 mins 
later the diver who had made the fast ascent felt the skin on his 
knee to be itchy.  He sought medical advice and was give 
oxygen.  After a further 3 hours 30 mins it worsened and he was 
referred to a recompression facility for treatment.  He was told 
that he had a category 6 air embolism.  The following day the 
symptoms had gone. 
May 1999 99/127 
A diver completed a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 28m.  
He ascended to a shallower part of the wreck with 2 mins of no 
stop time showing on his computer, and then ascended the 
shotline to a depth of 6m.  Here 7 mins of no stop time were 
indicated by the computer.  The diver completed a 2 mins safety 
stop and surfaced.  2 hours later this diver experienced a 
shoulder ache.  20 mins later a skin rash appeared.  Oxygen 
was administered and assistance sought.  He then experienced

  NDC Diving Incidents Report - 1999 
a tingling sensation in his hands.  He was flown to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  This fully resolved his 
symptoms. 
May 1999 99/122 
10 mins into a dive at a depth of 12m one of a pair of divers 
started to get water into her mouthpiece.  She switched to her 
buddy's alternative air source.  She began to panic and was not 
breathing properly.  At the surface she was in distress and had 
difficulty breathing.  She suffered from asthma and used an 
inhaler.  She developed 'pins and needles' in her right leg and 
some loss of mobility.  She was recompressed in a 
recompression chamber and then kept in hospital overnight for 
observation.  She was discharged the following day.  Her 
regulator mouthpiece was found to have a small hole in it. 
May 1999 99/297 
A female diver made a rapid ascent and suffered 'pins and 
needles'.  She was airlifted to hospital by Air Ambulance.  
(Coastguard report). 
May 1999 99/301 
Three divemasters were diving in a threesome. One ran out of 
air and all three immediately returned to the surface, omitting 
decompression stops. All divers experienced pains in shoulders 
and forearms and were transferred to Haslar Hyperbaric Unit.  
(Coastguard report). 
May 1999 99/304 
Two divers dived to 28.7m for 36 mins. Both ascended without 
making stops (possibly due to buoyancy difficulties).  Both 
displayed DCI symptoms and were conveyed to Poole 
Hyperbaric Unit for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
May 1999 99/140 
Two divers made a dive to a wreck at a maximum of 52m.  
There was a strong current. They used a line attached to the 
bottom of the shotline to guide their return.  When they began 
their return to the shot, their line became entangled in its reel.  
To save time the other diver signalled that he would gather in 
the line and that it should be sorted out at the surface.  The 
diver gathering the line became too buoyant and began to float 
upwards.  He caught hold of the wreck but realised that his 
buddy was being carried away by the current.  He pulled her 
back with the line joining them.  At this point the buoyant diver 
mistakenly inflated his BCD instead of dumping air as intended 
(he believes that he was suffering narcosis) and began a 
buoyant ascent from 36m.  Realising that he was also pulling 
his buddy up he released the line and ascended buoyantly to 
the surface.  He was recovered into the boat and placed on 
oxygen.  The buddy completed a normal ascent including an 8 
min decompression stop at 6m as indicated by her computer.  
During this stop she was joined by another member of their 
group and used his octopus for 2 mins because her own air 
supply had become depleted.  Emergency assistance was 
sought and both divers received recompression treatment. 
May 1999 99/305 
A diver experienced pain to his right shoulder 10 mins after 
surfacing. His last dive (17.7m for 36 mins) had been midday 
the previous day. He was airlifted by military helicopter to the 
Dunstaffnage Hyperbaric Unit.  (Coastguard report).  
May 1999 99/307 
A diver suffered type 2 DCI following a non-stop dive to 32m for 
33 mins. He was taken by helicopter to Aberdeen Hyperbaric 
Unit for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
May 1999 99/308 
A diver was conveyed to the DDRC by friends following 
lightheadedness after surfacing from a 15m dive.  (Coastguard 
report).

June 1999 99/173 
Two divers completed a dive to a maximum depth of 31m for 38 
mins.  2 hours 44 mins later they dived again, this time to 33m.  
The dive duration was 44 mins and they completed a total of 13 
mins of decompression stops.  One of the pair completed 5 
mins of decompression at 6m, as indicated by her computer, 
and then conducted an extra 4 mins decompression at 5m to 
remain with her buddy whose computer indicated extra 
decompression requirements; the first diver's computer had 
already 'cleared'.  On surfacing this first diver experienced a 
sharp pain in her left elbow.  She was placed on oxygen and the 
Coastguard alerted.  The casualty was brought ashore by 
lifeboat and then taken by helicopter to a recompression facility 
for treatment. 
June 1999 99/316 
A diver suffered type 2 DCI some 2.5 hours after a dive to 
20.4m. He was airlifted to Kishorn Hyperbaric unit for treatment.  
(Coastguard report). 
June 1999 99/317 
DCI symptoms became apparent to a diver during the evening 
following an afternoon dive. Self treatment of paracetamol and 
oxygen failed to effect a cure so he was admitted for hyperbaric 
treatment.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports) 
 
 
June 1999 99/136 
Following two 30m dives in one day a diver suffered pain to his 
shoulder.  He was airlifted to DDRC Derriford for treatment.  
(Coastguard report). 
June 1999 99/320 
A diver surfaced with a headache and later complained of 'pins 
and needles'. The boat skipper called for help and the casualty 
was airlifted by CG helo to Poole hyperbaric unit.  (Coastguard 
report).

After a dive to 52m a diver lost his weightbelt and made a rapid 
ascent. He surfaced with blood over his face so was airlifted by 
CG helicopter to Haslar hyperbaric unit. This was the first of two 
major incidents from this boat in one day!  (Coastguard report). 
June 1999 99/197 
Two divers conducted a dive down a sloping wreck to a depth of 
43m.  At this point one of the divers began to feel light-headed 
and had difficulty focusing.  He ascended to 30m but his 
condition got worse.  His buddy approached him and tried to 
attract his attention but got no response.  The light-headed 
diver then decided to ascend directly to the surface.  He 
remembered trying to release air from his drysuit and seeing 
17m showing on his depth gauge.  He also remembered feeling 
concern that he might start to sink back down.  He arrived at the 
surface and called for help.  He was recovered into his boat and 
given oxygen.  The Coastguard was alerted and a lifeboat 
launched to take him to a recompression facility for treatment.  
A neurological bend was diagnosed.  His buddy met up with 
another pair of divers and ascended with them. 
June 1999 99/261 
A dive to 30m resulted in DCI symptoms.  The diver was 
airlifted from the dive charter vessel and taken to Poole 
hyperbaric unit for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
June 1999 99/263 
Two divers surfaced missing 28 mins decompression stops.  
The Coastguard was alerted and a helicopter tasked to 
evacuate the divers.  The divers were transferred to another 
boat and then flown to a recompression facility. 
June 1999 99/188 
Two divers were surfacing from a 25 mins dive on a wreck to a 
maximum depth of 41m.  At 10m they stopped to deploy a 
delayed SMB.  One of the pair lost control of his buoyancy and 
ascended to the surface, missing 6 mins of stops, his buddy 
completed the required stops.  The buoyant diver was 
recovered into the boat and put on oxygen.  At the same time 
divers from another nearby boat surfaced missing 30 mins of 
stops.  They had no oxygen.  They were given oxygen and the 
Coastguard alerted.  A helicopter was tasked to take them to a 
recompression facility.  When the helicopter arrived the diver 
who had missed 6 mins of stops had developed a severe 
headache and 'pins and needles' in his upper arms, so he too 
was taken into the helicopter along with his buddy.  This diver 
received recompression treatment.  
June 1999 99/322 
A quarry dive to 50m involved the Coastguard when a 999 call 
was made to them. A diver had become unconscious on the 
ascent of a 50m dive. He was airlifted by RAF helicopter to 
Thingwall hyperbaric unit where he made a full recovery.  
(Coastguard report). 
June 1999 99/325 
Two divers suffered DCI when they made a fast ascent (depth 
unknown). They were brought ashore and taken to hospital prior 
to Coastguard involvement.  (Coastguard report). 
June 1999 99/327 
A dive to 20m and a subsequent lost fin resulted in panic and a 
fast ascent. DCI symptoms soon materialised and the diver was 
airlifted to Poole Hyperbaric unit by Coastguard rescue 
helicopter.  (Coastguard report). 
June 1999 99/191 
A diver completed a dive to 35m for 59 mins including 18 mins 
stops.  4 hours 50 mins later he dived again to 33m for 31 mins 
with a 3 mins safety stop.  30 mins after surfacing he 
complained of a headache and feeling hot and giddy.  He then 
became confused.  The Coastguard was alerted and the diver 
was given oxygen.  On reaching shore he was taken by 
ambulance to a recompression facility, a cerebral bend was 
diagnosed and he was recompressed. 
July 1999 99/193 
Following a dive to 37m a diver lost his weightbelt on the 
ascent.  He and his buddy then made a rapid ascent.  Both 
were airlifted to Poole hyperbaric unit by Coastguard helo.  
(Coastguard report). 
July 1999 99/195 
A dive vessel reported a diver had make a rapid ascent and had 
missed stops.  He was airlifted by the Coastguard helo to Poole 
hyperbaric unit.  (Coastguard report). 
July 1999 99/332 
A solo cave diver at St Kilda ran out of air and made a rapid 
ascent. He was unconscious and not breathing on the surface. 
Following  successful resuscitation, he was airlifted to 
Dunstaffnage hyperbaric unit. The dive was to 51.8m for 30 
mins.  (Coastguard report). 
July 1999 99/233 
A diver who regularly suffered from migraine completed a series 
of dives during a week's diving holiday.  She suffered a number 
of headaches and migraine attacks during the week.  She also 
noticed that her breasts were swollen.  The following week, 
whilst at work, she noticed some untypical symptoms; memory 
and balance loss, and she sought medical advice.  She 
attended a recompression facility, was diagnosed as having a 
cerebral bend and received treatment.  She reported other 
recent occurrences of problems, after diving, that were put 
down to migraine, at the time, but may have also been diving 
related. 
July 1999 99/334 
A 15 year old diver suffered DCI symptoms following a wreck 
dive. He went to hospital but was transferred to DDRC by 
military helicopter.  (Coastguard report). 
July 1999 99/184 
Two divers had completed a dive to 15m and one commenced 
to deploy a delayed SMB.  He had difficulty inflating the buoy.  
He used his main regulator instead of his octopus regulator.  He 
then lost grip on his regulator and was unable to find it again.  
He mistakenly tried to breathe from his buddy's BCD inflator 
and his buddy found it difficult to give him his octopus regulator 
due to the mounting panic.  The diver then started a rapid 
ascent to the surface.  His buddy held on to him and went with 
him, concerned that he would be lost in the poor visibility.  They 
arrived at the surface and were recovered into the boat.  Their 
dive duration was 38 mins.  Both divers were placed on oxygen.  
The buddy then noticed a tingling sensation in his hands and 
fingertips.  The Coastguard was alerted and both divers taken 
by helicopter to a recompression facility where the buddy was 
treated. 
July 1999 99/338 
A 17 year old diver and buddy dived to 23.2m.  She lost her 
buddy and panicked, the weightbelt was dropped and she made

a rapid ascent. She had suspected DCI symptoms so was 
conveyed to hospital by Ambulance.  (Coastguard report). 
July 1999 99/237 
A diver dived to 24m for 23 mins and completed 3 mins 
decompression at 6m.  1 hour 15 mins later he dived again to 
16m for 31 mins and completed 3 mins decompression at 6m.  
Later he was helping to unload the boat when he felt a pain in 
his left arm.  He was given nitrox 64 and then oxygen.  He 
sought medical advice and was given recompression treatment 
that resolved the problem.  
July 1999 99/192 
Two divers completed a dive to 71m then ran out of air with 25 
mins of decompression remaining.  They initially refused to 
attend a recompression facility but it is believed that one was 
subsequently treated for a shoulder bend. 
July 1999 99/339 
A 16 year old diver surfaced with DCI symptoms. He and his 
buddy were airlifted for hyperbaric treatment by the Coastguard 
Helo.  (Coastguard report). 
July 1999 99/341 
A nitrox (26/74) diver dived to 41m with 30 mins bottom time. 
Stops at 9m for 3 mins and 6m for 23 mins. Despite this, he 
complained of lack of balance and sickness. The diver was 
airlifted to Haslar hyperbaric unit by Coastguard helicopter.  
(Coastguard report). 
July 1999 99/240 
A diver completed a dive to 69m, on trimix, for a duration of 104 
mins including 27 mins decompression at 3m.  24 hours later he 
dived again to 62m, using air, for 100 mins including 24 mins 
decompression at 3m.  Decompression in both cases was 
conducted using nitrox 41 and oxygen.  Shortly after surfacing 
the diver experienced a pain in both elbows.  He was placed on 
oxygen and then flown to a recompression facility for treatment. 
He was recompressed for a second time the following day.  He 
reported having experienced elbow pain after previous dives. 
July 1999 99/210 
A diver had completed four dives over a two day period.  On the 
second day he dived to 41m for 40 mins with 18 mins 
decompression, then again 5 hours 52 mins later to 45m for 29 
mins with 13 mins decompression.  
 
Later that day he helped to unload the boat, which involved 
heavy work, pulling equipment up onto a jetty.  He felt a twinge 
across one shoulder.  The following morning this shoulder had 
swollen considerably, and pain and restricted movement were 
experienced.  Medical advice was sought and the diver placed 
on oxygen.  20 mins later the problem had subsided. 
July 1999 99/344 
A diver who dived to 27.4m for 40 mins suffered DCI some 10 
mins after his ascent. He was airlifted from St Kilda by 
Coastguard helicopter to Dunstaffnage hyperbaric unit. He had 
dived twice the previous day (25.3 and 33.9m).  (Coastguard 
report). 
July 1999 99/347 
A diver was landed ashore from a dive boat suffering from 
suspected DCI.  He was airlifted by RAF helicopter to hospital.  
(Coastguard report). 
July 1999 99/348 
A diver made a rapid ascent and showed signs of DCI on the 
surface. She was airlifted to DDRC by RAF helicopter.  
(Coastguard report). 
August 1999 99/223 
A diver completed a dive to 19m for 36 mins.  1 hour 30 mins 
later he dived again, this time to 32m for a maximum time of 35 
mins.  He and his buddy made their ascent back up the shotline 
and got to 15m before they reached the point where they had 
attached the distance line to the shotline.  The diver instructed 
his buddy to remain on the line whilst he redescended to 28m to 
check that the shot weight was free.  Although it was heavy he 
moved the shot clear of the wreck, and returned to his buddy.  
They then ascended using the buddy's computer to control their 
decompression, as the first diver did not have his computer with 
him on that dive.  They completed 2 mins at 12m,  3 mins at 6m 
and then surfaced.  On return into their boat the diver who had 
moved the shot weight felt a sharp pain in his left shoulder and 
he put this down to a pulled muscle.  He took pain killers but the 
pain remained and his arm became numb.  The following day 
he was still in pain and unable to use his arm.  He sought 
medical advice and received treatment at a recompression 
facility. 
August 1999 99/252 
Two divers descended their anchor line but found it caught up 
on a lobster pot line at a depth of 25m.  They followed the line 
downwards to a point where it split in two directions, they 
followed one of the lines to find a lobster pot suspended at 35m.  
They returned to the surface after a total dive time of 7 mins.  
After a surface interval of 25 mins they dived again.  They dived 
to a depth of 42m.  After 6 mins on the bottom, the computer of 
one of the divers showed a requirement for 2 mins 
decompression at 3m.  This requirement cleared during their 
ascent but they conducted 2 mins decompression at 9m and 5 
mins at 6m as a precaution.  Back on the boat one of the pair 
developed a tightness in his chest and 'pins and needles' in his 
legs.  He was placed on oxygen, the Coastguard was alerted 
and he was flown by helicopter to a recompression facility for 
treatment.  During recompression the symptoms worsened, the 
'pins and needles' spread to his chest and his legs became 
numb.  He received two recompression treatments per day for 
the next 8 days.  At the time of the report the diver had 
progressed to the stage where he could walk with the aid of 
sticks.  
August 1999 99/350 
A first dive to 25m for 30 mins resulted in a diver being taken 
directly to a hyperbaric unit by lifeboat. Poor procedures 
resulted in the Coastguard hearing about this incident in a very 
roundabout route.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
August 1999 99/352 
Shortly after surfacing from a dive, a diver complained of 
weakness and back pain. He was airlifted by a Coastguard 
helicopter to a hyperbaric unit.  (Coastguard report). 
August 1999 99/353 
A diver who made a rapid ascent from 60m suffered DCI 
symptoms and was airlifted by RAF helicopter to a hyperbaric 
unit.  (Coastguard report). 
August 1999 99/354 
Two divers were airlifted by Coastguard Helicopter to a 
hyperbaric unit following a report of tingling fingers some 25 
mins after surfacing from a 32m dive.  (Coastguard report).

August 1999 99/212 
A diver conducted a dive to 20m for 20 mins and completed a 1 
min safety stop at 6m.  The following day she awoke with a pain 
and tenderness in her abdomen.  She sought medical advice 
and was recompressed.  This treatment provided nearly full 
pain relief. 
August 1999 99/355 
Following a dive to 46m, and despite the correct stops being 
carried out, a diver showed signs of DCI. He and his buddy 
were airlifted by Coastguard helicopter to a hyperbaric unit for 
treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
August 1999 99/246 
A diver completed a dive to 58m and conducted the following 
stops 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 4 and 21 mins at 21, 18, 15, 12, 9, 6 and 
4.5m respectively.  During the last two stops he was breathing 
nitrox 85.  As he entered the boat the boat rolled and his arm 
was wrenched.  6 hours later he experienced pain in his arm 
that spread.  He decided not to dive the next day and spent a 
restless night with increasing pain.  In the morning the arm was 
unusable and he reported to a recompression facility.  He 
received recompression over a 3 day period.  The diagnosis 
was a muscular and skeletal bend with slight neurological 
effect.  He was advised not to dive for 3 months.

A diver completed a dive to 28m for 36 mins. He conducted 4 
mins of safety stops at 6m.  15 mins after surfacing he 
complained of 'pins and needles' in his right hand.  This spread 
across his body affecting both arms and legs.  His skin became 
hypersensitive.  The diver was unable to stand.  He was lain 
down and given oxygen.  The Coastguard was alerted and the 
diver taken by helicopter to a recompression facility where he 
received treatment.  The symptoms had disappeared before he 
arrived at the recompression facility.  The two other divers with 
whom he had been diving suffered no ill effects. 
August 1999 99/358 
5 dives within the depth range of 19 to 39.5m in the proceeding 
48 hours, plus a final dive to 21.5m for 52 mins with a 
calculated total of 190 mins of missed stops resulted in DCI for 
this instructor. He was given hyperbaric treatment, but advised 
not to dive for 3 months.  (Coastguard report). 
August 1999 99/249 
Two divers descended a shotline to a wreck.  At 28m one of the 
pair signalled that all was not well, his buddy gave the ascend 
signal but there was no response.  The troubled diver was 
holding on to the shotline and fumbling with his suit inflator.  
The buddy discovered that it was not connected but could not 
reattach the hose.  The buddy tried to lift him using his BCD but 
as soon as the troubled diver released the shotline he began to 
ascend; he had dropped his weightbelt.  Despite attempts to 
control the ascent both divers rose rapidly to the surface, with 
the buoyant diver becoming increasingly panicked.  Both divers 
were recovered into the boat and placed on oxygen.  The 
Coastguard was alerted.  The boat was escorted ashore by two 
lifeboats.  The panicked diver was showing signs of DCI and 
was taken by ambulance to hospital.  He was then transferred 
to a recompression facility by helicopter and was 
recompressed. 
August 1999 99/360 
A diver drifted in and out of consciousness at 50m. He made a 
rapid ascent, missing 21 mins of stops. He surfaced with type 2 
DCI. His buddy also made a rapid ascent, this time from 25m. 
Both were airlifted, by military helicopter, for recompression 
treatment.  (Coastguard report).  
August 1999 99/224 
A diver completed a series of dives over a one week diving 
holiday.  On the last day he completed two dives; one to 41m 
for 30 mins with 4 mins decompression, the second, 4 hours 
later, to 26m for 39 mins with 3 mins decompression.  Later that 
evening he engaged in an 'arm wrestling contest' at which 
significant effort was made.  Soon afterwards he complained of 
increasing severe pain in his shoulder, elbow and wrist joint of 
his right arm.  He sought medical advice and was 
recompressed.  It is reported that all symptoms were resolved 
by recompression. 
August 1999 99/361 
A diver on holiday had  been doing 2 dives a day, the last being 
to 25.5m for 40 mins. Type 2 DCI developed within 45 mins of 
surfacing. He was airlifted to a hyperbaric unit for treatment.  
(Coastguard report). 
August 1999 99/250 
Three divers completed a dive to 36m for 32 mins including 4 
mins decompression stop at 6m and 1 min at 3m as a 
precaution.  Over 5 hours later they dived again to 19m.  One of 
the pair had lost his weightbelt after the earlier dive and 
borrowed one for this second dive; this belt was a little too 
heavy.  During the dive they encountered a current and one of 
the three got out of breath trying to keep up with the dive leader.  
He signalled the problem and they ascended to a shallower part 
of the wreck at a depth of 15m.  He signalled that he wished to 
ascend and struggled to control his breathing.  They made a 
normal ascent including a 1 mins stop at 6m.  At the surface the 
breathless diver was found to be semiconscious and was 
recovered into the boat.  He was given oxygen and the 
Coastguard alerted.  The boat returned to shore.  The casualty 
reported that he had 'pins and needles' in his left foot and a 
tingling in his left hand.  After 30 mins the casualty was taken by 
helicopter to a recompression facility for treatment.  He was 
diagnosed as having a type 2 neurological bend.  He made a 
full recovery. 
August 1999 99/363 
A fast ascent from 28m after 15 mins and subsequent coughing 
up of blood led to this diver being taken to a hyperbaric unit by 
lifeboat.  (Coastguard report). 
August 1999 99/364 
Two dives, one to 17m for 30 mins and a second to 17m for 25 
mins, led to this diver feeling generally unwell. He was taken for 
hyperbaric treatment by ambulance.  (Coastguard report). 
August 1999 99/365 
A diver suffering from DCI was airlifted by military helicopter to 
a hyperbaric unit for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
August 1999 99/368 
A diver with chest pains and 'pins and needles' was airlifted to a 
hyperbaric unit for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
August 1999 99/369 
A diver suffering from 'pins and needles' was taken to hospital 
by ambulance after the club RHIB had landed him ashore.  
(Coastguard report).

 September 1999 99/253 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 47m.  After 
16 mins they started to ascend.  They stopped for 1 min at 20m, 
1 min at 12m, 15 mins at 6m and 3 mins at 3m.  Both divers' 
computers were clear before they surfaced.  90 mins after 
surfacing one of the divers complained of an itchy back and his 
left shoulder was found to be covered with red and blue 
blotches.  He lay down and was given oxygen and fluids.  After 
1 hour the blotches had mainly gone.  This dive was the ninth in 
a series of dives during a diving holiday. 
September 1999 99/371 
A diver was airlifted to the DDRC suffering from CAGE,  
following a 31m dive for 20 mins with a stop at 6m.  
(Coastguard report). 
September 1999 99/373 
A wreck dive to 34m, 15 min bottom time and stops at 9 and 6m 
still resulted in 'pins and needles'. The diver was taken to a 
hyperbaric unit by Air Ambulance.  (Coastguard report). 
September 1999 99/374 
A diver and his buddy were airlifted by Coastguard Helicopter to 
a hyperbaric unit after one of them complained of type 2 DCI 
following a dive.  (Coastguard report). 
 
September 1999 99/257 
A diver completed a dive to 32m for a duration of 28 mins.  3 
hours 2 mins later he dived again to 14m for 39 mins.  On his 
return to shore he had an itchiness and an ache in his upper 
right arm.  His skin showed a red and blue rash.  He was taken 
to a recompression facility for treatment.  Recompression 
resolved his symptoms. 
September 1999 99/380 
A 41m dive, strong current and horizontal shotline resulted in 
two divers becoming low on air and making a rapid ascent, 
missing 9 mins of stops. Both showed signs of DCI on 
surfacing. Both were airlifted to a hyperbaric unit.  (Coastguard 
report).

Injury / Illness 
 
October 1998 99/076 
A diver was diagnosed as having a ruptured eardrum the day 
after a 'Try Dive' session in a swimming pool. 
October 1998 99/390 
Lifeboat launched to help diver with illness.  (RNLI report). 
October 1998 99/037 
A diver was participating in a drysuit course.  He had poor 
buoyancy control and made many ascents and descents, this 
resulted in injury to his ear. 
November 1998 99/047 
During an instructor training course students were practising 
lifting themselves from the shallow end of the pool onto the pool 
side in snorkelling equipment.  One student had difficulty in doing 
this and sustained a dislocated finger.  He was taken to hospital 
for treatment. 
November 1998 99/048 
After completing two dives, the second of which included a 
practised emergency ascent, a diver complained of severe chest 
pains.  He was very cold and had suffered a flooded drysuit.  He 
was given oxygen and taken by ambulance to hospital.  He was 
discharged 2 hours later. 
November 1998 99/065 
After a 38 min dive to a maximum depth of 35m, which included 
a long swim at 20m, a diver became breathless during a 3 min 
safety stop at 9m.  Once out of the water she was given oxygen 
and soon recovered.  She was thought to have the start of a 
cold. 
December 1998 99/066 
A diver experienced back and arm pains after a dive to 36m for 
18 mins with 7 mins stops.  The dive ended with a long surface 
swim.  The diver was kept under observation for 1 hour.  The 
pains reduced and the problem was considered to be related to a 
previous back injury. 
December 1998 99/068 
8 mins into a dive, at a depth of 35m, a diver burped and vomited 
into his mouthpiece without warning.  He was able to breathe 
and he headed for the surface.  As he neared the surface he 
managed to start breathing normally.  No subsequent ill effects 
were reported. 
January 1999 99/070 
A diver completed a 20 min dive to 18m.  Some time after the 
dive the diver felt dizzy and started to lose his sight.  This 
developed to a total sight loss although his co-ordination was 
fine.  After about 5 mins in a warm room his sight returned.  He 
was taken to hospital where no cause of the problem could be 
found.  Subsequently it was proposed that acute occipital lobe 
ischaemia could have been the cause. 
January 1999 99/072 
A diver was overweighted and sank in the water.  He got out of 
breath and couldn't settle down.  He then over-inflated and made 
a fast ascent to the surface.  Dive depth 20m, total time 5 mins.  
That evening he developed a bad headache, and the following 
morning a shoulder pain.  He was examined for other symptoms 
of DCI and none were found.  He was advised that 
recompression was not needed and he steadily improved. 
January 1999 99/073 
During an oxygen course, in a class room, a student fainted.  He 
was semiconscious, dazed and unaware of his surroundings.  He 
was given oxygen and 30 mins later was fully recovered. 
February 1999 99/082 
A diver experienced problems clearing his ears during a descent.  
He and his buddy ascended to 9m where the ear could be 
cleared.  The dive was conducted at 9m and no pain was felt.  
After the dive, blood was found coming from the ear.  The diver 
sought medical attention but inflammation of the ear prevented 
the exact problem from being determined. 
February 1999 99/100 
A diver damaged her eardrum during the ascent from 18m. 
March 1999 99/090 
3 divers conducted a dive to 17m.  14 mins into the dive one of 
the divers started to fidget with her equipment and indicated that 
she wanted to ascend.  At the surface she seem to be alright.  
She was towed ashore and helped from the water.  She started 
to explain her problem and then fainted.  She drifted in and out of 
consciousness.  Assistance was called and she was flown by 
helicopter to hospital for examination.  No recompression was 
conducted and she was released after a few hours. 
March 1999 99/104 
At the end of a day's diving a diver felt dizzy and had a problem 
with his ear.  He also complained that the neck seal of his new 
drysuit was too tight, and that he had been affected by the stress 
of the training course that he was on.  The next day he had 
recovered. 
April 1999 99/264 
A diver slipped and hit his back whilst loading equipment onto a 
dive boat. 
April 1999 99/126 
Two divers entered the water to dive on a submerged pinnacle.  
There was a current and they missed the pinnacle and dived into 
deep water.  One of the pair did not put enough air into her 
drysuit and began to descend rapidly.  At 28m she felt severe 
ear pain, became disorientated and began to panic.  She 
grabbed her buddy by the regulator.  The buddy brought her to 
the surface using a controlled buoyant lift.  The Coastguard was 
contacted and they were advised to take her to hospital, which 
they did.  A strained eardrum was diagnosed. 
April 1999 99/294 
A diver made a rapid ascent  from 7m whilst undergoing 
navigation training. Medical advice was obtained from the 
hyperbaric unit and the diver was taken to hospital suffering from 
hypothermia.  (Coastguard report). 
April 1999 99/292 
After a dive to 9m for 19 minutes a diver complained of shoulder

pains. After medical advice from hyperbaric unit the diver was 
taken to a general hospital for assessment.  (Coastguard report). 
May 1999 99/131 
Two divers made a descent to a wreck at a depth of 50m.  At the 
bottom, one of the pair turned to his buddy and saw two divers; 
he thought that they had been joined by other members of their 
party.  He felt fine but when he looked again he could see three 
divers.  He realised he had a problem when he saw that the 
three images were moving as one.  He gave the 'something is 
wrong' signal and let air into his drysuit to make an ascent.  He 
felt that he was 'in a green orb' but managed to make an ascent 
to the surface.  He was recovered into the boat and placed on 
oxygen.  He suffered some loss of feeling in one foot.  He was 
taken ashore, by which time all symptoms had disappeared.  He 
was given a medical examination but no problem could be found.  
No further treatment was given.  He is believed to have suffered 
from narcosis. 
May 1999 99/129 
A diver was attempting to fit his diving equipment when he 
sustained an injury to his back.  He collapsed to the ground in 
pain and could not move.  He was taken to hospital where a 
prolapsed spinal disc was diagnosed. 
May 1999 99/124 
A diver was practising breath holding snorkel dives in a 
swimming pool, trying to swim 2 lengths of the pool.  He was 
seen lying on the bottom of the shallow end of the pool by other 
branch members.  One of these people thought that he might be 
in difficulties and reached underwater to lift him to the surface.  
He was found to be unconscious and not breathing.  They lifted 
him from the pool, summoned an ambulance and started 
resuscitation.  He soon started to breathe for himself and began 
to regain consciousness.  He was taken to hospital by 
ambulance. 
May 1999 99/157 
Two divers had dived to a maximum depth of 36m.  24 mins into 
the dive, at a depth of 20m, one of the pair started to cough and 
choke.  They aborted the dive.  At the surface the diver was 
shaken but otherwise unharmed. 
May 1999 99/135 
A diver was helping to park a boat and trailer on a jetty at night.  
He tripped on an eyebolt on the ground, fell backwards, and 
dropped 1m onto a concrete slipway, hitting his back and head 
on the ground.  He was examined for injury and no breaks were 
found.  He recovered and was able to walk away.  The following 
day, despite aches and stiffness, he was able to dive in the 
afternoon.  Subsequent medical examination revealed no serious 
injury. 
May 1999 99/413 
Lifeboat launched to help diver with illness.  (RNLI report). 
May 1999 99/154 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 17m.  The 
dive was terminated after 36 mins because one of the pair felt 
cold.  1 hour after the dive this diver felt a dull ache in her knee.  
After a further 2 hours she was sick.  It was also noted that her 
eye movement was a little jerky when following a moving object.  
She was placed on oxygen and taken to hospital.  After medical 
checks she was released. 
June 1999 99/415 
Lifeboat launched to help diver with illness.  (RNLI report). 
June 1999 99/155 
After a dive to 21m for 25 mins, with 2 mins decompression 
stops, two divers complained of headaches, one also developed 
shoulder pains.  No other signs of DCI were found.  After a 
further hour both had recovered. 
June 1999 99/160 
After a dive to 15m for a duration of 22 mins a diver suffered a 
bloodshot eye as a result of mask squeeze. 
June 1999 99/150 
A diver conducted two dives to 6m and one to 11m.  She had 
earache following these dives, a condition which worsened 
overnight.   The following day she dived again to 6m, but 3 mins 
into the dive suffered a severe pain in her neck, head and ear, 
and she felt sick.  The dive was aborted. 
June 1999 99/151 
A diver conducted a series of dives over two days.  After the first 
day she felt breathless and put this down to a tight diving suit.  
The second day, with a looser suit, she dived again but again 
suffered from breathlessness.  An hour after leaving the water 
she was breathless again and was placed on oxygen.  She was 
taken to hospital where a damaged left lung was diagnosed and 
she was given extensive oxygen therapy. 
June 1999 99/177 
Three divers completed a 60 mins dive to a maximum depth of 
5m.  At the end of the dive they left the water by some stone 
steps.  At the top of the steps one of the divers bent over the 
side to clear her mouth and overbalanced.  She fell about 8 feet 
into about 1 foot of water.  The diver later attended hospital for a 
foot x-ray, and a sprained ankle was diagnosed. 
June 1999 99/161 
After 26 mins into a dive at a depth of 33m two divers started 
their ascent.  At 7m one of the pair lost control of his buoyancy 
and made a fast ascent.  At the surface he had breathing 
difficulties.  He was placed on oxygen and, although this eased 
the problem, he was still unwell.  He was taken by ambulance to 
hospital and detained overnight.  He is believed to have suffered 
from an existing, non diving related, congestion of his lungs. 
June 1999 99/172 
A diver completed a dive to 24m for a duration of 42 mins with 3 
mins decompression at 5m.  At the surface he had to swim hard 
to get back to the boat.  Once onboard his legs felt weak and his 
left knee collapsed.  A little later he suffered  a vision impairment 
and had a pain in his chest.  He was given oxygen and the 
Coastguard was contacted.  The casualty was taken by 
helicopter to a recompression facility for treatment.  His condition 
was thought to have been due to a migraine attack. 
June 1999 99/187 
Two divers had completed a 26 mins dive to a depth of 36m and 
were ascending a shotline with an indicated 14 mins of 
decompression required.  At 6m they halted to start the 
decompression.  One of the pair was then hit by a falling lifting 
bag that had a 20kg load attached.  The bag had been on the 
surface for 5 mins and then failed.  As it fell the bag and load 
entangled with a delayed SMB which in turn tangled around the 
diver.  The diver was dragged down to 20 to 30m.  His buddy 
followed quickly and found the diver struggling and disorientated.  
He cut him free.  The diver had put air into his BCD and suit to 
14        ©BS-AC - 1999 

NDC Diving Incidents Report - 1999                           
try to stop his rapid descent and now made a rapid ascent to the 
surface missing all of his stops.  The buddy completed his stops.  
At the surface the buoyant diver was placed on oxygen.  He 
vomited and this showed signs of blood.  The Coastguard was 
alerted and, once all divers were recovered, they returned 
quickly to shore.  The casualty was taken by ambulance to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  He was found to have 
suffered a burst eardrum, but no long term effects. 
June 1999 99/170 
A diver completed a training dive to a maximum depth of 24m for 
a duration of 20 mins with a 3 min decompression stop.  
Immediately on surfacing he felt very tired and had difficulty 
breathing.  He was given oxygen.  He then suffered from an 
apparent minor epileptic fit.  He was taken to hospital and 
subsequently sent for recompression treatment.  This same 
individual is the subject of an earlier incident.  It was 
subsequently found that this diver has a PFO. 
June 1999 99/207 
Two divers entered the water and started their descent.  One of 
the divers was felt to be underweighted and they left the water to 
rectify this problem.  They started again and were at a depth of 
25m when the diver who had been underweight suddenly, and 
without warning, rushed back to the surface.  The buddy 
completed a normal ascent.  At the surface the distressed diver 
was recovered into another boat.  He complained of crushing 
pains in his chest and was placed on oxygen.  The Coastguard 
was alerted and the diver taken by helicopter to a recompression 
facility.  Examination of this diver showed no medical problems 
and he was released.  Subsequent analysis of his air revealed 
very slight traces of CO2 although this was not considered 
relevant.  The problem was considered to have been hypoxia as 
a result of stress induced hyperventilation. 
July 1999 99/234 
A diver experienced pain in his tooth and gum during descents.  
His solution was to make slow descents.  On one dive he 
suffered pain during the ascent and spent 8 mins at 6m in an 
attempt to ease the pain.  On surfacing the pain increased and 
spread to the whole side of his face, causing blurred vision and 
impaired speech and balance.  He was taken to hospital and 
given painkillers.  A sinus barotrauma was diagnosed.  The 
following day the diver had recovered.  Subsequent dental work 
on a root canal, indicated that the problem was due to pressure 
on a nerve because of a filling. 
July 1999 99/201 
Two divers conducted a dive on a wreck at a depth of 38m.  At 
the bottom one of the divers indicated that something was wrong 
and they ascended to 28m.  Here the distressed diver began to 
shake badly and his buddy brought him to the surface using a 
controlled buoyant lift.  They were recovered into their boat.  The 
dive duration was 12 mins.  One of their computers showed 
missed stops.  Neither diver showed any adverse symptoms.  
The distressed diver's air cylinder was later found to contain 
small particles of grit and rust. 
July 1999 99/183 
Two divers were practising assisted ascent drills from 10 to 6m.  
They lost control of the ascent, nearly came to the surface, and 
then sank back down to 14m.  One of the pair hurt his ear and 
was found to have blood coming from his nose and ear. 
July 1999 99/236 
After 18 mins at 22m a diver developed a nose bleed.  He 
returned to the surface and the nose bleed stopped after a 
further 35 mins. 
July 1999 99/185 
Two divers descended a shotline to a depth of 44m.  On the way 
down they passed two others of their group ascending the 
shotline.  One of the descending pair stopped at 34m and his 
buddy returned to him.  They exchanged OK signals.  The diver 
who had stopped then flung out his arms violently, knocking the 
regulator from the mouth of the other.  This diver replaced his 
regulator and took hold of the struggling diver.  This diver was 
breathing heavily and fast and 'clawing for the surface'.  Then he 
stopped struggling and became unresponsive.  His buddy was 
able to detect a pulse and started to fin for the surface with the 
casualty.  He sank to the bottom.  Then holding on to the 
casualty's drysuit inflator hose he dragged himself up the 
shotline with his other hand.  The pair of divers that had 
previously ascended realised that something was wrong and 
descended to help.  They met at about 25m and one of this pair 
helped the original buddy to lift the casualty to the surface.  Here 
they called for assistance from the boat and started AV.  They 
recovered the casualty into the boat and gave further AV.  He 
started to recover and was placed on oxygen.  The assisting 
diver from the other pair had missed 2 mins of decompression 
stops, the fourth diver completed his stops before surfacing.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and the boat headed for shore.  The 
casualty was airlifted to a recompression facility for 
precautionary treatment.  None of the other divers suffered any ill 
effects. 
July 1999 99/239 
Two trainees were conducting a navigation exercise in 6m water 
with their instructor.  One trainee got left behind and started to 
panic, she sank over a ledge to 8m.  Her instructor brought her 
to the surface.  She was frightened and had a bleeding sinus.  
This diver had previously conducted a dive to 18m for 30 mins 
followed by an abandoned dive to 5m because of an ear 
problem. 
July 1999 99/175 
A number of children were being given lessons in snorkel diving 
by members of a diving club.  One evening, before the session 
started, one of the children jumped from the top diving board and 
landed on one of the club members who was swimming in the 
pool.  The shoulder of the swimmer was dislocated in the 
incident, the child was unhurt.  The injured swimmer was taken 
to hospital for treatment. 
July 1999 99/345 
Following a dive to 50m a diver complained of numbness in her 
arm. Medical advice was sought, and after consultation her 
symptoms were attributed to a tight cuff seal.  (Coastguard 
report). 
August 1999 99/244 
A diver completed a dive to 8m during which she made two 
ascents to the surface conducting training drills.  On the last 
occasion she made a fast ascent during a mask clearing drill.  
Total dive duration 41 mins.  She then suffered a severe 
headache and difficulty with vision.  The diver stated that she did 
not suffer migraine and was recompressed.  The problems 
subsided and then returned.  It was concluded that she was 
suffering from migraine.  She was taken to hospital for 
observation and discharged shortly afterwards. 
August 1999 99/245 
A diver suffered an ear problem whilst diving at 7m.

August 1999 99/214 
Two divers completed a dive to 26m for a duration of 25 mins.  
The divers deployed a delayed SMB to make their ascent.  They 
experienced some difficulty as the tide had started to run.  At 
times during their ascent they partially re-descended.  Back in 
their boat one of their computers showed a missed 2 mins stop 
and the other displayed an error.  One of the divers complained 
of a tingling sensation in one of his fingers.  Both divers were 
placed on oxygen and the Coastguard alerted.  Once ashore the 
divers were taken to a recompression facility for examination.  
The diver with the tingling sensation was recompressed and 
suffered an oxygen fit during the treatment.  It was finally

Boating & Surface Incidents 
 
October 1998  99/265 
A diver who became separated from her group due to strong 
undercurrents was located some distance from the point of entry 
by a fishing vessel. Lack of detection aids was made up for by a 
high visibility stab jacket.  (Coastguard report). 
October 1998  99/389 
Lifeboat launched to assist dive boat with engine problems.  
Craft towed in.  (RNLI report). 
October 1998  99/266 
A diver became separated from their boat.  CG helicopter 
scrambled, two Lifeboats launched but diver was located by their 
own vessel shortly after.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
October 1998  99/014 
A diver was conducting a training dive, at night in a river, when 
he was swept away by the current.  Other members of the party 
called the emergency services.  He was found by a police 
helicopter using thermal imaging equipment, 90 mins later, on 
the riverbank, 4 miles downstream.  He was uninjured. 
October 1998  99/024 
A group of four divers entered the water and started down a 
shotline.  At 9m one of the group was unable to clear his ears 
and decided to abort the dive.  He indicated to his buddy that he 
should continue with the other three.  He ascended alone and on 
the way up met another four coming down.  He moved off the 
shotline to allow them past.  The shotline was pulled downwards 
and he was not able to locate it again to continue his ascent.  He 
continued to the surface.  At the surface, conditions had become 
rough and he was not spotted by the boat.  Despite trying to 
attract their attention he was swept away.  The other members of 
the group sought Coastguard assistance when they realised that 
the diver was missing and he was found and rescued by 
helicopter.  No subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
October 1998  99/268 
The SINGLE outboard of a dive RHIB would not start resulting in 
a SOLO diver being nearly a mile from the boat. The dive boat 
handler fired flares which were spotted by persons at sea and on 
shore. The diver inflated lifting bags that were sighted by the 
Coastguard Helicopter.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports).

from the boat. They were all picked up by a Lifeboat and a 
fishing vessel.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
 
 
November 1998  99/272 
Complaints were received from a fishing vessel regarding a diver 
on the surface at a harbour entrance. The vessel had to go hard 
astern to avoid hitting the diver. The local Coastguard team 
attended and gave advice to the diver!  (Coastguard report). 
November 1998  99/059 
A group of divers were testing an RHIB on a reservoir when they 
discovered a capsized dinghy.  The solo sailor had been in the 
water, unnoticed, for 45 mins.  They recovered him into the RHIB 
and took him to the shore.  They radioed ahead but, on the way, 
their own boat became swamped.  A support boat arrived and 
they were all safely brought ashore. 
November 1998  99/274 
After becoming separated, a dive buddy raised the alarm by 999.

November 1998  99/080 
Two pairs of divers anchored their boat and the first pair 
conducted their dive.  Once back in the boat the second pair 
started their dive.  The first pair felt unwell and one lay down in 
the boat.  They did not realise that the boat was drifting.  After 1 
hour and 15 mins the second pair could not be seen and the two 
in the boat started a search, but because they had been drifting 
this was in the wrong place.  The divers, meanwhile, had 
surfaced near their entry point and were holding onto a fishing 
buoy.  After 15 mins of searching, the pair in the boat called the 
Coastguard for assistance.  Two lifeboats, a spotter plane and a 
helicopter started a search.  The divers were spotted, signalling 
with their torches, by a lifeboat and recovered 30 mins before 
nightfall. 
November 1998  99/396 
Lifeboat launched to assist dive boat with engine problems.  
Craft towed in.  (RNLI report).

SMB or surface detection aids reported.  (Coastguard report). 
February 1999  99/081 
A student was at the helm of an RHIB during a boat handling 
course.  During a tight turn an instructor reduced the throttle and 
increased the tightness of the turn.  The boat then hit a large 
wave and jumped sideways.  Another student lost her balance 
and fell from the boat.  She grabbed the ropes at the side of the 
boat and was dragged a short distance before letting go.  She 
was wearing a drysuit and an automatic inflation lifejacket.  The 
boat returned to pick her up.  No ill effects resulted. 
February 1999  99/095 
Two pairs of divers commenced a dive from an RHIB.  Sea 
conditions were moderate and there was a strong current.  The 
SMBs of both pairs of divers were pulled under the surface and 
the cover boat lost contact with them.  When the divers were 
clearly overdue an attempt was made to contact the Coastguard 
using the boat's VHF radio.  It was found that the radio could 
receive but not transmit.  The boat returned to the shore and one 
of the pair onboard went ashore to phone for assistance, the cox 
returned to search.  A 4 hour search involving 3 lifeboats, 3 
Coastguard units, 2 helicopters and local fishing boats took 
place.  The divers were eventually found at the surface, one pair 
six miles and the other pair six and a half miles from their entry 
point.  Sea conditions had become very rough and nightfall was 
close.  Torches, flags and the SMBs helped the divers to be 
spotted from the air.  Two of the divers were taken to hospital for 
treatment for hypothermia. 
February 1999  99/398 
Lifeboat launched to assist dive boat with engine problems.

Two divers planned to conduct a drift dive over a wreck and then 
ascend using a delayed SMB.  They descended and discovered 
that they were not on the wreck and deeper than planned.  They 
deployed their SMB and made their ascent.  At the surface their 
boat was engaged in placing other divers into the water and they 
were not noticed.  They were unable to attract the attention of 
those in the boat and were carried away by strong currents.  The 
Coastguard was alerted when it was realised that they were 
missing.  The divers were located by a yacht and recovered by a 
helicopter after being missing for over 1 hour.

offshore. It was towed into port by the Inshore Lifeboat.  
(Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
June 1999  99/144 
Two divers descended a shotline to a wreck.  Unknown to them 
as they descended the line the buoy was dragged underwater, 
so the people in the boat lost sight of it.  When they reached the 
seabed at 25m the divers saw that the shot was dragging along 
the bottom.  They ascended and found the shot buoy at 20m.  
They attached a lifting bag to the buoy and sent it to the surface.  
They then ascended this line.  At the surface they could see their 
boat about 1 mile away, but they were not spotted by the people 
in the boat.  After the agreed dive time the boat party alerted the 
Coastguard of the missing divers.  A lifeboat and army helicopter 
commenced a search.  The divers were recovered after 1 hour 
15 mins in the water and returned to their boat.  No subsequent 
ill effects were reported. 
June 1999  99/145 
Three divers were conducting a drift dive at a depth of 17m.  The 
current was found to be stronger than expected and in the 
opposite direction.  Because of these factors the divers 
terminated the dive after only 15 mins and they launched a 
delayed SMB.  At the surface they found that they had been 
swept along the coast and out of sight of their boat.  They swam 
inshore and left the water.  One of the group walked back along 
the cliffs to where the boat was but was unable to attract their

attention.  A lifeboat was already assisting.  Eventually the diver 
who had walked back was picked up by an inshore lifeboat and 
taken back to recover the other two divers.  A swell had picked 
up and these divers were recovered with difficulty.  A helicopter 
was launched but not needed.  All divers were safely returned 
and their kit subsequently recovered by the lifeboat crew.

Four diving boats were positioned over a wreck with a number of 
divers in the water.  'A' flags were being displayed.  A fleet of 
racing yachts approached the area with the intention of using a 
nearby navigation buoy as a turning mark.  The dive boat users 
attempted to warn the yachts from the area and some turned 
away but others didn't and sailed over the diving area.  The 
Coastguard was alerted to the situation and an inshore patrol 
boat attended the scene.  No injuries were sustained.

A group of divers dived in pairs on a wreck using the shotline of 
another group.  When the last pair had descended the shot was 
recovered.  The dive marshal was in the penultimate pair to 
descend and, when he had finished his dive and dekitted, he 
checked on the status of the others with his deputy.  They 
determined that one pair were still underwater.  The boat was 
slowly underway.  They checked with the skipper and he told 
them that he was on his way back to shore.  The boat returned to 
the site to recover the last pair who, by that time, had been on 
the surface for 15 mins.

Two RHIBs with six people in one and seven in the other were 
on their way to a dive site when one of the two hit a large wave.  
This caused the bow sponson to be separated from the hull.  The

boat was swamped, the battery flooded and the engine stopped.  
The fuel tank was separated from the fuel line and became filled 
with seawater.  The second boat took off the dive equipment and 
the Coastguard was called for assistance.  Two other dive boats 
came to their assistance and they took divers onboard and the 
damaged boat in tow.  They were joined by a police launch, a 
lifeboat and a helicopter.  The lifeboat took divers onboard and 
the damaged boat in tow.  On the way back the second boat 
developed a malfunction and was also taken in tow.  Both boats 
and all divers were returned safely to the shore. 
August 1999  99/222 
Two divers booked places on a charter dive RHIB.  They 
planned a site with a maximum depth of 25m, and gave this 
information to the cox.  On the way to the site, with a total of six 
divers onboard, the boat seemed overloaded, had a leak, and 
became partially flooded with water.   The two divers 
commenced their dive but, at 34m, they still could not see the 
seabed.  They aborted the dive.  At the surface they could see 
the boat but were not recovered since the engines of the boat 
would not start.  These divers were swept into a tidal race with 
rough sea conditions.  The cox attempted to radio for assistance 
and then fired a red flare.  Two lifeboats, other vessels and a 
visiting warship went to assist.  The other four divers also 
returned to the surface, two of them having reached 48m without 
seeing the seabed.     A helicopter recovered these four divers 
and then returned to rescue the cox.  One of the rescued divers 
informed the helicopter crew that two were still missing.  The last 
pair was also recovered, but were required to abandon their kit, 
prior to rescue, due to the poor sea conditions.  Their diving 
equipment was recovered 24 hours later by a fishing boat.  A 
lifeboat recovered the RHIB. 
August 1999  99/367 
A dive RHIB with 5 POB broke down and was towed to port by 
RNLI inshore lifeboat.  (Coastguard report). 
August 1999  99/366 
A 24m drift dive in a strong tide equalled 2 lost divers. A 
helicopter and lifeboat were tasked to search, but both divers 
were located safe by their own RHIB, having been swept further 
than expected. SMBs would have helped!  (Coastguard report). 
September 1999  99/375 
A clear contravention of the Collision Regulations resulted in a 
complaint being made against a RHIB passing through a dive 
site at speed despite an 'A' flag being flown. Classed as 
dangerous practice.  (Coastguard report). 
September 1999  99/377 
An early morning dive with divers surfacing in thick fog led a 
member of the public to hear shouting and whistles from 
seaward. A Coastguard response team and RNLI inshore 
lifeboat found divers lost on the surface attracting attention with 
air horns. The divers were all recovered. Noise is a good surface 
detection aid in thick fog. A busy morning with unexpected 
incidents for Tyne Tees Coastguard.  (Coastguard report). 
September 1999  99/376 
A broken down diving RHIB was towed into port by another 
RHIB.  (Coastguard report). 
September 1999  99/378 
Two divers were reported lost following a drift dive. A helicopter, 
lifeboat and Coastguards were tasked to search. The divers 
were located safe by their parent boat just as rescuers arrived on 
scene.  (Coastguard report). 
September 1999  99/258 
A diver's knife became unsheathed during a return journey from 
a dive site and punctured the side tube of an RHIB.  The boat 
was safely berthed. 
September 1999  99/256 
The engine of a dive boat cut out as it left harbour.  It was 
restarted but cut out again when put in gear.  There was an 
offshore wind and so the boat's anchor was deployed.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and a lifeboat, which had been on 
exercise, towed the boat back to the shore. 
September 1999  99/379 
Two divers were reported overdue from a dive at St Kilda. 
Stornoway lifeboat, Coastguard helicopter and other vessels in 
the area were tasked to search. Both divers were located safe 
some 40 mins later by their own boat.  (Coastguard report). 
September 1999  99/381 
The cox of a dive RHIB went ashore to use a mobile phone to 
report 8 missing divers, lost on a drift dive off a notorious 
headland. All the divers were picked up by a motor-sailing vessel 
on passage. Perhaps a VHF on board would have been prudent!  
(Coastguard report). 
September 1999  99/383 
A RHIB suffered engine failure and was towed in by Lifeboat.  
(Coastguard report). 
September 1999  99/384 
A dive vessel with 3 POB suffered engine failure and was towed 
into port by RNLI lifeboat.  (Coastguard report). 
September 1999  99/387 
A dive RHIB with 6 POB suffered engine failure and was towed 
to harbour by another vessel.  (Coastguard report). 
September 1999  99/386 
A dive RHIB with 8 POB suffered engine failure and was towed 
to safety by a rescue boat.  (Coastguard report). 
September 1999  99/388 
A dive vessel with 6 POB suffered engine failure. It was towed to 
port by a RNLI inshore lifeboat.  (Coastguard report).

Ascents 
 
October 1998 99/267 
A 62 year old novice diver unfamiliar with mask clearance and 
buoyancy control made an uncontrolled ascent from 20m and 
lost consciousness at 6m. He was brought ashore and CPR 
commenced (weak pulse) with 100% O2. Ambulance then took 
casualty (conscious) for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
December 1998 99/064 
After a 19 min dive to a maximum depth of 35m a diver lost 
control of her buoyancy and made a rapid ascent from 3m 
missing decompression stops.  No ill effects were noted. 
January 1999 99/062 
A trainee diver completed a dive 8m for 47 mins.  2 hours later 
this diver dived again to 17m.  18 mins into the dive he and two 
companions started a slow ascent up a rock wall.  At 14m he 
lost a fin, and then the second fin.  He became disorientated 
and made a fast ascent to the surface.  Towards the end of the 
ascent his regulator was pulled from his mouth.  At the surface 
assistance was summoned and he was helped from the water.  
He was given oxygen and taken to hospital for examination.  
The only ill effect reported was a pain in his knuckles 15 hours 
later which passed after a further 2 hours. 
January 1999 99/075 
A diver was using a hired drysuit in which the boots were too 
large.  19 mins into a dive at 31m her feet came out of the 
boots and she panicked.  She made a fast ascent to the 
surface.  Her buddy surfaced normally.  No subsequent ill 
effects were reported. 
February 1999 99/097 
Two trainees dived together to a depth of 32m.  After 8 mins a 
fast ascent was made and planned stops were missed.  No 
problems were noted at the time. 
February 1999 99/098 
Two divers had been to a maximum depth of 32m.  At 20m one 
lost control of her buoyancy and made a fast ascent to the 
surface missing a planned safety stop.  Total dive duration 21 
mins.  No ill effects were noted. 
February 1999 99/109 
A group of divers were delayed in their journey to a wreck and 
the entry into the water was rushed.  One pair dived to 33m 
and, 10 mins into the dive, the computer of one showed 1 min 
of no stop time remaining.  He showed his buddy but little 
attention was paid.  Later he asked to see the buddy's contents 
gauge.  It showed 70 bar, the level at which they had previously 
agreed to ascend.  He indicated the ascent, but the buddy 
swam on.  He insisted and the ascent started.  At 6m the diver 
prepared a delayed SMB, he handed the weight to the buddy 
and filled and released the buoy.  As it ascended it caught on 
his torch; this was quickly released.  The buddy however was 
holding the SMB line and started to be pulled upwards.  He 
dumped air and started to descend quickly.  He put air back into 
his jacket and was carried to the surface.  The divers were 
recovered into the boat and their computers indicated missed 
stops.  The diver who had done the buoyant ascent was given 
the single oxygen supply and the other placed on nitrox 33.  
They were taken ashore.  Once ashore both were placed on 
oxygen and taken to hospital.  Advice was sought and they 
were airlifted to a recompression facility where they received 
precautionary recompression treatment.  It is believed that 
narcosis had affected one of the divers.  No subsequent ill 
effects were reported. 
February 1999 99/279 
A novice diver, who had a history of back pain, dived to 9.4m 
and had a panic attack. He made a rapid ascent and was 
airlifted to Poole Hyperbaric unit with his buddy.  (Coastguard 
report). 
February 1999 99/099 
After 16 mins at a maximum depth of 14m one of a pair of 
divers lost control of his buoyancy and made a fast ascent to 
the surface.  No subsequent ill effects were noted. 
February 1999 99/093 
Two trainees and an instructor were making their way back up 
from a 20m dive and planned to complete a practice controlled 
buoyant lift.  They were about 14 mins into the dive when the 
instructor's attention was distracted by a shoal of fish.  He 
turned to point them out to one of the trainees but he was not to 
be seen.  The instructor and the other trainee conducted a 
search around them and then made a normal ascent to the 
surface.  There they found the third diver, who had made a 
rapid ascent.  This diver was monitored for signs of DCI.  No ill 
effects were reported. 
March 1999 99/089 
Two divers were conducting a dive at a depth of 12m.  After 
about 12 mins one of them felt a click around her waist.  She 
looked to find out what had happened and her weightbelt 
slipped off.  She was not able to grab it and made a buoyant 
ascent to the surface.  At the surface she was assisted by other 
divers to leave the water.  No subsequent ill effects were 
experienced.  It was thought that the weightbelt slid round and 
the buckle released itself against her cylinder. 
March 1999 99/102 
Three divers were at 5m after a dive to 36m for 24 mins.  One 
of the divers lost control of his buoyancy and made a fast 
ascent to the surface missing a planned safety stop. 
March 1999 99/106 
A trainee and an instructor were at a depth of 6m when, despite 
having air in his cylinder, the trainee gave the 'out of air' signal 
and spat out his regulator.  The instructor provided her 
alternative air source and they started an ascent.  At 4m the 
trainee panicked, spat out the regulator again, inflated his 
drysuit and rushed to the surface.  At the surface he complained 
of shortness of breath and severe chest pain.  He was towed 
ashore, oxygen was given and an ambulance called.  A 
helicopter was then called and the diver and instructor were 
flown to a recompression facility.  By this time the trainee had 
recovered.  No recompression treatment was given, and he was 
released after some hours of observation.  It was subsequently 
discovered that, despite a current medical, the trainee suffered 
from asthma, and had been suffering stomach pains and 
diarrhoea for the previous month. 
March 1999 99/119 
Two divers were 7 mins into a dive at a depth of 22m when the 
©BSAC - 1999   23 

  NDC Diving Incidents Report - 1999 
air inlet valve to one of the divers' drysuits stuck in the open 
position.  He made an uncontrolled ascent to 6m where he was 
able to regain control by venting from his neck seal.  The valve 
was subsequently found to be corroded.  No subsequent ill 
effects were reported. 
April 1999 99/116 
Three divers were at a depth of 16m.  6 mins into the dive the 
weightbelt release of one of the divers was snagged on a rock 
and released.  The diver, who was wearing a wetsuit, made a 
buoyant ascent.  He breathed out and attempted to slow the 
ascent but was carried to the surface.  The other two followed 
making a normal ascent.  No subsequent ill effects were 
experienced. 
April 1999 99/202 
Two divers completed a dive to 28m and started their ascent 
after 22 mins.  During the ascent one of the divers was unable 
to control his buoyancy and ascended directly to the surface 
missing a 1 min stop.  He was recovered into the boat and 
placed on oxygen.  He showed no ill effects.  The other diver 
completed a normal ascent.  The buoyant diver had previously 
removed weights from his belt believing that he had previously 
been too heavy. 
April 1999 99/133 
Two trainees and an instructor were at a depth of 20m when 
one of the trainees started to become buoyant.  The other 
trainee tried to assist and they began to ascend rapidly.  The air 
feed to the buoyant diver's drysuit had stuck in the 'inflate' 
position.  The other trainee pulled the hose from the valve, but 
they were still carried to the surface.  The buoyant diver was 
inverted during part of this ascent.  No subsequent ill effects 
were reported. 
April 1999 99/204 
Two divers had been to 34m and were ascending up an 
underwater slope.  At 26m one of the divers was unable to 
release air from his drysuit and made a buoyant ascent to the 
surface, his buddy completed a normal ascent with stops.  At 
the surface, the buoyant diver's computer indicated 3 mins 
missed decompression.  The Coastguard was contacted and 
medical advice sought.  The diver was taken by boat to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  No symptoms were 
experienced at any time.  The diver was diving in a new suit and 
was not familiar with its shoulder dump valve. 
April 1999 99/289 
Two divers made a fast ascent, one showed slight DCI 
symptoms. Both were lifted by helo to Poole decompression 
unit where assessment showed that no treatment was 
necessary there. Both divers taken to a general hospital.  
(Coastguard report). 
April 1999 99/293 
Two divers lost buoyancy at 8m following a 40m dive. They 
made a fast ascent. Oxygen given and they were met at port by 
a diving doctor who pronounced them fit and well. Lucky 
escape.  (Coastguard report). 
April 1999 99/115 
An instructor commenced a dive with two trainees.  5 mins into 
the dive, at a depth of 9m, one of the trainees signalled a 
problem with his ears and the instructor indicated that he should 
hold onto the SMB line and move up a little, which they did.  
The trainee then spat out his regulator, the instructor replaced it 
but he spat it out again and commenced to use his octopus 
regulator.  The instructor turned to look at the other trainee at 
which point the first trainee rushed to the surface.   The 
instructor and other trainee followed.  At the surface he was in 
some distress and was towed to the shore.  He showed no 
signs of injury and reported that he had lost his regulator and 
rushed to the surface. 
April 1999 99/296 
Two divers reported missing stops after a 30m dive. No 
symptoms reported. Situation monitored and fortunately DCI did 
not manifest itself.  (Coastguard report). 
May 1999 99/132 
Three divers descended a shotline to a wreck at a depth of 
20m.  They had to struggle against a current.  One of the divers' 
octopus regulator began to free flow.  Shortly afterwards his 
main regulator also started to free flow.  He made a fast ascent 
to the surface, breathing from his main regulator and allowing 
the excess air to escape from his mouth.  His dive computer 
registered a fast ascent and locked for 24 hours.  No 
subsequent ill effects were reported. 
May 1999 99/228 
A diver breathing nitrox 32 dived to a maximum depth of 28m.  
At 18m he prepared to deploy a delayed SMB.  He passed the 
buoy to his buddy and held on to the reel.  His buddy put air into 
the buoy and released it.  The line snagged on the diver with 
the reel and started to pull him to the surface.  He was unable to 
free himself and had no knife to cut the lined.  He was pulled to 
the surface.  Total dive time 30 mins.  His buddy made a normal 
ascent.  At the surface the diver was placed on oxygen and 
taken ashore.  Medical advice was sought.  No ill effects were 
experienced and no other treatment given. 
May 1999 99/298 
A diver made a rapid ascent from 24.7m after she had lost her 
weightbelt. Medical advice was obtained and she was advised 
not to dive again that day.  (Coastguard report). 
May 1999 99/123 
Two diver were 14 mins into a dive at a depth of 20m.  Their 
maximum depth had been 25m.  One of the pair lost control of 
her buoyancy and made a fast ascent.  She was unable to 
dump air fast enough from her drysuit dump valve.   Her 
undersuit had a showerproof outer surface and it is thought that 
this inhibited air release from the suit.  No subsequent ill effects 
were reported. 
May 1999 99/205 
Two divers descended a shotline to the seabed at a depth of 
42m.  The shot was not on the wreck and they attempted to 
navigate to it.  One of the divers had a problem with a fin and 
attempted to correct it.  In doing so they became separated and 
the diver became inverted.  He was unable to right himself and, 
believing that he was being carried towards the surface, took 
out his knife to release air from his suit.  At this point his buddy 
returned and helped to right him.  The divers started towards 
the surface and made a fast ascent from 6m because of loss of 
buoyancy control.  At the surface their computers recorded a 
fast ascent.  The diver who had been inverted developed a 
tingling in his fingers and a pain in his calf muscles.  He was 
placed on oxygen and these symptoms were resolved. 
May 1999 99/300 
Two divers missed a 3 min decompression stop. They were 
taken to hospital by ambulance for precautionary observations.  
(Coastguard report).

May 1999 99/149 
A trainee and an instructor completed a dive to a maximum 
depth of 18m.  After 14 mins the trainee became tired and 
confused.  He started to ascend normally but at 4m he lost 
control and made a fast ascent.  His weightbelt was released at 
the surface.  No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
May 1999 99/206 
Two divers conducted a dive to 32m.  After 30 mins they started 
their ascent.  At 8m one of the divers lost control of his 
buoyancy and ascended directly to the surface.  The other diver 
completed 20 mins stops at 4m.  A search was initiated for the 
second diver and the Coastguard was alerted that he was 
missing.  When he surfaced it was realised that the first diver 
had missed stops.  He was placed on oxygen and taken ashore 
by lifeboat.  He was taken to hospital and released later that 
day.  No symptoms were experienced by either diver. 
May 1999 99/162 
After 28 mins into a dive to 19m a pair of divers prepared to 
ascend.  One of the pair attached a lifting bag to their boat's 
anchor and the other moved away to wait.  This diver was then 
suddenly unable to breathe from his regulator.  He looked at his 
contents gauge and it read zero.  He made a fast ascent to the 
surface and was recovered into the boat.  He was placed on 
oxygen and monitored for problems.  The buddy was also 
recovered into the boat.  They contacted the Coastguard, and 
were escorted back to shore by a lifeboat.  The diver was given 
a medical examination and found to be free of problems. 
May 1999 99/142 
Two divers were 13 mins into a dive at a depth of 28m, they 
ascended to 18m then redescended to 22m to observe a 
crayfish under a ledge.  At this point the direct feed actuation 
valve to the drysuit of one of the divers was pressed against the 
rocks and the suit became inflated.  This diver was carried 
buoyantly to 3m.  He finished his ascent and was recovered into 
the boat and placed on oxygen.  The other diver discovered his 
buddy was missing and made a normal ascent.  The 
Coastguard was advised.  Subsequent medical examination did 
not reveal any DCI problem. 
May 1999 99/241 
Two divers completed a drift dive to 27m for 20 mins.  As they 
prepared to ascend one of the pair found that his drysuit dump 
valve was dumping air uncontrollably.  He used his BCD to 
make the ascent.  At 22m the ascent rate increased and he 
found that he was unable to dump air from his drysuit.  The last 
7m of the ascent was rapid.  His buddy made a normal ascent 
and completed a safety stop before surfacing.  The buoyant 
diver was placed on oxygen.  No subsequent ill effects were 
reported. 
May 1999 99/315 
A fast ascent from 10 and 15m by two trainee divers led to 
oxygen administration and overnight observation. Both divers 
showed no ill effects.  (Coastguard report). 
May 1999 99/152 
Two divers entered the water and descended a shotline to the 
top of a rock at a depth of 25m.  They descended a rock wall to 
a maximum depth of 51m.  One of the pair appeared ill at ease 
and they returned to the top of the rock.  They deployed a 
delayed SMB and began to ascend.  The diver who had been ill 
at ease struggled to control his buoyancy and to operate the 
SMB reel.  At 8m this diver ran out of air and his buddy gave 
him his spare regulator.  The first diver, still struggling, then 
became inverted and tangled in the SMB line.  Both divers were 
carried to the surface missing 16 mins of decompression stops.  
At the surface they were safely recovered into the boat and 
spent over 1 hour breathing oxygen and 80% nitrox.  No 
symptoms of DCI were experienced. 
July 1999 99/331 
A diver lost his weightbelt at 10m and made a rapid ascent. He 
was taken to hospital by ambulance as a precaution.  
(Coastguard report). 
July 1999 99/182 
10 mins into a dive, at a depth of 21m, one of a pair of divers 
started to hyperventilate.  Her buddy realised that there was a 
problem and brought them to the surface.  They made a fast 
ascent but apparently suffered no ill effects. 
July 1999 99/235 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 22m for a 
duration of 34 mins.  During the ascent he lost control at 16m 
and made a slightly fast ascent.  His computer indicated a 
violation of ascent rate.  Afterwards he noticed a numbness of 
the right side of his face and swollen hands.  The condition was 
monitored and he was symptom free after one hour. 
September 1999 99/370 
Shouts for help from seaward were investigated by 
Coastguards. On arrival they found that a diver, on her first 
night dive, had panicked and made a rapid ascent. Apart from a 
headache, she was none the worse for wear.  (Coastguard 
report). 
September 1999 99/372 
Medical advice was sought after a diver became anxious after 
missing 8 mins of stops during a 32m dive for 23 mins on 22% 
nitrox. He was told not to dive anymore that day.  (Coastguard 
report). 
September 1999 99/259 
A diver was at a depth of 22m and was too heavy.  She ditched 
her weightbelt and made an uncontrolled ascent to the surface.  
The dive time was 23 mins.  No ill effects were experienced. 
 
 
 
 

  NDC Diving Incidents Report - 1999 
Technique 
 
October 1998 99/035 
At a depth of 16m a diver felt that he had run out of air and 
started to panic to the surface.  His buddy held his regulator in 
his mouth, pushed the purge button, and controlled their ascent.  
No subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
October 1998 99/036 
5 mins into a dive, at 20m, a diver's mask flooded and she 
started to inhale water.  She panicked and made a fast ascent to 
the surface.  It was subsequently found that an upgrade to her 
regulator exhaust valve had not been conducted and that there 
was sand in the second stage.  The diver experienced no 
subsequent ill effects. 
October 1998 99/038 
A diver was 30 mins into a dive with a maximum depth of 20m.  
At 15m he suddenly felt that he couldn't breathe out properly.  As 
he ascended the feeling became worse.  He made a rapid 
ascent to the surface.  No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
December 1998 99/087 
A diver experienced difficulty getting air from her regulator at a 
depth of 20m, her buddy shared his air and they made a safe 
return to the surface.  (Newspaper report only) 
December 1998 99/069 
Two divers planned to dive to 20m.  One diver was using a full 
face mask and had difficulty equalising his ears.  The other diver 
swam on and by the time the first caught the second they were at 
35m.  The leading diver then experienced a regulator free flow 
and started to panic.  The second diver offered his alternative air 
source.  The diver with the free flow started to ascend and 
dislodged the other's full face mask causing it to flood.  The diver 
with the free flow then sank back down and his buddy, still with a 
flooded mask, went after him, found him and managed to get him 
to the surface.  At the surface he was not breathing and had no 
heart beat.  Resuscitation attempts were made and the diver 
quickly recovered.  He was taken to hospital and discharged 
himself after 3 hours.  No subsequent ill effects are reported. 
February 1999 99/077 
A diver was at a depth of 20m, 10 mins into a dive, when she 
became distressed and switched to her octopus regulator.  This 
regulator was inserted into her mouth upside down and could not 
be cleared of water.  Her buddy offered his octopus regulator but 
this was refused.  The diver then lost consciousness.  Her buddy 
brought her to the surface using a controlled buoyant lift.  At the 
surface assistance was summoned and with the buddy giving AV 
at the surface their boat came over to them.  The casualty was 
recovered into the boat.  She had a pulse but was not breathing.  
AV was continued whilst the casualty was taken ashore.  Once 
ashore she was found to be breathing and oxygen was given.  
The casualty was taken by ambulance to hospital, where she 
remained for four days.  A good recovery was anticipated. 
April 1999 99/113 
A diver commenced his first open water dive with an instructor.  
At a depth of 2m the trainee panicked and returned to the 
surface.  Here he removed his mask and regulator.  He 
continued to panic complaining that he couldn't breathe.  He was 
helped ashore and provided with warm clothing.  He recovered 
but later took himself to hospital for a check up.  No problems 
were found.  It is felt that a tight wetsuit and the effects of cold 
water may have caused his concern. 
April 1999 99/121 
Two pairs of divers were diving together at a depth of 20m.  12 
mins into the dive one of the divers swam ahead of the others 
and became separated.  The other three surfaced and raised the 
alarm.  After several minutes the lost diver had not surfaced and 
no bubbles could be seen from where he had been.  An 
underwater search was initiated.  After a total of 34 mins the lost 
diver surfaced.  He had tried to find the others, became 
disorientated and ran into decompression stops.  No subsequent 
ill effects were reported. 
May 1999 99/130 
A diver entered the water with a new pony cylinder set up.  The 
cylinder contained nitrox 50.  At the surface he removed the 
regulator from his mouth.  As he started his dive he placed the 
pony cylinder regulator in his mouth by mistake.  When he 
reached 27m he realised that his gas supply was getting low.  He 
and his buddy aborted the dive and they made a safe ascent. 
May 1999 99/146 
A boat deployed four pairs of divers and they were covered by 
this and another boat.  One diver surfaced after about 10 mins 
having become separated from his buddy, the buddy surfaced 
shortly after.  They were reunited and they continued their dive.  
The dive depth was 10m.  10 mins later the diver surfaced again, 
having once more become separated underwater.  His buddy did 
not surface and the first diver was recovered into the boat.  A 
search was conducted for the lost diver and a set of 'solo' 
bubbles were spotted.  The buddy commenced to kit up to go to 
investigate but the bubbles were lost.  Other divers finished their 
dives and were recovered.  20 mins after the second separation 
the second diver surfaced and was recovered into the boat.  It is 
reported that this diver had continued diving solo after a previous 
underwater separation. 
May 1999 99/171 
Three divers conducted a dive to 44m.  On reaching the bottom 
the dive leader conducted an air check.  After 16 mins they 
began their ascent.  During the ascent one of the divers realised 
that his air supply was low.  At 10m their computers indicated 8 
mins decompression at 3m.  At this point the diver's air supply 
ran out.  He signalled to one of his buddies, who had a twinset 
and twin regulators, but the buddy refused to provide him with air 
and signalled that he should ascend to the surface.  The other 
buddy was below and unable to offer his pony regulator before 
the diver without air swam to the surface.  This diver made a 
rapid, free ascent from 10m and, as a result, his computer 
indicated a total of 21 mins missed decompression stops.  At the 
surface this diver was recovered into his boat and given oxygen.  
He showed no symptoms of DCI and no further assistance was 
sought. 
May 1999 99/159 
20 mins into a dive to 21m a diver ran out of air and made a fast 
ascent to the surface.  No subsequent ill effects were 
experienced. 
June 1999 99/153 
Two divers commenced a wreck dive to a planned maximum 
depth of 30m.  They intended a no stop dive of a maximum 
duration of 20 mins.  At the bottom of the shot they were at 31m.  
During the dive the current increased and they struggled to 
26  ©BS-AC - 1999 

NDC Diving Incidents Report - 1999                           
return to the shotline for their ascent, this took more time and air 
than anticipated.  They made a slow ascent and arrived at 6m 
after a total time of 32 mins.  They carried out 4 mins of 
decompression and then surfaced with low air.  The stops 
required for this dive were stated as 1 min at 9m and 6 mins at 
6m.  Both divers were monitored for symptoms of DCI but none 
were experienced. 
June 1999 99/190 
Two divers completed a dive to a maximum depth of 27m and 
ascended a shotline to a depth of 6m.  As they started the 
ascent, one of the pair had 40 bar remaining in his air cylinder.  
At 6m this diver ran out of air, attempted to breathe from an 
alternative air source that was also connected to the empty 
cylinder, and started to panic.  His buddy realised the problem 
and gave him her octopus regulator.  They let go of the shotline 
and started to sink down.  They made a safe ascent to the 
surface and were recovered into their boat.  No subsequent ill 
effects were experienced. 
July 1999 99/208 
Two divers completed a dive to 15m for 24 mins.  At this point 
one of the divers apparently ran out of air and switched to her 
pony cylinder.  They completed a normal ascent including a 
safety stop at 6m.  At the surface the diver who was out of air 
struggled to stay at the surface since she was unable to put air 
into her BCD.  She was assisted by her buddy.  Back in the boat 
she was breathless and had pains in her calf muscles.  She was 
placed on oxygen and taken by helicopter to hospital.  No signs 
of DCI were present; the muscle pain was diagnosed as cramp.  
It was subsequently found that her cylinder still contained 130 
bar, but was not fully turned on.  She had been distracted whilst 
preparing for the dive and it was not discovered during the pre-
dive check. 
July 1999 99/200 
Two divers completed a dive to 32m.  They started their ascent 
after 29 mins and completed 3 mins stops at 6m and 8 mins 
stops at 3m.  One diver, whose computer had cleared, indicated 
that they should ascend, and the other diver agreed.  1 hour after 
surfacing the second diver's computer was found to be indicating 
missed stops.  Both divers had surfaced with only 10 bar 
remaining in their cylinders (12l).  The diver with missed stops 
was monitored for problems but none were observed. 
July 1999 99/262 
Two divers conducted a wreck dive to a depth of 35m.  One 
warned the other about problems with their dive computer, and 
they agreed to follow the second diver's computer if it should 
become a problem.  They did not find the shotline and started a 
slow ascent with 80 and 100 bar respectively in their cylinders.  
By the time they reached 9m one of the divers' computer had 
cleared but the one with which problems had been experienced 
showed 7 mins decompression required.  They deployed a 
delayed SMB and at 6m one of the pair ran out of air.  The other 
diver had 50 bar and they shared air at 3m.  They finally ran out 
of air and surfaced with 1 min decompression still remaining.  No 
subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
July 1999 99/242 
Two divers conducted a dive to 20m.  After 23 mins one diver 
checked the other's air.  This diver gave the out of air signal and 
made a rapid ascent to the surface.  He was given oxygen.  No 
subsequent ill effects are reported. 
August 1999 99/211 
Two divers completed a dive to 27m.  After 22 mins one of the 
pair attempted to deploy a delayed SMB.  This failed because it 
had a puncture.  The other diver then deployed her SMB.  By this 
time they had run into decompression stops.  The divers 
ascended.  As they did so the line from the SMB fouled the 
stationary prop of their boat and the boat began to pull on the 
line.  By the time the divers were at 7m 50m of line was reeled 
out.  The diver with the reel conducted stops at 7m with her 
buddy at 5m.  The diver at 5m completed her stops, the one at 
7m had 2 mins remaining.  The SMB line was then cut by the 
propeller and the diver reeled it in.  The computer of the diver at 
7m cleared and they started to ascend.  It then again showed 2 
mins decompression so she halted the ascent, the other diver 
arrived at the surface and signalled an emergency since she had 
become separated from her buddy.  The other diver surfaced 
safely soon afterwards.

Equipment 
 
October 1998 99/013 
At the end of a training dive, at a depth of 6m, a trainee's 
regulator started to free flow.  The instructor passed the trainee 
his octopus regulator and brought the trainee to the surface 
using a controlled buoyant lift.  The regulator continued to free 
flow. 
November 1998 99/039 
6 mins into a dive, at a depth of 15m, a diver found herself 
starting to rise to the surface.  She was unable to control her 
buoyancy and rose rapidly to the surface.  The inflation valve of 
her drysuit was subsequently found to have stuck in, allowing 
air to flow continuously into the suit.  No subsequent ill effects 
were reported. 
November 1998 99/050 
Two divers descended a shotline to the seabed at a depth of 
31m.  Underwater visibility was very low.  At the bottom, the 
regulator of one of the divers let in seawater, which caused him 
to panic.  He was connected to his buddy by a line and the 
buddy also had an SMB.  The panicked diver made for the 
surface dragging the other with him.  The buddy caught up and 
managed to control the panicking diver at 23m.  They made a 
controlled ascent to 6m and conducted a 3 mins stop.  No 
subsequent ill effects were reported. 
November 1998 99/052 
Four pairs of divers descended a shotline to a depth of 40m in a 
quarry.  One pair became temporarily separated during the 
descent due to one stopping to adjust his weightbelt.  The 
buddy of this diver suffered a regulator free flow as soon as he 
arrived at the bottom.  One of the other divers gave him his 
alternative air source and a controlled ascent was made.  The 
divers conducted  4 mins of stops.  No subsequent ill effects 
were experienced. 
December 1998 99/060 
Two divers involved in pool training noticed a smell similar to 
cellulose paint thinners in their diving air.  Other cylinders were 
found to be similarly contaminated.  The air was released and 
the cylinders refilled.  During this process the refilling air bank 
also became contaminated.  Refilling all associated cylinders 
reduced the problem, but a taint was still present. 
December 1998 99/061 
16 mins into a night dive, at a depth of 23m a diver entered an 
underwater structure in a quarry.  The BCD direct feed hose of 
this diver became snagged on a hook inside this structure and 
she was unable to exit.  Her buddy entered and was able to free 
her.  The divers made a safe return to the surface. 
March 1999 99/101 
A diver was testing a new equipment configuration in shallow 
water.  Prior to the dive, during a kit check, the feed supply to 
his BCD was inadvertently turned off.  Underwater he had a 
problem with a full face mask, and was just able to get his 
alternative air source into his mouth before losing 
consciousness.  He had been unable to make himself buoyant.  
He was recovered to the surface by his buddy and another diver 
and made a full recovery. 
March 1999 99/092 
Two divers were filling a lifting bag to raise a shot weight.  One 
diver used the octopus regulator of the other.  On completion 
the diver was replacing her octopus regulator into its clip when 
she accidentally pressed the purge and started a free flow.  This 
could not be stopped and, breathing from the octopus regulator 
of her buddy, they made a safe controlled ascent.  No 
subsequent ill effects were reported. 
March 1999 99/103 
10 mins into a dive to 36m a diver's cylinder became loose.  Her 
buddy tried to fix the problem but couldn't, so they decided to 
ascend.  At this point the buddy's regulator started to free flow.  
They used the first diver's alternative air source and made a 
faster than normal ascent to the surface.  No subsequent ill 
effects were reported. 
March 1999 99/108 
A diver was on a training course at a depth of 20m.  10 mins 
into the dive his regulator started to free flow.  Another diver 
provided an alternative air source.  The first diver was still in 
difficulties and the instructor took control of the ascent.  At the 
surface the diver was found to be in shock and distressed.  He 
was given a medical check and found to have low blood 
pressure and an irregular heart beat (a known prior condition).  
He was taken to hospital but discharged the same day after a 
period of observation. 
April 1999 99/114 
Three divers were conducting a dive to 35m.  14 mins into the 
dive they commenced a slow ascent.  At this point the regulator 
of one began a slow free flow.  This diver switched to his 
octopus regulator.  One of his buddies took hold of this diver 
and they started to ascend.  The regulator was now fully free 
flowing.  During the ascent the first diver's main cylinder 
became fully depleted and he switched to his pony cylinder.  At 
12m they got a fast ascent warning from one of their computers 
and they both dumped air.  They lost too much buoyancy and 
returned to 20m before they realised.  The buddy inflated his 
BCD but the other diver was unable to do so because he had 
no air remaining in his main cylinder.  The buddy fully inflated 
his BCD and struggled to hold on to the heavy diver.  Slowly 
they ascended again and reached the surface.  The third diver 
stayed with the other two throughout.  No subsequent ill effects 
were experienced. 
May 1999 99/189 
At a depth of 36m a diver switched to his pony cylinder 
regulator and used his main regulator to blow some air into a 
pipe found on the bottom.  When he released the purge button 
the regulator continued to free flow.  He and his buddy made a 
safe ascent to the surface. 
May 1999 99/156 
Two divers were at a depth of 25m when the regulator of one of 
the pair began to free flow.  The octopus regulator of the other 
diver was then used but this also started to free flow.  The 
divers ascended to the surface.  The final part of the ascent 
was quick.  No subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
 
 
May 1999 99/158 
Three divers were at a depth of 34m when, after 10 mins, one 
28  ©BS-AC - 1999 

NDC Diving Incidents Report - 1999                           
of their regulators began to free flow.  This diver used the 
alternative air source of one of the others and they made their 
ascent.  The ascent became fast from 20m and they missed a 
planned safety stop.  No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
May 1999 99/163 
Two divers were 10 mins into a dive at a depth of 22m.  One of 
the pair noticed a restriction to inhalation through his regulator.  
The next breath was even more restricted and on the third he 
was not able to get any air.  He approached his buddy and they 
made an air shared ascent.  Inspection at the surface showed 
that his air cylinder still contained 160 bar.  When tested the 
regulator fluctuated between no air and free flow. 
June 1999 99/231 
Two pairs of divers were conducting a dive, each covered by a 
boat.  Both pairs were using SMBs.  One SMB moved away 
from the intended dive area and one of the boats followed it.  
The first boat stayed in the dive area and was recovering the 
first pair when they heard shouts nearby.  They discovered that 
it was the second pair of divers.  All divers were safely 
recovered, and it was found that the SMB of the second pair 
had become detached from the line because of an eyelet 
failure.  The second boat had been following the drifting SMB, 
not realising that it had become detached. 
July 1999 99/209 
At the beginning of a dive, at a depth of 6m, a diver's regulator 
hose burst at the junction with the first stage.  He made a rapid, 
controlled ascent to the surface, breathing from this regulator.  
No ill effects were reported. 
July 1999 99/179 
Two divers conducted a dive to 11m.  A few minutes into the 
dive, one of the pair looked at his contents gauge which was 
mounted in a console and noticed that the high pressure hose 
was kinked at a right angle.  As he moved the hose it suddenly 
burst allowing air to escape violently.  The two started an ascent 
and half way to the surface he took the alternative air source 
from his buddy as his own regulator was becoming hard to 
breathe from.  They arrived safely at the surface, with a total 
dive time of 5 mins.  The 10.4l cylinder had started at 215 bar 
and finished with 50 bar. 
July 1999 99/180 
An instructor and two trainees were descending a shotline to a 
wreck.  At 4m they stopped while one of the trainees cleared his 
ears.  At this point the weightbelt fell away from this diver.  The 
instructor grabbed hold of the trainee and held him to the 
shotline.  They then made a controlled ascent to the surface.  
The weightbelt was subsequently recovered and it was found 
that the belt had come undone from the buckle, the buckle was 
still correctly fastened to the clip at the other end of the belt. 
August 1999 99/357 
A solo shore diver panicked and made a rapid ascent when his 
suit became very uncomfortable. He was assisted to the shore 
by another group of divers. An ambulance was called, but the 
symptoms disappeared when the ill fitting drysuit was removed. 
It beggars belief!  (Coastguard report).

Overseas Incidents 
 
Fatalities 
 
January 1999  99/063 
Two pairs of divers descended to a depth of 37m to enter a 
large wreck.  One diver became separated from her buddy and 
surfaced alone, the other three continued together.  After a total 
submerged time of 22 mins one of the three surfaced and was 
seen to be in trouble.  Another dive boat recovered this diver 
and he was found to be not breathing and had no pulse.  
Resuscitation was immediately started and the casualty taken 
by boat and ambulance to hospital.  He was declared dead 
shortly after arrival.  The remaining two divers completed 13 
mins of decompression stops.  The casualty's two dive cylinders 
were subsequently found to contain 0 and 5 bar; at the start of 
the dive both were at 200 bar. 
January 1999  99/074 
Two divers entered the water to commence a dive on a rock 
pinnacle, a moderate current carried them away from the rock 
and they had to swim hard, on the surface, to get to the mooring 
line of the boat.  They recovered their breath and dived to the 
seabed 18m below the boat.  They swam along the bottom, 
attempting to get into the lee of the pinnacle.  They struggled 
against the current and one of the divers, who didn't have 
gloves, cut his hand on a sea urchin and rocks.  Without 
warning this diver stopped breathing and became limp and 
unresponsive.  His buddy attempted to inflate the casualty's 
BCD but it didn't operate.  He offered his alternative air source 
but got no response.  He then took hold of the casualty and, 
inflating his own BCD, brought them both to the surface.  The 
casualty was recovered into a boat and oxygen enhanced 
resuscitation attempts were started.  He was taken by boat and 
ambulance to hospital where he was pronounced dead.  On 
subsequent examination his cylinder was found to be empty.  
The buddy had 50 bar remaining, their dive time had been 14 
mins.  It is believed that a post mortem indicated death by 
natural causes. 
March 1999  99/105 
Two divers were diving on a wreck at a maximum depth of 30m.  
25 mins into the dive, at a depth of 20m they were approached 
by a third unknown diver.  This diver was without a fin and did 
not have his regulator in his mouth.  One of the pair gave this 
diver his octopus regulator, he took several large breaths of air 
and started to gag.  The rescuing diver led them back to the 
shotline where they were joined by other members of the 
distressed diver's party.  Just before the shot was reached the 
distressed diver stopped breathing.  The rescuing diver and the 
leader of the casualty's party made a rapid ascent to the 
surface with the casualty.  The casualty was recovered into the 
boat and resuscitation started.  The casualty was taken back to 
the shore but failed to recover.  The casualty had run out of air 
and is reported to have had a heart attack. 
September 1999  99/255 
Three divers conducted a dive to 61m.  15 mins after they had 
left the surface, two other divers also started their dive.  Both 
groups used a shotline to descend and ascend.  The three 
divers were decompressing on the shotline when the pair 
ascended to make their stops.  At 20m, one of the pair stopped 
ascending and his buddy re-descended to assist him.  The diver 
who had stopped had only 50 bar remaining in his cylinder and 
the buddy could not make him ascend.  He put air into the 
diver's BCD but he would not ascend.  At this point the troubled 
diver ran out of air and his buddy supplied his octopus 
regulator.  The buddy then noticed that the diver's leg was 
entangled in the shotline, but he was not able to free it as the 
octopus hose prevented him from reaching down.  At this point 
the buddy's air supply also ran out.  The other three divers 
realised that there was a problem and came back down to 
assist.  One of the three provided the buddy with an octopus 
regulator but the entangled diver was unconscious and unable 
to accept an air supply.  Another of the three divers cut the 
shotline and, because of the inflated BCD, the casualty and two 
others were carried directly to the surface.  They were all 
recovered into their boat.  Resuscitation techniques were 
applied to the casualty, he started to breathe and was placed in 
the recovery position.  The casualty then turned himself onto his 
back and was heard to be groaning.  He was flown by helicopter 
to hospital but was found to be dead on arrival.  None of the 
other divers suffered any symptoms. 
 
Decompression 
 
November 1998  99/058 
A diver started a dive but at 16m it was aborted after a problem 
with her buddy's neck seal, and they returned to the surface.  12 
mins later this diver dived again to a depth of 31m for a dive 
time of 26 mins with a 1 min stop at 6m.  She later suffered DCI 
and required recompression treatment. 
December 1998  99/067 
Two pairs of divers conducted a dive to 35m.  One diver lost 
control of his buoyancy during the ascent and missed 2 mins of 
stops.  It is thought that lack of familiarity with his drysuit dump 
valve and carrying an SMB reel may have contributed to this.  
The divers were placed on oxygen as a precaution.  A leaking 
valve meant that all of the oxygen was consumed in 10 mins. 11 
mins after surfacing one of the other divers complained of back 
pain and then 'pins and needles'.  No further oxygen was 
available and he was taken to a recompression facility.  Both 
divers were recompressed, although the first had no symptoms.  
The second diver received two further treatments.  A possible 
back injury was cited. 
May 1999  99/178 
Two divers completed a dive to 30m for a duration of 30 mins.  
Some time later they dived again to 32m for 35 mins, and 
completed 7 mins stops at 6m.  1 hour later one of the pair 
complained of a numbness in his limbs.  He was placed on 
oxygen and the Coastguard contacted.  The diver was 
examined by a doctor and transferred to a recompression 
facility for treatment.  His buddy was recompressed with him as 
a precaution.  The following day he received a second 
recompression treatment.  This diver had been diving with Nitox 
32, his buddy was using air. 
June 1999  99/318 
A diver diving on the French side of the English Channel, dived 
to 48m but missed 21 minutes of stops due to buoyancy 
problems. The result was DCI. Solent CG responded to the Pan 
Pan broadcast and arranged for a French helicopter to airlift her 
to a hyperbaric unit in Le Havre.  (Coastguard report). 
August 1999  99/243 
©BSAC - 1999   31 

  NDC Diving Incidents Report - 1999 
A diver completed a dive to 37m for 35 mins with 7 mins 
decompression stops.  5 hours later he dived again to 41m for 
30 mins with 7 mins decompression.  Whilst waiting to be 
picked up he swallowed some seawater.  He was recovered 
into the boat and 10 mins later began to be seasick.  He 
complained that he felt dizzy and lay down.  He was taken to a 
recompression facility and recompressed several times over a 5 
day period, he returned home and received two further periods 
of recompression.  He was diagnosed as having an inner ear 
bend and advised to stop diving. 
 
 
 
Injury/Illness 
January 1999  99/085 
Two divers conducted a 42 mins dive to a maximum depth of 
30m including a 2 min precautionary stop.  At the surface one 
diver discovered an itchy skin rash on both upper arms.  An 
allergic reaction or a skin bend is thought to have been the 
cause.  The rash disappeared after 2 hours 30 mins.  No further 
effects were noted. 
January 1999  99/091 
A diver completed a dive to 12m for a total of 35 mins.  The dive 
included a number of training drills.  After the dive he 
complained of a pain in his right ear.  He received medical 
attention and the symptoms slowly resolved.  It is thought that 
the eardrum became stretched during the ascent. 
April 1999  99/110 
Two divers were conducting a dive to 19m.  After 8 mins one of 
the pair experienced problems with his mask and they decided 
to abort the dive.  They made a normal ascent and completed a 
1 min safety stop at 6m.  On surfacing the diver complained of 
dizziness and a numb upper right forearm.  He was placed on 
oxygen and taken ashore.  Medical advice was sought and it 
was decided to monitor the casualty.  A full recovery was made.  
It is suggested that an overly small wetsuit and tight BCD 
shoulder straps caused circulation problems to the arm. 
May 1999  99/141 
A diver complained of difficulty clearing his ears during the 
second dive of the day.  The following day he dived to 20m 
without problem.  3 hours later he dived again to 20m without 
problem.  On surfacing it was found that he had blood and 
mucus in his mask.  Subsequent medical examination revealed 
a ruptured eardrum and a burst sinus.  He recalled having 
difficulty clearing his ears on the first dive of the day. 
May 1999  99/139 
A diver was climbing a ladder to get back into a boat at the end 
of her dive.  At the top of the ladder the index finger of her left 
hand was trapped between the ladder and the boat and 
crushed.  Limited first aid equipment was available in the boat.  
The diver was treated for shock and given oxygen for 15 mins.  
On return to shore she went to hospital and eight stitches were 
used to close the wound. 
August 1999  99/213 
A diver on a nitrox course completed a dive to 29m for 27 mins 
using nitrox 33.  His dive profile required 1 min stop at 6m, and 
he actually completed 8 mins at this depth practising gas 
switching.  On surfacing he complained of cramp in his leg, 
slight nausea, and of 'seeing stars'.  He was recovered into the 
boat and given fluids.  During the return journey he began to 
feel worse and he was placed on oxygen.  Once ashore he was 
taken to a medical facility for examination.  The problem was 
diagnosed as dehydration and the diver recovered after 2 
hours. 
August 1999  99/247 
A diver completed a dive to 38m for 43 mins with 6 mins 
decompression at 6m.  1 hour 11 mins later he dived again to 
30m for a total of 44 mins including 8 mins decompression at 
6m and 4 mins at 3m.  Later, on the boat, he felt dizzy and 
nauseous, his pupils were pinpointed and his skin was clammy.  
His pulse was strong.  He was given oxygen.  He vomited.  He 
was taken to hospital and placed on oxygen and given IV fluids.  
ECG and chest x-ray were satisfactory.  He remained in 
hospital for observation overnight. 
September 1999  99/254 
A diver surfaced after completing a training lift from 3m and 
complained of dizziness, visual disturbances, slight nausea and 
cramp.  He was placed in the shade and given fluids.  He soon 
recovered.  This had occurred before, and the diver reported 
that he had had difficulty breathing in a regular and relaxed way 
whilst underwater.  The diver sought medical advice. 
 
 
 
 
Boating / Surface Incidents 
October 1998  99/025 
A snorkel diver was hit by a large wave.  Her mask was filled 
with water and she gasped for breath.  Her buddy tried to assist 
but she became exhausted and started to sink.  Two other 
snorkellers pulled her to the surface and got her into the boat 
where she recovered.  (Newspaper report only) 
October 1998  99/138 
On completion of a dive, a diver was back in a small boat 
stowing his equipment when the cox started off at full speed.  
The diver was unbalanced and dropped his kit into the boat to 
hang on.  A large wave hit this diver and he was thrown into the 
water, together with some of his kit.  He pushed himself clear of 
the boat as he fell in.  The boat stopped and he and others 
recovered all of his kit, except his mask, which sank and was 
lost.  The diver reported no injuries. 
October 1998  99/057 
Two divers had completed a dive to 30m and were hanging 
onto their boat's anchor line decompressing.  One diver 
released the line and was making his way to the side of their 
RHIB when an outboard engine was heard.  Their boat was 
flying an 'A' flag and they paid little attention to the sound.  
Suddenly one of the pair saw a fast approaching propeller and 
pulled his buddy down, injuring his shoulder in the process.  
The propeller passed beside this diver's head and he felt the 
wash from it.   
March 1999  99/107 
Two pairs of divers were operating from a boat close to a reef 
with an unmanned lighthouse in a remote area, 37 nautical 
miles from the coast.  One pair was underwater when a sudden 
squall and high waves broke the mooring line and swamped the 
boat.  The two in the boat tried to manoeuvre it to tie it to the 
lighthouse platform.  One climbed onto this platform but the line 
parted again and the boat was washed away and capsized; one 
of the pair stayed with it.  The two divers underwater heard the 
boat engines being started and surfaced.  They swam to the 
light platform and climbed onto it.  The alarm was raised when

the boat was realised to be overdue and several boats and 
three helicopters were launched.  In darkness the upturned boat 
and the crew in the water were spotted using night vision 
equipment, a liferaft was dropped and this person was 
subsequently recovered by one of the search craft.  The three 
on the platform were also spotted from a helicopter and they too 
were recovered.  All were treated for dehydration and sunburn, 
and one for ingestion of fuel. 
 
 
 
Ascents 
August 1999  99/218 
Two divers conducted a dive to 24m.  16 mins into the dive one 
of the pair was unable to control their buoyancy and they made 
a rapid ascent to the surface.  At the surface, 10 mins after 
surfacing, the other diver complained of a pain in his left arm, 
and was taken to a recompression facility for treatment.  It was 
subsequently concluded that this pain was not DCI. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Technique 
July 1999  99/199 
A trainee and an instructor were diving at 14m as part of a 
crossover course.  The trainee was diving without a hood.  4 
mins into the dive the trainee indicated that there was 
something wrong with his regulator and switched to his octopus 
regulator.  He then spat this out and attempted to rush to the 
surface.  The instructor took hold of the trainee and attempted 
to give him his alternative air source.  This was refused and the 
trainee swam to the surface with the instructor.  At the surface 
he recovered.  He stated that he felt that his regulator had 
become flooded.  An inspection of the regulator did not reveal 
any fault. 
 
 
 
Equipment 
November 1998  99/055 
Two divers were 15 mins into a wreck dive with a maximum 
depth of 23m.  One indicated that he had 100 bar remaining in 
his cylinder.  3 mins later he was down to 50 bar.  They decided 
to abort the dive and commenced an ascent up the anchor line 
of their boat.  During the ascent the diver indicated that he was 
down to 25 bar and bubbles were seen to be coming from his 
instrument console.  His buddy gave him his alternative air 
source and they completed a normal ascent with a 1 min safety 
stop.  A damaged 'O' ring seal was subsequently found.  No 
subsequent ill effects were reported. 
May 1999  99/167 
A diver was descending to a wreck in a depth of 39m.  At 18m 
he saw one of the weight pouches from his weightbelt dropping 
to the seabed.  He and his buddy aborted the dive and they 
returned to the surface, attempting to control their ascent rate.  
The buoyant diver's computer indicated a warning.  No 
subsequent ill effects were experienced.
