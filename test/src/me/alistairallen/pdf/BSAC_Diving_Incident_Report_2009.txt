Introduction 
 
This booklet contains the 2009 Diving Incidents Report, produced by The British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC) in the 
interest of promoting diving safety.  It is important to note that it contains details of UK sports diving incidents 
occurring to divers of all affiliations, plus incidents occurring worldwide involving BSAC members.  
 
Report Format 
The majority  of statistical information contained w ithin this report is also show n in graphica l form.  Please note that all 
statistical information is produced fr om UK data only  and does not include Overseas Incidents unless noted as ‘All 
Incidents’. 
 
The contents of this report are split into  an overview of the year, and then the details of nine incident categories plus some 
historical analyses.  The various sections can be found as shown below:- 
 
 i) Overview Page  1 
 ii) Fatalities Page 5 
 iii) Decompression Incidents Page  8 
 iv) Injury / illness Page  18 
 v) Boating & Surface Incidents Page  24 
 vi) Ascent Incidents Page  31 
 vii) Technique Incidents Page  36 
 viii) Equipment Incidents Page  37 
 ix) Miscellaneous Incidents Page  38 
 x) Overseas Incidents Page  40 
 xi) Numerical & Statistical Analyses Page  43 
 xii) List of Abbreviations Page  45 
 
 
Within each category  the incidents are listed in the order of their occurrence, not necessarily  that of Incident Reference.  
They are laid out in the following form: 
 
  MONTH/YEAR OF INCIDENT  INCIDENT REF.    
  Brief Narrative of Incident.................................................................................... 
  ........................................................................................................ 
 
The nature of many diving incidents is such that there is usually more than one cause or effect.  Where this is the case the 
incident has been classified under the more appropriate cause or effect. F or instance an incident involving a fast ascent, 
causing decompression illness, will be classified under 'Decompression Incidents'.

NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2009    
Overview 
 
has been a ty pical y ear in terms of the total 
number of incidents reported.  381 UK incidents 
have been recorded and this is entirely  in line 
with recent years where the average has been around 400.   
2009 Incidents by category The incident database assigns all incidents into one of nine 
major categories, and the following chart shows the distribution 
of the 2009 incidents into those categories.  
Information is gathered from a number of different sources; 
divers’ incident reporting, the MCA, the RNLI, media sources 
etc.   This y ear has seen two changes that could have affected 
the number of reports analy sed.  Firstly , one of our sources of 
information has provided less r eports than normal (and I think 
this is less reporting rather than few er incidents).  Secondly , 
one of the other diving agencies has opened a new  source of 
incident information (for which I thank them).  I think it probable 
that these two actions have resulted in an overall largely neutral 
effect on the total number of incidents reported.

Number of incidents
As in all previous y ears (except 2007) the largest category 
relates to cases of ‘Decompression illness ( DCI)’.   DCI cases 
saw a dramatic reduction in 2007 and it w as hoped that this 
marked the beginning of a dow nward trend.  However, 2008 
and 2009 have seen a return to the average of recent years and 
it would seem that around 120 (reported) cases per year is the 
norm.  More detail on these incidents is given later. 
  Incident year  The second largest category is ‘Boating and Surface’ incidents.  
This category mainly comprises of problems w ith boat engines 
(engine failure and out of fuel) and lost diver(s).  This category  
had seen a very  strong dow nward trend over the previous 12 
years due to reductions in both ty pes of incident; w ith the 2008 
total being 60% down from the total recorded in 1998.  2009 
however has seen this number in crease by almost 100% over 
last year and the numbers have returned to the level 
experienced around 2002.  This increase is almost all due to an 
increase in the number of reported boating problems coupled 
with a very  minor increase in the number of cases of lost 
diver(s).   
 
 
The distribution of reported incidents by  month is show n in the 
following chart and it follows the normal pattern, with 68% of the 
dives taking place in the summer m onths.  There is a slight dip 
in July  but this is likely  to be due to the timing of holidays, 
possibly w eather and most likely  the natural variations that 
occur with relatively small numbers.   
 
 
Incidents by month - 2009 
 
The third category  is ‘Illness and injury ’ and the bulk of this is 
thought to be cases of DCI.  But these cases are reported 
through the RNLI and their reports do not specifically  record 
DCI, they often just state ‘Diver illness’.  For this reason it is not 
possible to distinguish cases of DCI from other diver ailments.  
However, my belief is that as many  as 80% of the incidents in 
this category relate to cases of DCI.

The fourth category is ‘Ascents’ w here divers have made an 
abnormal ascent but avoided DCI.  This is an area that has 
received a lot of attention over recent years.  Between 1997 and 
2006 there w as a strong trend of increasing incidents in this 
category.  The last three y ears saw this trend reversed and the 
2009 total sees that downward trend continuing; a result, I 
believe, of the efforts that have been made to improve training 
in this area.  More on ‘Ascents’ can be found later in this report.       Although small in number ‘Fatalit ies’ are the most important 
category and these are also covered later in some detail.

Incident depths 
The following chart shows the maximum depth of the dives 
during which incidents took place, categorised into depth range 
groupings.

The pattern of depths in the 0m to 50m range is very similar to 
that normally seen and reflects the amount of diving that takes 
place in these depth ranges.   
The number of incidents reported in the greater than 50m range 
is 11, w hich is in line w ith pr evious y ears.  One of these 
incidents was a fatality which occurred during a dive to 52m. 
  
BSAC advises that no air dive should be deeper than 50m, and 
that dives to 50m should only be conducted by  divers w ho are 
appropriately trained and qualified.   
The recommended limit for divers trained to Sports Diver 
standard is 35m and then only  w hen they  have received 
appropriate training for diving at this depth. 
BSAC recommends that helium mixtures are used for depths 
deeper than 40m and that mixed gas diving should be to a 
maximum depth of 80m.  Mixed gas dives should only  be 
conducted w hen the diver holds a recognized qualification to 
conduct such dives.  
See the BSAC website for more details of these and other 
diving depth limit recommendations.  
 
The next chart shows the depths at which incidents started.

Inevitably the data are biased towards the shallower depths 
since many  incidents happen during the ascent or at the 
surface.  Critical among these are the DCI cases w here almost 
always the casualty is out of the water before any problems are 
noted.  This partially  explains the large occurrence of ‘Surface’ 
cases as this includes divers with DCI who have left the water. 
Other surface incidents involve boats and boating incidents and 
divers who are lost but on the surface.   
 
 
Diver qualifications

Divers’ use of the Emergency Services 
Divers’ use of the emergency  services show s a monthly  
distribution aligned to the distri bution of all incidents, and is 
clearly correlated with the number of dives that are taking place. 
 
238 incidents were reported to us by  the Coastguard; this is a 
little higher than the average of re cent years which has typically 
been around 210.

Incidents involving HM Coastguard: 238  
 
 
There were 134 incidents reported that involved the RNLI and 
this represents a dramatic increas e over previous y ears.  The 
trend over the previous 11 y ears had been a progressive 
reduction from a total of 130 reports in 1998 to less than 100 in 
2007; the 2008 total puts us back to w here we were in 1998.  
This increase is largely  due to the previously  discussed 
increase in the number of boating incidents and in cases of DCI 
where the RNLI are often involved in the evacuation of divers to 
a recompression facility.

In 2009 99 incidents involved the use of helicopters.  This 
number indicates a levelling out of  incidents involving helicopter 
rescue to about 100 per year.  
In diving related incidents helicopters are mainly  tasked to 
support searches for missing divers  and to transport divers with 
DCI to recompression facilities.

year.  This is below  the average of 16.1 fatalities per y ear over 
the previous ten y ears.  How ever, comparisons of this nature 
need to be made with caution since a small change can make a 
big apparent difference to the result.   
Although it is clearly a good thing that this number is below  the 
average of recent y ears it hides the sad fact that 7 of these 
people were BSAC members.  The ten y ear average for BSAC 
fatalities in the UK is 6.0 fatalities per year and thus, from a 
member’s perspective, it has been an unfortunate year. 
The factors associated w ith these fatalities can be summarised 
as follows:- 
? One case involved a diver w ho is known to have had a 
heart attack and from the descriptions received it seems 
probable that some serious medical complication may  have 
been responsible in up to six other cases, but there is 
currently no hard evidence to prove this.  
? Eight cases involved a separation of some kind.  Two cases 
occurred during the ascent from a dive when divers became 
separated; one of these cases involved the use of an 
alternative gas source. Tw o cases involved three divers 
diving together; in one case a diver had a free flow  and left 
the other tw o and in the other case one of the three lost 
contact with his buddies and was found unconscious. Two 
cases involved divers w ho lost consciousness underwater 
leading to their separation from their buddies. One case 
involved a double fatality  w here the divers surfaced 
separately, one unconscious and the other losing 
consciousness very shortly afterwards. 
? Three cases involved three di vers diving together (includes 
the two cases mentioned above). 
? One case involved a solo rebreather diver who re-entered 
the water for a shallow dive.   
 
ften multiple causes w ere involvO
except one of these fatal incidents there is currently  insufficient 
information available to be clear about the exact chain of events 
and specific root causes. 
 
iver age may have beenD
8 (57%) of this y ear’s fatalities involved divers over the age of 
50.  This is against a background of 16% of the diving 
population in this age range (from a BSAC UK site survey).  The 
natural tendency  is for health and fitness to decline with 
increasing age and the above numbers seem to indicate that 
divers need to pay more attention to these aspects as they grow 
older.

  ` NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2009 
Decompression incidents Conclusions 
The BSAC database contains 111 reports of ‘DCI’ incidents in 
the 2009 incident y ear, some of w hich involved more than one 
casualty.  When these multiple cases are counted the result is 
117 cases of DCI. 
Key conclusions are:- 
? The number of incidents reported each y ear in the UK has 
levelled out to around 400. 
? The number of fatalities of BSAC members is one above 
the average of the previous 10 years.  
An analysis of the causal factors associated w ith the 111 
incidents reported in 2009 indicates the follow ing major 
features:- 
? The number of fatalities of non-BSAC members is lower 
than the average of the previous 10 years. 
? Diver age and related health and fitness issues may  have 
been a strong causal factor in this y ear’s fatalities.  The 
average age of this y ear’s fatalities is 51; the average age 
of the back ground diving population is 38. 
41 involved diving to deeper than 30m 
31 involved rapid ascents 
26 involved repeat diving  
22 involved missed decompression stops  ? The number of ‘Boating’ incidents has increased 
dramatically. Some cases involved more than one of these causes. 
 ? Cases of ‘Ascent’ problems continue to fall.   
As stated earlier, some of the ‘Injury  and Illness’ incidents are 
also thought to be DCI related.   
 
 
 As has been stated many  times before, most of the incidents 
reported w ithin this document could have been avoided had 
those involved follow ed a few  basic  principles of safe diving 
practice.  The BSAC publishes a booklet called 'Safe Diving' 
(latest edition published in January 2009). which summarises all 
the key elements of safe diving and is available to all, free of 
charge, from the BSAC website or through BSAC HQ. 
 
Ascent related incidents 
‘Ascent’ related incidents have fallen dramatically  over recent 
years and some of this decline is likely  to be due to the focus 
that has been placed on this important area of diving skill. 
 
54 cases of ‘Ascent’ problems have been recorded in 2009 and 
nearly all of these w ere ‘rapid ascents’.  An analysis of these 
‘rapid ascents’ (where the detail is known) is as follows:- 
 
Remember y ou can never have too much practice and the 
further y ou stay  aw ay from the limits of y our ow n personal 
capabilities the more likely  y ou are to continue to enjoy your 
diving. 
 33% Simply poor buoyancy control  
 15% Panic / anxiety / rush for surface  
 10% Weighting or weight related problems  
 5% Out of air / gas Please browse through the details in this report and use them to 
learn from others’ mistakes . They  have had the courage and 
generosity to record their experi ences for publication, the least 
that we can do is to use this  information to avoid similar 
problems. 
 5% Delayed SMB problems 
    3% Regulator free flows 
    3% Drysuit control malfunction 
  
It is certain that many other such cases have gone un-reported 
but it is anticipated that these root causes w ill apply  to all 
uncontrolled ascents.   
 
Finally, if y ou must have an incident please report it using our 
Incident Report form, available free via the BSAC w ebsite or 
from BSAC HQ.  
Many DCI cases have their roots in these problems; they have 
been recorded under the ‘DCI’ heading but the causal factors 
are often the same, so the actual number of abnormal ascents 
will be significantly higher than 54 cases.   
As always, your anonymity is assured – great care is taken to 
preserve the confidentiality  of any personal information 
recorded in BSAC Incident Reports.

Fatalities 
 
October 2008 09/001 
Two divers conducted an uneventful dive to a maximum depth 
of 16m.  During their ascent they made a safety  stop at 6m.  At 
the surface one of the pair lost consciousness.  He w as 
recovered into the boat and resuscitation techniques w ere 
applied.  The Coastguard w as alerted and the casualty  w as 
taken by helicopter and ambulance to hospital w here he later 
died.  During the helicopter lift the winch failed and the casualty  
and winchman had to be low ered back down on the end of the 
winch line.  (Coastguard report). 
October 2008 09/002 
Three divers entered the water and swam in a strong current to 
reach their shotline.  They  descended to the w reck, to a 
maximum depth of 30m, and one of the three moved to join 
another dive pair as previously  planned.  The remaining tw o 
divers swam deeper towards the rudder of the w reck.  One of 
the pair disturbed silt on the seabed and disappeared in the 
cloud of silt.  The other dive r hovered above the cloud looking 
for his buddy .  The cloud rose up to the hovering diver and he 
rose up to stay in clearer water.  He spotted his buddy's bubbles 
and swam towards her.  The buddy then appeared out of the silt 
cloud and they signalled to each other to ascend.  Their ascent 
was erratic; at times they rose too fast, at other times they  sank 
back down.  The diver w ho had been in the silt cloud declined 
her buddy's suggestion to conduct a safety  stop at 4m and they  
continued to the surface.  Their dive duration w as 4 min.  At the 
surface there w as a sizeable sw ell and the buddy started to 
deploy his delayed SMB.  He then heard the diver w ho had 
been in the silt cloud groan and then saw  her faint.  The buddy 
inflated her BCD to support her at the surface and gave an 
emergency signal to the boat.  The casualty  was recovered into 
the boat and resuscitation techniques w ere applied.  She was 
taken ashore and further resuscitation w as attempted by  
attending paramedics and a doctor.  The diver w as transferred 
to hospital where she was declared dead.  The cause of death 
was given as 'convulsion while diving'. 
January 2009 09/022 
A diver aborted his first dive due to a free flow ing regulator.  
Later he dived again with another trainee and an instructor.  
During this dive he experienced a regulator free flow  again and 
left the instructor and the other trainee.  The other trainee 
signalled to the instructor that the first trainee had surfaced w ith 
a regulator problem.  When the instructor and the other trainee  
surfaced they found that the diver w ith the free flow was not to 
be seen.  A search w as quickly initiated and the missing diver 
was found unconscious at a depth of 35m.  He w as brought to 
the surface and resuscitation techniques w ere applied.  The 
emergency services w ere alerted and the diver was airlifted to 
hospital where he was declared dead. 
April 2009 09/073 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 22m for 35 
min.  They  made their ascent up an underw ater cliff face and 
then deployed a delayed SMB to continue their ascent.  One of 
the pair then made a rapid ascent to the surface, signalled 
distress and then sank back dow n.  An underwater search was 
conducted and the diver w as raised to the surface.  
Resuscitation techniques w ere applied and the emergency  
services alerted.  The casual ty w as transferred to hospital 
where he was declared dead on arrival. 
 
 
April 2009 09/074 
A rebreather diver entered the water from the shore to recover a 
lost w eightbelt.  The alarm w as raised w hen the diver was 
spotted floating on his back, motionless at the surface.  A 
nearby diver w ent to the casualty  and tow ed him to the shore 
giving rescue breaths on the w ay.  Once ashore further 
resuscitation techniques were applied and breathing and a good 
pulse were soon re-established.  A number of Coastguard and 
RNLI personnel w ere exercising in the area and they  came to 
help.  The casualty  was airlift ed to hospital but died that night 
without regaining consciousness. 
April 2009 09/077 
A pair of divers conducted a w reck dive to an approximate 
depth of 52m.  At this point they signalled to each other that 
they would turn to make their way back.  One of the pair moved 
off but quickly realised that his buddy was not following him.  He 
went back and found his buddy , he had his regulator out of his 
mouth and he was not responding.  The buddy  tried to put the 
diver's regulator back into his mouth and then he tried his 
octopus regulator; neither was accepted.  The buddy  then lifted 
the casualty to the surface us ing a controlled buoy ant lift; their 
ascent was quite fast.  Once back in the boat resuscitation 
techniques were applied and the Coastguard w as alerted.  The 
casualty was taken by lifeboat and then airlifted to hospital but 
he failed to recover.

A pair of divers became separated during a wreck dive.  One of 
the pair conducted a search but w as not able to locate his 
buddy so he surfaced.  The second diver did not surface.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and an underw ater and a surface 
search involving two helicopters, a fixed w ing aircraft, a lifeboat 
and other vessels w as initiated.  The missing diver's body  was 
found on the seabed by other divers 15 day s later.  It w as 
recovered by  police divers after a further 2 days.  A post 
mortem analysis indicated that the casualty had suffered a heart 
attack.

May 2009 09/076 
A pair of divers conducted a dive  to a maximum depth of 28m.  
One of the pair deployed his delayed SMB and made an ascent, 
missing a planned safety stop.  When he surfaced the boat was 
nearby and the other diver w as floating motionless in the water 
in the same area.  The skipper instructed the diver to get the 
casualty onto the diver lift and he w as recovered into the boat.  
The buddy  also got back onto the boat and commenced 
resuscitation.  As other divers from the party surfaced they 
assisted with the resuscitation.  The Coastguard w as alerted 
and the boat headed for harbour.  The casualty  was transferred 
onto a lifeboat and then airlifted to hospital.  Initially  the diver 
showed signs of improvement but died later that evening.

delayed SMB to make their ascent.  Once he had done this he 
looked around for his buddy  and saw  that he had floated up a 
little and w as sw imming back dow n.  The diver w ith the SMB 
then indicated to the buddy to put his hand around the SMB line 
and they started their ascent.  The diver then noticed that the 
buddy had started to descend so he removed the buddy's finger 
from the deflate button of his BCD and started to inflate it.  At 
this point he saw  that the buddy 's mouthpiece had come out of 
his mouth and that his eyes were very large.  He immediately let 
go of the SMB and used a controlled buoy ant lift to bring him to 
the surface.  At the surface the alarm w as raised and the boat 
was quickly alongside the divers.  The casualty  was recovered 
into the boat where he was found to be unconscious.  The 
Coastguard w as alerted and resuscitation techniques were 
applied.  The boat w as met by  a lifeboat and the casualty and 
his buddy were transported to hospital.  The casualty  failed to 
recover.

Two divers entered the water to conduct a dive to a depth of 
48m.  The divers sent the boat's anchor to the surface as 
expected.  Shortly  afterwards one of the divers' delay ed SMB 
appeared; it w as then pulled below  the surface.  The boat 
followed the bubbles.  The diver then appeared at the surface, 
face down with his drysuit fully inflated.  He w as recovered into 
the boat and the tw o people in the boat started resuscitation 
techniques.  The Coastguard w as alerted and a helicopter was 
tasked to assist.  The second diver's delayed SMB then 
appeared at the surface follow ed by  the diver who gave a 
distress signal.  The boat moved to him and passed him an 
oxygen demand valve.  He then lost consciousness and started 
to drift from the boat.  The tw o in the boat pulled him back and 
recovered him from the w ater.  They  informed the Coastguard 
that they  had  two casualties and started resuscitation 
techniques on the second casualty .  The helicopter arrived and 
both casualties were winched aboard.  They  w ere flow n to a 
hospital where they were declared dead on arrival. 
August 2009 09/196 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 25m.  One 
of the pair deployed a delayed SMB for their ascent at the end 
of the dive.  They  made a safety  stop during w hich time one of 
the pair had to switch to his alternative regulator; in doing so he 
got a mouthful of w ater.  He took his buddy 's alternative air 
source and again got a mouthful of w ater.  During this time they 
sank back to the seabed.  At this point the diver w ho had been 
swapping regulators released his w eightbelt and made a 
buoyant ascent to the surface.  He w as spotted by those in the 
boat face down and unresponsive.  The second diver arrived at 
the surface shortly  afterwards in a distressed state.  The boat 
crew recovered the first diver and then moved to the second 
who had by this time lost consciousness.  He too was recovered 
into the boat.  The first diver w as revived and resuscitation 
techniques were applied to the second diver.  The Coastguard 
was alerted and the casualties were moved onto a lifeboat and 
then airlifted to hospital.  T he first diver w as released from 
hospital.  The second w as placed in intensive care but died the 
following day.

An instructor and tw o trainees w ere conducting a w reck dive 
with the instructor leading.  One of the trainees w as then found 
to be missing and the instructor and the other trainee searched 
for him.  They  found him face dow n on the bottom with no 
regulator in his mouth.  The instructor could not get the 
regulator back into the casualty 's mouth.  She inflated his BCD 
and sent him to the surface.  The casualty  w as spotted 
unconscious at the surface and recovered into a nearby  dive 
boat.  Resuscitation techniques were applied and the casualty  
was brought ashore.  Despite efforts to save him he failed to 
recover.  It  was suggested that a heart condition may  have 
been responsible.

Decompression Incidents 
 
October 2008  09/059 
A diver surfaced from a 43m dive missing stops.  The 
Coastguard w as alerted and the diver w as transferred to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
October 2008 09/007 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 36m for a 
duration of 35 min including a 1 min stop at 12m and a 2 min 
stop at 6m.  About 1 hour after this dive he began to feel giddy 
and disorientated and he was sick.  He w as placed on oxy gen 
and the Coastguard was alerted.  He was taken by lifeboat and 
ambulance to a recompression facility where he was treated for 
DCI.  It was suggested that treatment for an ear infection which 
began 2 weeks prior to the dive may have been a causal factor. 
October 2008 09/010 
A pair of divers conducted a w reck dive to a maximum depth of 
50m.  One of the pair w as using trimix 18/31 w ith nitrox 42 and 
nitrox 84 for decompression.  The other was using air with nitrox 
72 for decompression.  At 47m the divers attached a lifting bag  
to an object that they found, this did not lift the object so they  
used two delayed SMB buoys to send the object to the surface.  
They ascended to the top of the wreck at a depth of 34m and 
after a dive duration of 32 min they  deployed a delayed SMB to 
make their ascent.  They  began their ascent and the air diver 
indicated that his air supply was low, he switched to his buddy's 
main supply for several minutes.  They  made a rapid ascent to 
10m.  They  became tangled in the SMB line.  The diver who 
was low  on air attempted to sw itch to his decompression gas 
but found that the regulator would not work; he switched back to 
his buddy's gas supply .  They  lost buoyancy control and sank 
back to 23m, still entangled in the line.  The buddy  took control 
and they  made a rapid ascent to the surface.  The buddy  
immediately descended back to 6m to make his decompression 
stops and he surfaced after a dive duration of 86 min and 
developed no symptoms.  The diver w ho was low  on air w as 
recovered into the boat, his dive duration w as 39 min, he w as 
breathing from his now  w orking nitrox 72 cy linder.  He was 
placed on oxygen, given fluids and the Coastguard was alerted.  
The diver, whose only symptom was a small nose bleed, w as 
airlifted to a recompression facility where he was treated. 
October 2008 09/011 
An instructor conducted a training dive to a maximum depth of 
18m for 35 min including a 2 min stop at 6m.  50 min later he 
conducted a second training dive  to a maximum depth of 16m 
for 25 min w ith a 2 min stop at 6m.  The training consisted of 
the mid-w ater deploy ment of a delay ed SMB and poor 
buoyancy control on behalf of the trainees resulted in the 
instructor making a number of ascents and descents during the 
dive.  30 min after the last dive the instructor became dizzy  and 
he was sick.  He w as placed on oxy gen and the emergency  
services were alerted.  He w as taken to hospital and then to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  He is thought to have had 
a vestibular DCI. 
October 2008 09/062 
Two divers developed symptoms of DCI after making a rapid 
ascent from 29m and missing stops.  The Coastguard was 
alerted and medical advice w as sought.  The divers were 
airlifted to a recompression facility.  (Coastguard report). 
 
October 2008 09/064 
A diver developed symptoms of DCI after a dive to 48m.  The 
Coastguard w as alerted and the diver w as transferred to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
October 2008 09/065 
A diver conducted dives to 34m and 38m and then developed 
symptoms of DCI.  The Coastguard w as alerted and the diver 
was tr ansferred to a r ecompression facility  for  treatment.  
(Coastguard report). 
October 2008 09/068 
A diver who w as suffering from DCI w as transferred from 
hospital to a recompression facility  by ambulance.  (Coastguard 
report). 
October 2008 09/069 
A diver developed DCI after a day's diving.  The Coastguard 
was alerted and the diver w as transferred to a recompression 
facility for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
October 2008 09/071 
Two divers made a rapid asc ent from 19m.  They  developed 
symptoms of DCI and the Coastguard w as alerted.  The divers 
were air lifted to a r ecompression facility  for  tr eatment.  
(Coastguard report). 
November 2008 09/055 
The Coastguard was alerted when a diver developed symptoms 
of DCI following his second dive of the day.  He was airlifted to 
a r ecompression facility  w here he r eceived r ecompression 
treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
December 2008 09/056 
A diver developed symptoms of DCI after a dive to 27m.  He 
was taken by  ambulance to a r ecompression facility for 
treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
December 2008 09/027 
A diver conducted a 24 min dive to a maximum depth of 19m.  
During his ascent he made a 3 min stop at 6m.  He awoke early 
the following morning with an uncomfortable feeling in his right 
arm.  He sought medical advice and w ent to his local hospital.  
He was diagnosed with DCI and transferred to a recompression 
chamber.  He received tw o sessions of recompression 
treatment.  The water temperature was 6 deg C. 
January 2009 09/031 
An instructor and two trainees entered the w ater to practise the 
use of an SMB.  The divers  conducted a surface buoy ancy 
check and then descended to 6m and conducted a second 
buoyancy check.  They descended an underwater rock face to a 
depth of 18m.  At this depth they practised clipping and 
unclipping their SMBs.  Then the instructor noticed that one of 
the trainees seemed to be havi ng problems with her buoy ancy 
control and could not hold a stable position in the w ater.  He 
approached the trainee w ho seemed somewhat unresponsive.  
He signalled the ascent and brought the troubled diver to the 
surface using a  controlled buoyant lift.  Their dive duration w as 
7 min.  At the surface all divers appeared w ell but they decided 
to abandon further dives.  The second trainee then said that he

wanted to return to the shore as he w as having difficulty  
breathing.  The instructor tow ed him to the shore and he was 
assisted from the water.  This trainee thought that he might 
have made a faster than normal ascent and he w as placed on 
oxygen.  He complained of a feeling of liquid on his lungs, he 
coughed up some pink froth and a faint gurgling noise could be 
heard when he inhaled.  The emergenc y services were alerted; 
a paramedic attended and the casualty  was airlifted to hospital.  
Some lung trauma w as diagnosed and he remained in hospital 
overnight for observation. 
January 2009 09/045 
Two divers made a rapid ascent from a dive.  The Coastguard 
was alerted and the divers w ere taken to a recompression 
facility.  One of the pair w as recompressed.  (Coastguard

February 2009 09/033 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 47m.  With 
decompression stops accumulating the divers started their 
ascent.  One of the pair put air into his dry suit and the valve 
stuck in the open position.  The diver became buoyant and was 
unable to prevent himself from  being carried rapidly  to the 
surface.  His dive duration was 24 min.  At the surface he gave 
an emergency signal and was quickly  helped from the w ater.  
He was placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  He 
was airlifted to a recompression facility  but then transferred to 
hospital for oxy gen treatment and observation.  He had shown 
symptoms of DCI but recompression w as not required.  He was 
discharged the following day. 
February 2009 09/048 
A diver became unwell with possible sy mptoms of DCI after a 
dive to 50m.  The Coastguard w as alerted and the diver w as 
airlifted to a recompression facility.  (Coastguard report). 
February 2009 09/080 
Three divers conducted a 15 min dive to a maximum depth of 
15m and then returned to a platform at 6m.  Here they practised 
mask clearing and regulator retrieval, then they  made three 
assisted ascents.  After the dive one of the group reported that 
she felt a little unw ell but she recovered in time for a second 
dive after a 2 hours 49 min surface interval.  They dived to 17m 
for 15  min and then returned to the platform at 6m.  They 
conducted three practice controll ed buoyant lifts from 6m to the 
surface ending w ith a tow  and simulated rescue breaths.  
During the journey home one of the three noticed a soreness 
and stiffness in her left arm.  About midnight her left arm and 
shoulder developed a prickling and tightness sensation w ith 
reduced feeling.  She used the internet to seek information on 
DCI and to identify  sources of assistance.  The following 
morning she sought diving m edical advice and then attended a 
recompression facility.  She received a ser ies of four  sessions 
of recompression over  a four day  period and w as prescribed 
anti-inflammatory drugs.  Her symptoms were fully resolved. 
February 2009 09/038 
15 min after finishing a dive a diver developed sy mptoms of 
DCI.  The Coastguard was alerted and the diver w as airlifted to 
a recompression facility for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
February 2009 09/049 
A diver had symptoms of DCI after making a rapid ascent from 
6m following a dive to 30m.  Medical advice from the duty diving 
doctor was to take him to hospital for initial assessment.  The 
boat returned to the marina and the diver w as transferred to an 
ambulance w ith the assistance of Shoreham Coastguard, and 
taken to Brighton hospital for assessment.  (Coastguard report). 
March 2009 09/043 
A pair of divers completed a di ve practising survey  techniques 
on an underw ater cliff face.  Their maximum depth was 32m 
and their dive duration w as 58 min including a 1 min stop at 
18m, a 2 min stop at 12m, a 9 min stop at 6m and a 3 min stop 
at 3m.  About an hour later one of the pair started to feel sick 
and dizzy.  He was placed on oxygen and diving medical advice 
was sought.  He w as airlifted to a recompression facility and 
received tw o sessions of recompression therapy.  He was 
diagnosed with a DCI in his inner ear which caused symptoms 
of vertigo.  He w as discharged w ith residual sy mptoms that 
were predicted to resolve with time. 
March 2009 09/072 
A diver developed symptoms of DCI follow ing a dive to 20m.  
The Coastguard was alerted and the diver was transferred to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
March 2009 09/037 
Two divers dived to a maximum depth of 33m.  At 30m they  
deployed a delay ed SMB and this resulted in the octopus 
regulator of one of the divers going into free flow.  The diver 
attempted to stop the free flow  but his air supply  rapidly  
diminished from 80 bar to 50 bar.  The buddy  passed him his 
octopus regulator and turned off the diver's cylinder.  Bubbles in 
the w ater inhibited the divers ' vision and they  made a rapid 
ascent to the surface.  They  ascended to the surface from 30m 
in 50 seconds; their dive duration was 18 min.  The divers w ere 
monitored for sy mptoms of DCI but none w ere found that day.  
Over the next few days one of the pair experienced dizzy spells 
and sought diving medical advice.  He attended a 
recompression facility and a bubble in his ear w as diagnosed.  
He received two sessions of recompression therapy  and his 
symptoms resolved. 
March 2009 09/081 
A diver suffering from DCI w as airlifted to a recompression 
chamber.  (Coastguard report).

March 2009 09/450 
The casualty completed three dives in a day , seemingly without 
incident.  His maximum depth w as 32m.  The next day  he 
complained of pains in his shoulder and thumb.  He w ent to 
hospital for a check up w here he w as given recompression 
treatment. 
March 2009 09/173 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 19m.  After 
25 min they  w ere at a depth of 14m and making their return 
swim.  One of the pair started to experience buoyancy problems 
and struggled to stay  down.  At around 9m visibility  was very 
poor and the dive leader took a compass reading to maintain 
their course.  During this time the buoyant diver's feet came out 
of her dry suit boots and she w as unable to prevent herself 
making an inverted buoy ant ascent to the surface.  Her buddy, 
on realising that she w as not there, searched around for her 
before making his ascent.  Other members of the party on the 
shore saw  the buoy ant diver arrive at the surface and one 
swam out to assist her back to the shore.  The Coastguard w as 
alerted and the diver w as airlifted to a recompression facility .  
She was not found to be suffering from DCI and was transferred 
to hospital for  overnight observation.  She w as released the 
following day and the hospital staff stated that they  thought that 
she had had a mild DCI. 
March 2009 09/092 
A 26 year old diver was flown to the recompression chamber at 
Millport by RN rescue helicopter R177.  The female diver was 
showing symptoms of DCI hav ing made an uncontrolled ascent 
from 20m.  (Coastguard report). 
March 2009 09/279 
A pair of divers conducted a dri ft dive to a maximum depth of 
27m.  After 23 min they decided to make their ascent.  One of 
the pair held a delay ed SMB w hile the other put air into it with 
his octopus regulator.  The regulator got caught on a strap of 
the buoy when it w as released and the diver w as dragged 
upwards.  He managed to free the regulator at a depth of about 
7m but his buoy ancy carried him to the surface.  He had over 
100 bar remaining and he decided to re-descend the line.  He 
found his buddy at 12m and indicated that he wanted to go back 
to the seabed.  They returned to a depth of 20m and, 30 min 
into the dive, they started their ascent.  They stopped at 13m for 
1 min and at 5m for an indicated 5 min.  The swell was causing 
their depth to vary  betw een 3 and 7m.  The divers' 
decompression requirement expired after a total dive duration of 
38 min and they stayed for a further 2 min, surfacing with a total 
duration of 41 min.  The follow ing night, over 24 hours later, the 
diver who had been pulled up by the buoy noticed a tingling and 
numbness spreading from his extremit ies to all of his limbs.  He 
sought diving medical advice and attended his local hospital.  
He w as placed on oxy gen and taken by  ambulance to a 
recompression chamber w here he received four sessions of 
treatment. 
March 2009 09/280 
Three divers conducted a dive to 27m and then followed a 
profile of slow ly declining depth back to 5m where they spent 
about 12 min.  They then spent 1 min at 3m and surfaced 
slowly.  After the dive one of the three felt dizzy  and nauseous.  
He had a meal and something to drink.  He rested for 1 hour but 
the sy mptoms remained so he declined a second dive.  He 
developed bad chest pains.  Later that evening he began to feel 
nauseous again and he had a tingly sensation in his hand and 
elbow and pain in his elbow .  He sought diving medical advice 
and attended a recompression facility  where he received 
treatment which alleviated his symptoms. 
April 2009 09/095 
Humber Coastguard arranged evacuation for a diver who had 
missed stops from 22m.  The vessel took their ow n medical 
advice from the duty  navy  doctor w ho initially  recommended 
evacuation to the nearest A&E as a precaution.   However, the 
diver's condition deteriorated and he had to be evacuated by 
rescue helicopter 131 to the hyperbaric unit at Aberdeen Roy al 
Infirmary for treatment for DCI.  Seahouses Coastguard met the 
helicopter at the hospital to assist w ith the transfer.  The dive 
boat failed to follow proper procedures when they contacted the 
duty diving doctor directly and by not informing the Coastguard 
immediately.  By  contacting t he Coastguard immediately  they 
can consult medical authorities and prevent any delays by 
arranging immediate and sw ift evacuation for treatment.  
(Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
April 2009 09/442 
The Coastguard w as alerted after a diver made a rapid ascent 
from 29m.  Diving medical advice w as sought and a lifeboat 
was launched to provide oxygen.  The diver w as brought 
ashore and w as then taken by  ambulance and helicopter to a 
recompression chamber for treatment of DCI.  (Coastguard 
report). 
April 2009 09/129 
A diver conducted a 47 min dive to a maximum depth of 25m.  4 
hours later he dived to 16m for 50 min.  The following day, 18 
hours later, he dived to 32m for 38 min with a 4 min stop at 5m.  
Once back in the boat he stumbled w hile w alking across the 
deck to de-kit.  Soon afterwards he sat down and noticed a pain 
in his back and numbness and tingling in both his legs.  He was 
placed on oxygen, diving medi cal advice w as sought and the 
boat headed back to harbour.  He was taken to hospital where a 
neurological DCI w as diagnosed and he w as recompressed.  
The diver had had a back injury  as a child w hich occasionally  
caused him periods of pai n and he had been diagnosed w ith a 
PFO following a DCI incident two and a half y ears earlier; this 
PFO had been closed at the time of the first incident. 
April 2009 09/103 
A diver conducted a 5 min dive to a depth of 6m playing the part 
of the casualty  in a controlled buoy ant lift exercise.  2 hours 
later he dived w ith an instructor and another diver to conduct a 
search for a lost w eightbelt.  They  deployed a shot in 16m and 
found the weightbelt after 5 min.  The diver w as then assessed 
on his ability to recover the shot and then to deploy  a delay ed 
SMB, mid-water, at a depth of 10m.  His first attempt failed but 
during his second attempt he held on to the delayed SMB too 
long and started to rise w ith it.  When he realised that he was 
making a rapid ascent he let go of the buoy but he was only 1m 
from the surface when he halted his ascent.  He then ascended 
to the surface with a dive duration of 25 min.  The other tw o 
divers were unable to prevent his rapid ascent; they  ascended 
normally.  He was monitored for sy mptoms for the rest of the 
day but none were detected.  Overnight the diver developed 
'pins and needles' in his hands and these continued into the 
morning after the dive.  Divi ng medical advice was sought and 
monitoring was continued.  Later that day the 'pins and needles' 
got worse and the diver w as airlifted to a recompression facility 
for two sessions of treatment. 
April 2009 09/314 
Three divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 16m.  
They were unable to locate the w reck they intended to dive on 
and they surfaced after 15 min.  Some time later one of the 
divers was involved in carry ing equipment up and dow n a long 
slipway.  He started to develop a headache whilst smoking a 
cigarette.  He was advised to stop smoking and to sit down.  He

then started to suffer from dizziness and blurred vision and he 
was placed on oxy gen.  An ambulance w as called and he w as 
taken to hospital.  Neurological DCI w as diagnosed and the 
diver was taken to a r ecompression facility for treatment which 
fully resolved his symptoms. 
April 2009 09/100 
The Coastguard was alerted after a diver developed symptoms 
of DCI follow ing a rapid ascent from a dive to 28m.  His dive 
duration was 33 min.  The diver was airlifted to a recompression 
facility for treatment.  The diver's integral weighting system was 
knocked during the dive allow ing w eights to fall free, thus 
causing a buoyant ascent.  (Coastguard report). 
April 2009 09/101 
A 51 y ear old diver w as airlifted from a dive boat to the 
Aberdeen Royal Infirmary by RN rescue helicopter R137.  The 
diver was suffering from DCI follow ing a dive to 48m.  
(Coastguard & RNLI reports).

A diver w as admitted to the recompression chamber in the 
evening.  He had developed DCI following a day's diving.  
(Coastguard report). 
April 2009 09/130 
A rebreather diver completed a series of nine dives the last of 
which was to 37m for 62 min including a 3 min stop at 9m, a 3 
min stop at 6m and a 10 min stop at 3m.  75 min after surfacing 
from this dive he developed a skin rash and an itching on the 
left side of his chest.  This rash developed a blue fringe, the 
diver was placed on oxygen and the Coastguard w as alerted.  
The boat returned to harbour and the diver w as taken to a 
recompression facility .  DCI w as diagnosed and the diver was 
recompressed; this resolved his symptoms.

A diver conducted a 36 min dive to a maximum depth of 31m 
with a 3 min stop at 6m.  Shortly  afterwards she complained of 
a pain in her low er back.  She then began to feel unw ell and 
nauseous.  Once ashore she w as unable to w alk w ithout 
support and she felt dizzy  and her legs w ere numb.  She w as 
placed on oxygen and given w ater to drink.  Diving medical 
advice w as sought and the diver w as transported to a 
recompression facility.  She w as given a ser ies of 
recompression treatments over subsequent day s and her 
symptoms improved but, at the time of reporting, her balance 
remained disturbed.  A vestibular DCI w as diagnosed.  The 
casualty had given birth 10 months previously.

Holyhead Coastguard received a request from a boat to 
evacuate a diver with 'pins & needles' and numbness in one leg 
following missed stops on a dive to 54m; the buddy  completed 
all their stops.  Rescue helicopter R-122 was tasked to airlift the 
diver to a hy perbaric chamber in Thingw all for treatment.  
Hoylake Coastguard met the helicopter at the HLS and assisted 
with transfer into an ambulance to go to the hyperbaric 
chamber.  (Coastguard report).

Falmouth Coastguard received a call from a dive boat reporting 
a diver onboard with a strong pain in his elbow  following a dive 
to 80m.  He w as initially  reported as slowly recovering, 
however, it w as subsequently necessary to airlift him to DDRC 
Plymouth for treatment.  Lizard AWLB, w ith a doctor onboard, 
proceeded to initially assess and transfer the diver from the dive 
boat prior to him being airlifted by  rescue helicopter R-193 to 
the hyperbaric chamber.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
May 2009 09/120 
A trimix rebreather diver undertook a dive to a maximum depth 
of 58m.  After a dive time of 25 min she started her ascent.  Her 
ascent progressed normally , including the necessary  stops, 
until she reached a depth of 12m.  At this depth her BCD fully 
inflated and carried her to the surface, missing stops.  It is 
thought that the inflation valve w as knocked or stuck open; she 
did not inflate it herself.  She w as placed on oxygen and the 
Coastguard was alerted.  She was airlifted to a recompression 
facility.  At the chamber her condition initially deteriorated but 
she recovered well after treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2009 09/141 
Shetland Coastguard received a call from a dive boat reporting 
that they  had a diver onboard w ho had suffered a blackout at 
depth and had a headache, but initially had no other symptoms.

min stop at 23m, a 2 min stop at 15m and a 4 min stop at 6m.  
Shortly after re-entering the boat, one of the pair noticed a pain 
in her upper abdomen; this w as thought to be due to her kit 
pressing on her.  A little later she developed an itching 
sensation in the area and signs of a skin DCI w ere found.  
Diving medical advice w as sought and although she had no 
neurological symptoms she was recompressed.  She had had a 
PFO closed nine y ears earlier and a subsequent examination 
indicated that the closure was still in place. 
June 2009 09/152 
Three divers conducted a 38 min dive to a maximum depth of 
30m with a 4 min stop at 6m.  Later that day one of the three 
noticed a dull ache in his left wrist.  Over the next two hours the 
pain got worse and spread to become a deep pain in the joint 
and across the back of his hand.  The follow ing morning the 
wrist was very painful and he sought  diving medical advice.  He 
was recompressed and the pain resolved w ithin 5 min of 
reaching 18m.  He received tw o further sessions of 
recompression treatment.

A trainee and an instructor conducted a wreck dive to a 
maximum depth of 22m.  The trainee felt seasick prior to the 
dive and was sick while kitting up.  After 26 min the dive leader 
deployed a delayed SMB and they started to make their ascent.  
During the ascent they  lost control of their buoy ancy and rose 
quickly to the surface missing a planned safety stop.  Their dive 
duration was 29 min.  Once back in the boat the trainee was 
sick again.  During the return journey  the trainee remained 
unwell and developed 'pins and needles' although not all of the 
dive party was aware of this.  Once back in the harbour it 
became clear that the trainee was quite unwell; the emergency  
services were alerted and she was placed on oxygen.  She was 
transferred to a recompression facility  and received five 
sessions of recompression treatment over a three day period. 
June 2009 09/156 
A pair of rebreather divers conducted a 109 min dive to a 
maximum depth of 67m.  One of the pair awoke early the 
following morning w ith numb and tingling fingers that quickly 
turned into a pain.  The pain spread to his w rist and elbow.  He 
placed himself on oxy gen and this  helped.  He contacted a 
recompression facility  and w as advised to attend immediately .  
He received a series of four recompression treatments and w as 
left with a slight tingling in the tips of two fingers. 
June 2009 09/176 
Two divers conducted a drift dive  in a maximum depth of 18m.  
During the dive one of the pair suffered from buoy ancy control 
problems with air migrating into the boots of his drysuit.  On one 
occasion he made a buoyant ascent up to 8m before the dive 
leader could reach him and assist him back to the seabed in a 
depth of 15m.  They  then made a normal ascent w ith a 4 min 
safety stop at 6m.  Their dive duration w as 35 min.  Later that 
day the diver who had had the buoyancy problems developed a 
headache.  The following morning the headache was worse and 
he had aches in his muscles and joints.  He contacted a 
recompression facility  and he w as advised to go to see them.  
He w as given a session of recompression treatment which 
resolved his symptoms.  It w as suggested that he may  have a 
PFO and he was seeking further medical advice. 
June 2009 09/202 
A diver conducted a 35 min dive to a maximum depth of 35m 
with a 6 min stop at 6m.  About 10 min after surfacing the diver 
was bending down when he felt giddy , he then collapsed w ith 
violent giddiness and retching.  The Coastguard w as alerted, 
the diver w as placed on oxy gen and then airlifted to a 
recompression chamber.  A vestibular DCI w as diagnosed and 
he received a  series of five recompression treatments over the 
following four days.  It w as a further three weeks before he felt 
fully recovered.  It is thought that stress, rushing to prepare, 
heatstroke and dehydration were contributory aspects. 
June 2009 09/184 
An ambulance attended a diver who was thought to be suffering 
from sy mptoms of DCI follow ing a rapid ascent from 16m.

25m for a drift dive.  At a depth of 23m she lost contact w ith her 
buddy and started to panic.  She tried to ascend slow ly but at 
14m she inflated her BCD instead of dumping air.  She made a 
rapid ascent to the surface.  She developed a tingling in her left 
hand and a pain in her left shoulder.  The Coastguard was 
alerted and the diver was airlifted to a recompression facility  for 
treatment which resolved her symptoms.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2009 09/204 
A diver conducted a 37 min dive to 34m, then, about 4 hours 30 
min later she dived to 32m for 40 min.  The follow ing day she 
dived to 44m for 40 min.  1 hour 15 min later she felt an itching 
across her shoulders and a rash w as found.  She w as placed 
on oxygen, given water and divi ng medical advice was sought.  
She w as kept under observation, the rash subsided and no 
further action was required.

A diver under training conducted a 24 min dive to a maximum 
depth of 9m then, after a surface interval of 15 min, a 15 min 
dive to a maximum depth of 10m.  During these two dives he 
practised rescue skills including controlled buoyant lifts, tow ing 
and the use of an alternative air source.  Later that day  he 
noticed a numbness and visual disturbances.  He sought diving 
medical advice and received recompression treatment that fully  
resolved his symptoms.

A pair of divers conducted a 40 min dive to a maximum depth of 
52m.  1 hour 25 min later they  dived to a maximum depth of 
42m.  As they made their return swim, at a depth of 25m, one of 
the pair inhaled a mouthful of w ater from his regulator.  He 
switched to his pony cylinder and breathed very  hard from this 
which caused it to free flow; he made a rapid ascent to the 
surface.  His buddy did not see this happen and w hen he 
realised that the diver was not with him he returned to depth to 
check.  He then surfaced and found the diver at the surface 
swimming for the shore.  He swam to him and asked him w hat 
the problem was; he did not get a coherent answ er and he 
towed the troubled diver to the shore.  The troubled diver w as 
still not very  coherent, claiming that there was no problem but 
not acting normally .  The rescuing diver helped him from the 
water and placed him in the recovery  position then w ent to 
phone the emergency  services.  The casualty was airlifted to a 
recompression chamber but released later that day  w ith no 
signs of DCI found.  The casualty  had no memory of the events 
from after he surfaced until the paramedics arrived to treat him.

Shortly after getting back on the boat he felt dizzy  and 
experienced back pains.  He breathed nitrox 31 until 100% 
oxygen was made available.  The Coastguard w as alerted and 
the boat headed back to harbour.  The diver's back pain 
resolved after about  10 min on oxy gen but he then became 
nauseous and w as violently  sick.  Once ashore the diver was 
taken by  ambulance to a r ecompression facility  w here he 
received three sessions of recompression treatment for 
vestibular and spinal DCI. 
July 2009 09/234 
A pair of divers conducted a dive  to a maximum depth of 33m.  
After 33 min one of the pair deploy ed a delayed SMB and they  
began their ascent.  During the ascent the diver w ho was not 
holding the SMB lost control of his buoyancy and was carried to 
the surface from 10m missing 16 min of stops.  He w as 
recovered into the boat and placed on oxygen.  The Coastguard 
was alerted and the diver w as airlifted to a recompression 
facility for treatment of DCI.  His buddy ascended normally.  The 
diver w as using a new  tw in-set configuration and had not 
adjusted his weight correctly.  He had assumed that they would 
ascend the shotline but they could not find it in low visibility.

July 2009 09/237 
A pair of divers descended to the seabed at a depth of 26m to 
conduct a drift dive.  They carried an SMB and had a buddy line 
to connect themselves together.  There w as a strong current 
and they  became tangled in the lines.  One of the divers had 
her regulator pulled from her mouth and she reached for her 
octopus regulator but picked up her pony  regulator instead.  
They were unable to untangle themselves so they  started to 
ascend.  During the ascent the SMB reel jammed and the other 
diver started to sink back down.  His buddy put some air into his 
BCD and they  both rose to the surface.  The diver who had 
sunk back was hyperventilating and, concerned that they might 
run out of air, they missed planned stops.  Once in the boat the 
diver who had been hy perventilating showed signs of DCI so 
the skipper alerted the Coastguard.  Both divers w ere taken by  
helicopter and  ambulance to a r ecompression facility  for 
treatment. 
July 2009 09/197 
Two divers descended to a w reck at a depth of 25m.  Visibility  
was very poor and one of the pair indicated that she w anted to 
abort the dive.  They  ascended to 14m at w hich point the 
troubled diver started to panic.  Her buddy  tried to slow  her but 
she kicked free and made a rapid a scent to 6m.  Other divers 
were still descending the shotline and the troubled diver held on 
to one of them tightly  before losing consciousness.  She started 
to sink back down and one of the other divers caught hold of 
her and brought her to the surface.   
She was recovered into the boat and it w as found that she w as 
not breathing and had no apparent pulse.  Resuscitation 
techniques were applied and the Coastguard was alerted.  The 
casualty started breathing spontaneously  within a few  minutes.  
She was airlifted to hospital w here an arterial gas embolism as 
a result of a burst lung w as diagnosed.  She was transferred to 
a recompression chamber for treatment and was discharged the 
following day .  A week later she had residual sy mptoms of 
headache, some nausea and aches in her left thigh.  She had 
no memory  of the period from 10 min before the dive to the 
following day.

min later he dived to 24m for 39 min w ith a 3 min stop at 6m.  
Shortly after surfacing he noticed a pain in his upper right arm; 
initially he thought that this w as a muscular strain.  Later the 
pain increased and he w as placed on oxy gen and diving 
medical advice was sought.  The pain increased further and the 
diver attended a recompression facility.  He w as recompressed 
and his symptoms resolved.

A diver conducted a 59 min dive to 15m w ith a 3 min stop at 
6m.  3 hours 21 min later she dived to 16m for 69 min w ith a 3 
min stop at 6m.  The following day she dived to 18m for 62 min 
with a 5 min stop at 6m, then, 3 hours 11 min later to 13m for 67 
min with a 3 min stop at 6m.  Later that day she noticed a slight 
tingling in her left hand; this sensation had gone when she 
awoke that night.  Early  the following morning she awoke lying 
on the arm and had 'pins and needles' in her hand and arm, 
however this did not fully  resolve when she moved her position.  
She continued to experience a s light tingling in her left hand 
and later that morning she sought  diving medical advice.  She 
attended a recompression chamber and was given three 
sessions of recompression treatment.  This treatment left the 
casualty concerned that the sy mptoms may not have been fully  
resolved.

Three divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 24m.  
One of the pair was using a new mask and this kept misting up 
throughout the dive.  He began to feel ill and indicated to his 
buddies that he wanted to ascend, he then vomited through his 
regulator.  This combined w ith his fogged up mask and low  
underwater visibility caused him to panic.  He inflated his BCD 
and made a rapid ascent to the surface.  Once at the surface he 
calmed down.  Later that day  he began to w orry about DCI and 
he sought diving medical advice by  phone, he w as advised to

call back if he developed sy mptoms.  During the night he 
developed a pain in his arm and numb fingers.  He re-contacted 
the medical advice and w as told to attend a local 
recompression facility.  He r eceived tw o sessions of 
recompression treatment.  He believes that a large, fried 
breakfast shortly  before the subject dive w as a contributory  
factor to him feeling unwell.

were met by  Poole CRT and an ambulance for transfer to the 
hyperbaric chamber at Poole.  Following the hyperbaric 
treatment the diver was still unw ell so he w as tr ansferred to 
hospital for further assessment and treatment.  He received two 
sessions of treatment for a vestibular DCI.  The diver had 
conducted a similar dive the day before.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2009 09/364 
Clyde Coastguard received a 999 call from a dive boat reporting 
that they  had a diver w ho w as display ing signs of DCI more 
than 2 hours after surfacing from a dive.  Medical advice w as 
that the diver should be evacuat ed to a hyperbaric chamber for 
assessment as a precaution.  The boat returned ashore where 
they were met by Loch Aline CRT for transfer to Oban AWLB so 
they could take him to the hyperbaric chamber at Dunstaffnage.  
(Coastguard report). 
August 2009 09/257 
Brixham Coastguard received a ca ll from a dive boat reporting 
they had a diver onboard who had made an uncontrolled ascent 
and was show ing signs of DCI.  Medical advice taken from a 
dive doctor w as that she s hould evacuated to a hyperbaric 
chamber.  Ply mouth AWLB proceeded to stand by  the boat 
while the diver w as airlifted by  rescue helicopter R-193.  The 
diver was taken to the HLS where he was met by an ambulance 
for transfer to the hy perbaric chamber at DDRC Ply mouth.  
(Coastguard report). 
August 2009 09/255 
A rebreather and an open circuit di ver conducted a dive to a 
maximum depth of 29m.  After about 24 min the rebreather 
diver deploy ed a delay ed SMB for their ascent.  The open 
circuit diver caught his mask strap on the SMB line and w hile 
sorting this problem out he ascended a few  metres.  Despite 
venting air he became positively buoy ant and w as carried 
directly to the surface missing 2 min of mandatory 
decompression stops.  His ascent took about 1 min.  The 
rebreather diver followed him but more slow ly, he paused for a 
few seconds at 6m before surfacing.  Once back on the boat the 
diver who had made the buoyant ascent was placed on oxygen 
and the rebreather diver breathed oxy gen from his set.  Diving 
medical advice w as sought and the Coastguard was alerted.  
The boat was met by an ambulance back in the harbour and the 
two diver s w ere taken to a r ecompression facility.  The diver 
who had made the buoy ant ascent w as found to have slight 
balance problems and he w as recompressed.  He made a full 
recovery and doubts w ere expressed about the cause being 
DCI.  This diver had recently  sw itched from using his BCD to 
using only his suit for buoyancy control. 
August 2009 09/256 
Dover Coastguard received a call from a dive boat reporting 
they were on their w ay back to harbour and had a diver w ho 
was show ing signs of DCI shor tly after surfacing follow ing a 
normal ascent.  Medical advice w as that the diver should be 
taken to a hyperbaric chamber.  The boat was met on return by  
an ambulance and Eastbourne CRT for airlift by  rescue 
helicopter R-104 to the hy perbaric chamber at Whipps Cross 
hospital London.  (Coastguard report).

A diver suffering from serious DCI w as treated in a 
recompression chamber.  (Media report). 
August 2009 09/269 
A diver conducted a 43 min dive to 24m w ith a 2 min stop at 
14m and a 2 min stop at 6m.  The diver had experienced some 
problems w ith ear clearing during the descent and traces of 
blood were visible in his mask on surfacing.  Shortly  after 
surfacing he complained of pain and tightness in his chest and 
midriff w hen breathing.  The casualty  was given water, laid 
down and placed on oxy gen.  The Coastguard w as alerted and 
the boat returned to harbour.  The casualty developed 'pins and 
needles' in his left hand.  He w as taken to hospital, kept in 
overnight and discharged the follow ing day; the diagnosis was 
'trapped air in gut'.  The casualty  still felt unwell and he 
developed 'pins and needles' in his legs during the day .  The 
following day he went with his buddy to a recompression facility, 
by this time he w as also having balance problems.  He w as 
given recompression treatment and a mild DCI w as diagnosed.  
It w as thought that the original pain was unrelated.  The 
casualty w as left w ith mild 'pins and needles' in his legs and 
these symptoms resolved during subsequent days.

Forth Coastguard received a call from the ambulance service 
reporting that they had received a call about a diver ashore who 
was suffering from tingling in the fingers follow ing his dive.  
Eyemouth CRT proceeded to assist and the diver w as airlifted 
to the hyperbaric chamber at Aberdeen Roy al Infirmary  by  
rescue helicopter R-177.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2009 09/306 
A pair of divers conducted a dive  to a maximum depth of 29m.  
They deploy ed a delay ed SMB to make their ascent.  Their 
ascent was faster than intended and at 10m they stopped and 
re-descended to 15m to regain control.  At this point one of the 
pair moved aw ay from the SMB line and seemed to have a 
problem with his mask.  He signalled that he was not happy and 
wanted to ascend and then made directly  for the surface.  The 
other diver made a more normal ascent, completing stops at 6m 
and 3m.  Once back in the boat the diver w ho had made the 
rapid ascent and missed stops w as placed on oxy gen.  The 
Coastguard w as alerted and the diver w as airlifted to a 
recompression facility for treatment.

Two divers conducted a drift dive  to a maximum depth of 24m.  
After 30 min they  made a normal ascent w ith a 3 min safety  
stop at 6m.  Their total dive time w as 37 min.  Shortly  after 
getting back into the boat one of the pair experienced a pain in 
her lower ribs. This pain w orsened, she developed a 'strange 
sensation' in her feet and low er legs and felt as is she w as 
about to pass out.  She lay down and w as placed on oxy gen.  
The boat returned to harbour and the diver's condition 
improved.  Once ashore she s ought diving medical advice via 
the Coastguard.  She w as airlifted to a recompression chamber 
where she was successfully treated for DCI.  The casualty  had 
been involved in a car accident 6 months earlier during which 
she lost consciousness; it w as suggested that tissue scarring 
from this previous accident had left an area prone to bubble 
formation. 
August 2009 09/262 
A diver completed a six day  diving programme w ith depths 
down to 40m.  On her last day , using nitrox 25, she dived to 
38m for 28 min with a 7 min stop at 6m.  2 hours later she dived 
to 29m for 49 min with a 16 min stop at 6m.  Shortly  after this 
last dive the diver mentioned an itchy  feeling on her skin and a 
circular bruise was found; this spread to become a rash.  The 
diver was placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was contacted.   
 
 
The boat was in harbour and an ambulance and doctor 
attended.  The doctor diagnosed an allergic reaction and 
administered an anti-histamine drug.  One of the other divers 
suggested that it could be DCI and persuaded the doctor to 
seek diving medical advice.  T he diver was then airlifted to a 
recompression chamber w here treatment resolved her 
symptoms. 
September 2009 09/374 
Belfast Coastguard received a call from a dive centre reporting 
that one of their boats w as returning to shore with a diver 
onboard who was complaining of symptoms of DCI.  Ballycastle 
CRT and an ambulance w ere sent to meet the boat and w hen 
they arrived medical advice w as taken from a dive doctor.  The 
doctor recommended immediate transfer to Craigavon 
hyperbaric chamber, so the diver w as taken by  ambulance.  
(Coastguard report). 
September 2009 09/270 
Two trimix divers using a 21/35 mix conducted a dive to 45m for 
77 min including 27 min of decom pression stops during w hich 
one diver used nitrox 50 and the other used nitrox 60.  The 
following day they dived to 40m for 70 min including 32 min of 
stops, using the same gases as the previous day .  During the 
decompression stops one of the pair noticed a pain in her left 
elbow.  Upon surfacing the pain w as still present and she was 
placed on oxy gen.  The other diver then reported that he felt 
dizzy.  The Coastguard was alerted and the divers were airlifted 
to hospital.  During the flight the diver w ho had become dizzy 
suffered from low  blood oxygen concentration and diminished 
consciousness, he also developed altered sensation in his legs.  
Both divers w ere given reco mpression treatment.  The first 
casualty exhibited only  mild sy mptoms of pain, the second 
casualty had vestibular and addi tional neurological sy mptoms 
and he required further sessions of treatment.  It w as 
recommended that this casualty  should be tested for a PFO.  
(Coastguard report). 
September 2009 09/378 
Shetland Coastguard received a call from a dive boat with a 
diver onboard who had a dilated pupil following a deep dive with 
a normal profile and display ing no other signs or sy mptoms of 
DCI.  The boat returned to harbour to be met by Stromness 
CRT who assisted with the transfer by ambulance to Stromness 
hyperbaric chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2009 09/273 
Two pairs of divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 
34m.  At the end of their dive they  ascended a shotline.  There 
were other divers on the line and a current w as running.  At 
15m they found the shot buoy , pulled dow n by the drag of the 
divers in the current.  They were pulled down to the seabed at a 
depth of 34m.  One pair left the line and ascended, at 6m they 
deployed a delayed SMB but sank back to 14m in the process.  
One of the divers w as now low on air and had difficulty  staying 
down, he surfaced having completed 2 min of an indicated 7 
min stop, his buddy  also had buoy ancy problems and she 
surfaced missing 4 min of st ops.  The second pair became 
separated from each other w hen one released the sunken 
shotline and the other didn't.  This other diver made a rapid 
ascent directly to the surface.  The diver who had released the 
line made a normal ascent including all necessary stops.  Back 
in the boat the diver w ho had made the rapid ascent was 
diagnosed with symptoms of DCI and the diver who had missed 
4 min of stops developed a slight numbness in her left hand and 
a pain in her thumb.  The other two divers were monitored for 
signs of DCI but none were found.  The Coastguard was alerted 
and a lifeboat was launched to assist.  The two divers who had

September 2009 09/310 symptoms received recompression treatment; the diver w ho 
had made the rapid ascent required two sessions. 
A diver conducted a series of dives over a three day period.  On 
the third day, after an 18 hour surface interval, he dived to 39m 
for 39 min w ith a 1 min stop at 6m and a 22 min stop at 3m.  
About 40 min after surfacing he started to feel vertigo and this 
led to nausea and sickness.  The Coastguard was alerted and 
the diver was placed on nitrox 79.   The diver w as taken ashore 
and then transferred to a recompression chamber by 
ambulance.  He received four sessions of recompression 
treatment over a four day period.

had already  returned ashore, reporting they  had a diver w ho 
had missed stops and w as reported as having been 
unconscious w hile underw ater, but w as show ing no signs or 
symptoms of DCI.  Medical advice from a dive doctor w as that 
the diver should initially  be air lifted to hospital.  Amble CRT 
assisted with transferring the diver to rescue helicopter R-131 
which flew  him to hospital w here he w as met by  Hull CRT to 
assist with the transfer to hospital by  ambulance.  He w as later 
transferred to Hull hy perbaric chamber for treatment.  
(Coastguard report). 
Milford Haven Coastguard received a 'Pan Pan' urgency  call 
from a dive boat on their way back to shore with two divers who 
were feeling unwell follow ing their dive.  Medical advice taken 
from Aberdeen Roy al Infirmary  was that the divers should be 
airlifted immediately for treat ment.   Rescue helicopter R-169 
airlifted the divers to the hy perbaric chamber at DDRC 
Plymouth for treatment.  (Coastguard report).

requesting an airlift for a diver with DCI.  The diver w as airlifted 
by rescue helicopter R-131 to Hull hy perbaric chamber for 
treatment.  Berwick & Hull CRTs assisted at the helicopter 
landing sites at the hospital and hy perbaric chamber.  
(Coastguard report). 
September 2009 09/394 
Brixham Coastguard received a request for medical advice from 
a dive group ashore.  They  had a diver w ho was showing signs 
of a skin DCI.  They had already  tried to contact DDRC 
Plymouth themselves but had failed to get through.  Brixham 
contacted the duty doctor and put them in direct contact with the 
diver, who did not need treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2009 09/309 
A diver completed a series of dives over a number of days.  On 
the day of the incident he dived to 38m for 27 min w ith a 2 min  
stop at 9m, a 3 min stop at 6m and a 1 min stop at 3m.  3 hours 
10 min later he dived to 36m fo r 36 min including a 1 min  stop 
at 9m, a 4 min stop at 6m and a 2 min stop at 3m.  Once back 
in the boat he got out of his dry suit and started to get changed.  
At this point he became unw ell; colour drained from his face 
and he became lethargic.  A doctor w ho was on a nearby  boat 
attended the casualty , he w as placed on oxygen and the 
Coastguard was alerted.  The boat returned to shore and the 
diver was taken to hospital for tests as there w as concern that 
he might have had a heart attack.  No sign of heart attack w as 
found and the diver w as transferred to a recompression 
chamber for treatment.  The diver was very weak and unable to 
walk into the chamber.  The diver had a further session of 
recompression treatment.  He had previously suffered from DCI. 
September 2009 09/312 
A diver conducted a 26 min dive to 30m w ith a 3 min stop at 
6m.  2 hours later he dived to 25m for 33 min with a 3 min stop 
at 6m.  About 30 min after the second dive he reported 'pins 
and needles' in both his legs.  The Coastguard was alerted and 
the diver w as placed on oxy gen.  Once ashore the diver was 
taken by ambulance to a r ecompression facility  where he was 
successfully treated for DCI.  It is reported that the diver's 
computer ascent rate alarm had activated a number of times 
during the ascent and it is thought that rapid ascent may have 
been a causal factor. 
September 2009 09/397 
Shetland Coastguard received a call from a dive boat reporting 
they were returning to harbour w ith a diver w ho w as feeling 
unwell follow ing a seemingly  normal dive profile.  They were

from 4m.  Transferred to chamber but no treatment needed. 
October 2008 09/061 
The Coastguard was alerted after a diver surfaced from an 18m 
dive feeling unwell.  She had swallowed some seawater and was 
a little hy pothermic, having over-e xerted herself during the dive.  
She was taken to hospital.  (Coastguard report). 
October 2008 09/009 
A diver conducted a 34 min dive to 32m including a 3 min stop at 
6m.  1 hour 53 min later he dived to 20m for 38 min w ith a 3 min 
stop at 6m.  Shortly after the second dive he felt unsteady  and 
sought advice.  He w as placed on oxygen for 20 min.  After this 
he felt fine and it is not thought that further action was taken.

A pair of divers conducted a dive  to a maximum depth of 20m.  
They w ere at a depth of 16m w hen they  became separated.  
They found each other again at a depth of 6m w here they 
conducted a 1 min safety  stop.  They  surfaced after a dive time 
of 32 min.  One of the pair was exhausted and a boat was 
launched to recover both divers.  The exhausted diver w as 
placed on oxygen but no further treatment was required. 
October 2008 09/444 
The casualty  w as setting up a scuba unit at poolside.  The 
casualty turned the air on, w hilst holding the high pressure hose 
near the first stage.  The high pressure hose burst in the 
casualty's hand causing a deep laceration which required first aid 
and transfer to the emergency services for sutures. 
October 2008 09/013 
A diver dived to a maximum depth of 26m but failed to equalise 
the pressure in his face mask.  He returned to the surface after a 
dive duration of 5 min and complained of blurred vision and 
severe swelling of his eyes.  The Coastguard w as alerted and 
medical advice w as sought.  Once ashore he w ent to hospital.

injury, she was holding on to the side of a dive boat.  A lifeboat 
was tasked to assist and the diver was transferred by ambulance 
to hospital.  (Coastguard report). 
November 2008 09/018 
A diver on her second dive in UK  waters conducted a dive to a 
maximum depth of 17m.  She suffered mask squeeze and as 
she tried to solve the problem she dislodged her mouthpiece and 
swallowed some water.  This caused her to panic and she made 
a rapid ascent to the surface.  She w as recovered into the boat 
but she was very distressed and was sick.  The Coastguard w as 
alerted and medical advice w as sought.  The diver slow ly 
recovered and no further action was required. 
November 2008 09/446 
The casualty cut her hand on a sharp tile in the pool.  She w as 
assisted out of the w ater and first aid was administered.  It was 
decided that the casualty needed medical assistance so she was 
transferred to see a nurse at a walk in centre. 
January 2009 09/448 
The casualty  completed a dive and after exit complained of 
feeling dizzy  and of nausea.  Oxy gen and first aid were 
administered.  He w as monitored for any  further sy mptoms and 
advised not to dive again that day. 
February 2009 09/036 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 30m.  He had 
been suffering from a cold and had taken Sudafed prior to the 
dive.  He experienced no problems during the descent but w hen 
he tried to ascend at the end of the dive he experienced pain in 
his right ear at 28m; this pain increased rapidly  w ith a small 
decrease in depth.  He re-descended, sw allowed a few times 
and then ascended much more slow ly.  He had no further 
problems during the rest of this dive and surfaced after a 
duration of 54 min.  Once out of the w ater he noticed that the 
hearing in his right ear w as badly impaired but put this down to 
trapped water.  2 hours 15 min later he dived to 20m for 60 min 
with no further problems.  On his way home he noticed a small 
amount of blood coming from his ear and a 'spongy' feeling 
developed in his face around the ear.  He w ent to his local 
hospital and w as referred to a specialist.  He saw  the specialist 
eight days after the dive and a small perforation of the eardrum 
was diagnosed.  The injury was healing well. 
February 2009 09/051 
The Coastguard w as alerted w hen a diver complained of 
breathing difficulties after a dive.  He was brought ashore by  his 
dive boat then taken to hospita l by ambulance.  (Coastguard 
report). 
March 2009 09/042 
A pair of divers conducted a dive  to a maximum depth of 18m.  
They had just turned to swim back to their exit point when one of 
the pair experienced a severe pain in her left knee.  She 
signalled to her buddy  that she had a problem, he took hold of 
her BCD and they  made a normal ascent to the surface; their 
dive duration was 26 min.  At the surface the diver explained the 
problem and that she could not fin.  Her buddy  towed her to the 
shore and she was assisted from the w ater.  She w as taken by  
ambulance to hospital.  The di ver had had an operation to repair 
a torn cruciate ligament in her left knee 6 y ears earlier and had 
been problem free since.  It w as not thought that the problem 
was caused by the dive. 
March 2009 09/451 
The casualty was completing an orientation dive of the site, her 
maximum depth was 6m.  Safety  stops were completed then, on 
surfacing, the casualty  complained of a headache and feeling 
queasy.  The casualty dekitted then said that the symptoms were 
worse.  First aid and oxy gen w ere administered.  She w as 
transferred to local hospital for check up; no further treatment.

March 2009 09/087 
Three divers entered the w ater in a harbour w ith the intention of 
locating an underw ater guideline.  They  swam a little off-course 
and after 33 min they  surfaced much further from the exit point 
than intended.  During the return surface sw im one of the four 
felt that he could not get enough air, he became distressed and 
removed his mask and mouthpiece.  One of the other divers 
assisted him and, as they  reached calmer w ater, the troubled 
diver regained composure.  They  all left the w ater safely and no 
subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
March 2009 09/088 
A trainee was on her third open water dive.  At one point she lost 
control of her buoyancy and surfaced too quickly  from a depth of 
about 10m.  After checking that she was alright the instructor and 
the trainee re-descended the shotline and continued to a depth 
of 13m.  They  then sw am up a gentle slope tow ards the exit 
point.  At 8m the instructor signalled the trainee to dump air 
using her BCD dump valve.  T he trainee moved into an upright 
position and the air in her suit started to lift her.  The instructor 
signalled that she should use her cuff dump but before she could 
do so she made a buoy ant ascent to the surface.  During the 
ascent she suffered a reversed ear and burst her left eardrum.  
Their dive duration was 25 min.  Once out of the w ater she was 
placed on oxy gen and diving medical advice w as sought.  She 
went to hospital where the burst eardrum w as confirmed.  The 
diver w as seeking further medical advice.  She had been on 
antihistamines follow ing what was thought to have been a dust 
allergy at work. 
March 2009 09/089 
A diver conducted a 37 min dive to a maximum depth of 20m 
with a 3 min stop at 6m.  3 hours later she dived to 19m.  During 
this dive, at a depth of 16m, the dive leader noticed that she 
appeared unwell; he gave her the OK signal and she indicated 
that all w as not w ell.  The dive leader noticed that the troubled 
diver's eyes seemed to be closing and he brought her to the 
surface using a controlled buoyant lift.  Their dive duration w as 
15 min.  At the surface the alarm w as raised and the diver w as 
recovered from the water.  She was placed on oxygen.  She was 
conscious at the surface but could not remember the last part of 
the dive.  The emergency  servic es w ere alerted and she was 
taken to hospital.  Her only  symptom was a severe headache.  
Once in hospital her condition deteriorated and she w as taken to 
a recompression facility for treatment.  Subsequent tests showed 
that this diver had a PFO. 
April 2009 09/096 
The Coastguard was alerted when a diver surfaced having made 
a rapid ascent from a dive to 34m.  His dive duration was 24 min.  
The diver could not clear his mask at depth and, after a few 
failed attempts, he decided to surface.  At 20m he could not see 
the dive computer clearly and, in his confusion, he lost control of 
his buoyancy and rose rapidly  to the surface.   Once in the boat 
his awareness level seemed to be impaired.  He w as placed on 
oxygen.  Diving medical advice w as sought and the diver was 
airlifted to a recompression facility  for precautionary  treatment.  
He was diagnosed with 'stomach bloating' thought to be due to 
him having ingested air duri ng the dive w hich expanded on 
ascent.  It is thought that nitrogen narcosis may have played a 
part in this incident.  (Coastguard report). 
April 2009 09/243 
A diver was at a depth of 26m using independent tw in cylinders.  
During the dive he sw itched to the second cy linder and 
experienced sickness, headache and dizziness.  He changed 
back to the first cy linder and aborted the dive.  His symptoms 
cleared within 30 min of surfacing.  He reports that there w as a 
taste to the air. 
April 2009 09/098 
Falmouth Coastguard received a report from a dive boat that 
they had a diver onboard w ho had surfaced and w as show ing 
signs of distress, had a grey  pallor and a severe headache 
following a second dive of the day .  A medi link call w as 
arranged with the duty  diving doctor at DDRC Ply mouth, w ho 
advised that the diver should be placed on oxy gen and both the 
diver and her buddy  should be transferred to the DDRC 
Plymouth by  ambulance for observation and treatment as soon 
as she returned ashore.  (Coastguard report). 
April 2009 09/452 
At a depth of 25m the casualty  was attempting 'out of air' drill 
when she placed her buddy 's regul ator in her mouth upside 
down.  She attempted to clear the regulator but then sw itched 
back to her own.  She struggled to clear the regulator so aborted 
dive.  At the surface the casualty  complained of pain.  Oxy gen 
was administered and the emergency services were contacted.

Diving at a depth of 3m the casualty 's fin w as bent back the 
wrong w ay and she signalled to the instructor that she had a 
problem w ith her chest. The inst ructor checked the casualty 's 
BCD.  The casualty wanted to ascend.  The group ascended and 
the casualty  complained of a shortness of breath and a pain in 
her ankle.  First aid w as admin istered and she was transferred 
for check up by the emergency services.

Portland Coastguard received a call for medical advice from a 
dive boat with a diver onboard w ho w as suffering dental pain 
following diving.  Medical advice from a dive doctor at Poole 
hyperbaric chamber w as that t he diver should attend hospital 
A&E as it seemed that the problem w as most likely dental 
trauma caused by air in a gap in a tooth.  (Coastguard report). 
April 2009 09/315 
A diver w as participating in an oxy gen administration and 
resuscitation course w hen he s uddenly collapsed onto the floor.  
He was sweating profusely  and had no visible sign of a pulse.  
After about 2 min he started fitting and then regained 
consciousness.  He w as very confused but stated that this had 
happened before.  An ambulance w as called and he w as taken 
to hospital.  The diver had not previously declared a medical 
problem.

A pair of divers entered the water from the shore and dived to a 
maximum depth of 7m.  During the dive they became 
disorientated and swam back towards a rocky shore.  One of the 
pair felt uneasy during the dive.  They  swam into a rocky  gully  
where the sw ell was surging in and out and they had to swim 
hard to get out again.  The diver who felt uneasy became 
exhausted and climbed onto a rock to rest.  Her buddy  signalled 
to her and she got back into the w ater to continue the sw im to 
the exit point.  She quickly became exhausted again and climbed 
onto another rock.  She signalled for help and other divers came 
to her and brought her ashore.  She received a cut to her shin 
which required hospital treatment.  It w as suggested that her 
semi-drysuit neck seal may  have been too tight and that this 
could have caused her exhaustion.

Falmouth Coastguard received a call from a dive boat requesting 
medical advice for a diver w ho had a sore shoulder follow ing a 
deep dive, with a normal ascent, although his shoulder was sore 
before the dive.  Medical advice from DDRC Plymouth was to 
give oxygen and for the boat to continue back to port. The diver 
was also advised to monitor his condition, calling DDRC again 
for advice if there was any further concern.  (Coastguard report).

After a dive to 13m the casualty  was seen being towed by his 
buddy on the surface.  He w as not breathing so rescuers 
removed him from the lake, commenced resuscitation and called 
the emergency services.  After approx 10 min the casualty began 
to breathe and gradually  regained consciousness.   Oxygen was 
administered, 
May 2009 09/136 
A pair of divers conducted a 28 mi n dive to a maximum depth of 
18m with a 4 min safety stop at 6m.  During the descent one of 
the pair felt his right ear suddenly  get colder and he heard a 
whistling sound in this ear during the dive.  After the dive he 
found that a discharge w as coming from this ear.  He sought 
diving medical advice and a perforated eardrum was diagnosed. 
May 2009 09/296 
A pair of divers entered the w ater to descend a shotline to a 
wreck in a maximum depth of 30m.  One of the pair missed the 
shotline and descended aw ay from the line.  The divers met up 
on the wreck and the dive leader noticed that the diver w ho had 
missed the line was very tense, his eyes were wide open and his 
fists were clenched.  The dive leader brought the troubled diver 
back up the shotline and they  made a 4 min stop on the w ay.  At 
the surface the troubled diver was confused and unable to help 
himself.  He w as recovered into the boat and placed on oxygen.  
He made a quick recovery  and no further action w as required.  
He could not explain his panic underw ater but had had little 
sleep the previous night and was exhausted. 
May 2009 09/456 
At a depth of 9m the casualty  lost his regulator in bad 
underwater visibility w hile the instructor w as helping another 
student.  The casualty  w ould not accept the instructor's 
alternative air source so the instructor made an emergency 
ascent with the casualty .  On the surface the casualty  
complained of chest pain so oxy gen was administered and the 
emergency services w ere called.  No further actions w ere 
needed after examination. 
May 2009 09/138 
A diver entered the w ater from a boat by rolling in backwards 
from the side.  His buddy  followed him and landed on top of him.  
The first diver received a severe cut to the top of his head.  Once 
ashore he was taken to hospital where six stitches were required 
to close the wound. 
May 2009 09/146 
Solent Coastguard received a call from ambulance control 
advising that they had received a call regarding a diver w ho had 
surfaced shortly after her descent, w as feeling sick and dizzy  
and coughing up blood.  She had dived to 11m.  Rescue 
helicopter CG 104 was tasked to evacuate the diver.  It w as met 
at the landing site by  an ambulance and Poole CRT and the 
diver was transferred to the hyperbaric chamber for treatment.  It 
transpired that the call to the ambulance w as made by  an 
unknown person.  On discussion w ith the diver's club it w as 
discovered that this was her first open w ater dive and she had 
surfaced with blood in her mask which was considered to due to 
mask squeeze and nothing w as done about it.  The club was 
advised that if a person display s symptoms of any sort following 
a dive, however minor, it should be reported to the Coastguard 
for medical advice.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2009 09/457 
The casualty completed a dive w ithout incident and made a 3 
min safety stop.  On the surface the casualty  could not see the 
dive boat and she became panicked and short of breath.  She 
was assisted into a boat as she w as exhausted.  Oxy gen was 
administered and the casualty w as recompressed as a 
precaution. 
June 2009 09/458 
The casualty completed a dive w ith no issues.   Some time later 
he was putting on his undersuit w hen he complained of a painful 
hand w hich w ent into a cramp like spasm.  He complained of 
feeling sick so oxy gen was administered.  The casualty moved 
his hand until it clicked and he then felt better.   He was advised 
to see his doctor. 
June 2009 09/203 
Four divers conducted a shore dive to a maximum depth of 12m.  
There w as a strong current and one of the three became 
separated from the group.  After a short search for the missing 
diver the three surfaced.  The missing diver also surfaced and 
made his way back to shore.  The shore line was rocky and wave 
action made his exit difficult.  He slipped and fell on his right 
shoulder.  He w ent to the local A&E w here an undisplaced 
fracture of the head of his humerus was diagnosed. 
June 2009 09/316 
A diver conducted three dives in a day  and tw o dives on the 
second day.  On day  two he dived to 27m for 33 min with stops 
of 2 min at 9m, 3 min at 6m and 5 min at 3m on his ascent.  2 
hours 10 min later he dived to 28m for 32 min w ith a 3 min stop 
at 9m, a 3 min stop at 6m and a 3 min stop at 3m.  Shortly after 
arriving back on shore he complained of a numbness from above 
his right knee to his foot.  He was given water to drink, placed on 
oxygen and the Coastguard w as alerted.  Diving medical advice 
was sought by phone and the diver was asked to carry out some 
balance tests.  During this time the numbness eased.  It was 
thought unlikely that he had DCI but he w as advised to attend a 
hospital for examination, this he did.  No DCI was found and the 
diver was released. 
June 2009 09/343 
Yarmouth Coastguard received a call from a dive boat w ith a 
diver onboard w ho had suffered a badly  cut finger while on a 
wreck dive, despite w earing gloves.  The boat returned to shore 
and the diver w as met by Happisburg CRT and Sea Palling ILB.  
He w as taken to hospital by  ambulance for treatment.  
(Coastguard report).

June 2009 09/459 
At a depth of 9m the casualty  began mask clearing practice but 
he started to panic and spat his regulator out.  The instructor 
tried to replace his regulator but the casualty  made a rapid 

 
 
NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2009    
ascent to the surface.  He complained of severe headaches so 
the emergency services were called.  Oxy gen was administered 
and the casualty was taken to hospital for further examination. 
June 2009 09/180 
Two divers entered the water to dive a w reck.  The first diver 
descended the shotline but, as the second diver started to 
descend, the shot buoy  hit his regulator knocking it from his 
mouth.  This diver was breathing in at the time and he inhaled a 
quantity of seawater.  He was able to retrieve his regulator but it 
was dislodged again and he took in further mouthfuls of water.  
He quickly became distressed and was in danger of sinking.  The 
skipper alerted the Coastguard and approached the struggling 
diver.  A line w as thrown to him but he w as unable to grasp it.  
The boat approached again and again the diver w as unable to 
grab the line.  Another diver jumped in to assist but was unable 
to get the regulator back into the struggling diver's mouth.  
Eventually they  were able to manoeuvre the diver to the boat's 
diver lift and he was removed from the w ater.  Once in the boat 
he was placed in the recovery  position and given oxy gen.  He 
quickly recovered.  His buddy waited for him at the bottom of the 
shotline but resurfaced once he realised that his buddy was not 
going to join him.  The troubled diver w as airlifted to hospital 
because of fears of secondary  drowning.  He was released, fully 
recovered, later that evening.  It is thought that the diver's BCD 
was inadequate to support the w eight of the twin-set that he was 
using. 
June 2009 09/181 
A pair of divers entered the w ater and started to descend a 
shotline to a wreck in a maximum depth of 34m.  One of the pair 
had a leaky  neck seal on his dry suit and he agreed w ith his 
buddy that he w ould abort the dive if it gave problems and that 
the buddy would continue w ithout him.  The buddy  sw am 
downwards and the diver with the leaky seal followed.  At 2m the 
regulator of the diver with the leaky seal stopped providing air so 
he swapped to his alternative air source.  How ever, he did not 
have enough breath to clear this regulator and as he breathed in 
he inhaled some water which caused him to cough.  He 
remembers dumping his w eightbelt but then he lost 
consciousness.  His buddy  waited at the bottom of the shotline 
then assumed that he had had a problem w ith his neck seal and 
aborted the dive so the buddy  continued his dive.  The boat was 
picking up the first pair to surface when they noticed the troubled 
diver's fins at the surface.  They  moved tow ards him and found 
him on his back with only the lower part of his legs and fins out of 
the water, his regulator w as out of his mouth, his face w as blue 
and his ey es w ere bulging and bl oodshot.  They  removed his 
diving equipment and recovered him into the boat.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and some of the other divers from the 
party were recovered.  The diver w as placed on oxygen, he was 
unconscious and his breathing w as noisy.  Three lifeboats and a 
helicopter were tasked to assist and the diver w as airlifted to 
hospital.  Attempts had been made to fill the casualty 's BCD with 
air when it w as dumped so that it could be recovered later, 
however, despite extensive surface searches it was not found.  It 
is believed that the casualty 's air had been turned on prior to the 
dive and it w as suggested that contact w ith the shotline may  
have switched it off.  The casualty  made a good recovery  and 
was released from hospital two days later. 
June 2009 09/170 
A pair of divers conducted a dri ft dive in a maximum depth of 
24m.  As planned, a delay ed SMB was deployed when one of 
the divers reached 100 bar.  They started their ascent but at 15m 
one of the pair experienced breathing difficulties and reported 
that her legs had 'turned to lead'.  They  continued to 10m where 
the buddy took the SMB reel from the troubled diver as she w as 
in obvious distress.  At 6m the buddy  signalled a 3 min stop but 
the troubled diver signalled 'No' and they  both made a rapid 
ascent to the surface.  The buddy  signalled for help and both 
were quickly recovered from the w ater.  The distressed diver, 
who w as now  vomiting, w as placed on oxy gen and the 
Coastguard was alerted.  The casualty was airlifted to hospital 
where it w as found that she had ingested water.  It is thought 
that a borrowed mask contributed to the problems. 
June 2009 09/344 
Solent Coastguard received a call from a local w ork boat 
advising that they  had been approached by  a dive boat w ith a 
request to call an ambulance for a diver w ho was unwell.  It had 
been necessary for the dive boat to travel some 15 miles to get 
back to port, and they  had not at any  time informed the 
Coastguard, or requested assistance from them.  Advice from 
the duty  diving  doctor via Solent Coastguard w as to breathe 
oxygen for 6 hours and monitor the condition of the diver.  
(Coastguard report). 
June 2009 09/461 
The casualty made a giant stride entry into a pool.  On surfacing 
the instructor noticed she was bleeding from the back of her 
head as she had hit her head on her regulator first stage.  The 
casualty w as assisted out of the pool and first aid w as 
administered.  She was then taken to hospital for a check-up.

A diver experienced pain in his ear follow ing a dive and during 
the following night.  He sought medical advice and his ear drum 
was found to be inflamed and 'indraw n', he also had a blocked 
Eustachian tube.  He w as given pain killers and decongestants.  
It is reported that he normally  descended head first and at a fast 
rate. 
July 2009 09/462 
The casualty  w as making a descent and he had problems 
equalising the pressure in his ears.  When he reached the 
bottom, at a depth of 23m, he felt dizzy so he made a controlled 
ascent and safety  stop.  He w as checked at hospital and no 
eardrum rupture was found but he had w ater in his ear and he 
was advised not to dive for the weekend.

Three divers conducted a w reck dive to a maximum depth of 
31m.  During their ascent back up the w reck one of the divers 
appeared unhappy and clung to the w reck.  They  signalled the 
ascent and one of the divers led the troubled diver back to the 
shotline and helped her to ascend.  They completed a 2 min stop 
at 6m and a 1 min stop at 3m.  Once at the surface the troubled 
diver was out of breath and very  distressed.  She vomited and

was very  pale.  She w as assisted from the w ater and her 
condition was monitored during the return journey .  On the way 
she was sick again.  Once ashore she w as able to walk, but was 
very tired and her breathing w as noisy .  An hour later her 
condition had not improved and she attended the local hospital.  
Inhalation of water and/or vomit w as diagnosed and she w as 
taken by lifeboat to a hospital w here she w as observed 
overnight.  She was discharged the following day with antibiotics.  
She later reported that she had dislodged her regulator when 
looking up during the ascent. 
July 2009 09/221 
Brixham Coastguard received a call from a boat reporting tw o 
divers in difficulty .  Along with the boat reporting proceeding to 
assist, a local police boat w as assigned by  the police control, a 
local fishing boat offered assistance, and Ply mouth ILB w as 
tasked to investigate.  It w as found there w ere two divers diving 
from the shore w ho had been sw ept away by the current.  The 
divers w ere returned to shore but only one of them needed 
treatment.  They  were taken by  ambulance to DDRC Plymouth 
for assessment.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2009 09/248 
An instructor and a trainee entered the w ater from the shore to 
conduct training drills.  They sw am out to a depth of 6m and 
completed a mask clearing exercise.  They  then moved to 
alternative air source training; the instructor gave air to the 
trainee and they  ascended to the surface.  At the surface the 
trainee started coughing and her sputum w as seen to be blood 
stained.  The instructor dropped the trainee's w eightbelt and 
towed her to the shore.  She w as placed on oxy gen and the 
emergency services w ere alerted.   She w as taken to hospital 
where a pulmonary  oedema w as diagnosed.  It w as 
subsequently found that the trainee w as taking medication for 
high blood pressure, w hich she had not declared prior to this 
event. 
August 2009 09/227 
Shetland Coastguard received a call from a dive boat reporting 
that they had a diver onboard w ho had taken in w ater and 
required immediate lifesaving assistance.  The boat was only just 
outside the harbour so Lerw ick AWLB was tasked to recover the 
diver from the boat and transfer ashore.  The lifeboat was met by 
Lerwick Coastguard rescue team and an ambulance which 
transferred the diver to hospital for treatment.  (Coastguard & 
RNLI reports). 
August 2009 09/284 
Prior to a dive a diver felt a littl e seasick after a heavy lunch.  He 
conducted a 36 min dive to a maximum depth of 19m w ith a 1 
min stop at 9m and a 3 min stop at 6m.  On surfacing he 
reported that he had to exhale violently  at 4m and that he felt 
that he couldn't take a full breath.  Once back on shore diving 
medical advice was sought and the diver attended a hospital for 
examination.  He was given a chest x-ray which showed no lung 
problems but it did indicate a large amount of air in his stomach.  
It w as concluded that this ai r prevented his diaphragm from 
functioning correctly and was due to him sw allowing air during 
the dive. 
August 2009 09/251 
A diver was walking along an aluminium gangplank betw een a 
dive boat and the shore, in full kit, at the end of a day 's diving.  
His left foot slipped and he fell onto his right knee w ith his leg 
folded under him. Initially  he thought that he had dislocated his 
knee but, w ith assistance from others, he was able to straighten 
his leg, relieving much of the pain.  Once he had removed his 
drysuit it could be seen that his kneecap was displaced.  He was 
taken by ambulance to hospital w here it w as found that he 
needed surgery to treat a snapped patella tendon. 
August 2009 09/366 
Solent Coastguard received a 'Pan Pan' urgency call from a dive 
boat who had a diver onboard who had made a rapid ascent and 
was suffering from a bleeding nose.   Medical advice from Poole 
hyperbaric chamber w as that given the dive profile and 
circumstances, the diver did not need to be taken to the 
chamber, but should go to hospital for assessment.  New haven 
AWLB w as tasked to transfer the diver from the boat back to 
shore where he was met by an ambulance for assessment.  It 
was ascertained that the injury was not related to the dive so he 
was treated at the dock and did not need to go to hospital.  
(Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
August 2009 09/367 
Shetland Coastguard received a call from a dive boat reporting 
that they  had a y oung diver onboard w ho w as complaining of 
pains in his shoulders follow ing a normal ascent from a deep 
dive, it transpired he had also received a bang to the head prior 
to descending.  The boat was met by  Stromness CRT and an 
ambulance where the diver was assessed and did not need to go 
to hospital.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2009 09/369 
Falmouth Coastguard received a call from a dive boat on the 
Isles of Scilly reporting they had a diver who was feeling sick and 
had red lips.  It w as thought his symptoms could have been due 
to carbon monoxide poisoning from bad air rather than DCI.  The 
diver was assessed by a paramedic who advised transfer to the 
hyperbaric chamber.  The diver w as airlifted to the HLS at 
Plymouth Hoe by  rescue helicopter R-193 where he was met by 
Plymouth CRT and an ambulance for transport to the hyperbaric 
chamber at DDRC.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2009 09/307 
Two divers entered the water from a boat and dived to a depth of 
6m.  5 min into the dive, one of the pair, a trainee, failed to return 
an 'OK' signal.  She pointed to her regulator second stage and 
signalled 'Up'.  They started to ascend and at 3m the dive leader 
noticed that the trainee w as breathing heavily ; he brought her to 
the surface using a controlled buoy ant lift.  At the surface he 
inflated her BCD and removed her mouthpiece and then called 
the boat for assistance.  The trainee then passed out, her 
weightbelt and diving set w ere removed and she was lifted into 
the boat.  Once in the boat her hood and neck seal were 
removed and she regained consciousness.  She w as taken to 
the shore and the emergency  servic es were alerted.  She w as 
placed on oxy gen and diving medical advice w as sought.  She 
made a full recovery. 
August 2009 09/372 
Humber Coastguard received a 999 call from a dive boat 
reporting that they  had a diver onboard who had made a rapid 
ascent from 8m and w as feeling unw ell, although not show ing 
any signs or symptoms of DCI and he w as placed on oxygen by 
the boat.  Medical advice from the Institute of Naval Medicine 
(INM) was that he should remain on oxygen for at least 6 hours 
and be taken immediately  to hos pital for monitoring of his 
condition.    Rescue helicopter R-131 airlifted to diver to 
Wansbeck hospital A&E and New biggin CRT assisted at the 
HLS,  (Coastguard report). 
August 2009 09/264 
An instructor and tw o trainees dived to 17m to conduct some 
basic training drills.  They  made a slow  descent as one of the 

 
 
NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2009    
?BSAC - 2009   23 
trainees had problems clearing his ears.  While practising mask 
clearing, in a depth of 14m, this trainee started to cough and 
made a rapid ascent to the surface before the instructor could 
stop him.  The instructor and the other trainee made a normal 
ascent but missed out the planned safety  stop.  Their dive 
duration was 10 min.  At the surface the trainee seemed happy 
to continue the dive so they  returned to 6m and dived for a 
further 15 min.  After a surface interval of 1 hour 20 min they  
dived again, this time to a maximum depth of 15m for a duration 
of 25 min.  The follow ing day the diver w ho had made the rapid 
ascent felt unwell, weak and he had a tingling sensation in both 
arms; he sought diving medical advice.  He attended a 
recompression chamber and received a session of 
recompression treatment; this treatment did not resolve his 
symptoms and a viral infection was finally diagnosed. 
September 2009 09/376 
Falmouth Coastguard received a call from the ambulance 
service reporting they had received a call reporting a diver on the 
beach who had ingested w ater.  Porthoustock CRT attended to 
provide assistance.  It transpir ed that the individual was doing a 
try dive and had panicked at about 2m and come to the surface.  
(Coastguard report). 
September 2009 09/289 
An instructor and two trainees descended to a target depth of 
20m.  At 16m one of the trainees began to panic and he put air 
into his BCD and made a rapid ascent to the surface.  The 
instructor and the other trainee follow ed.  At the surface the 
panicked trainee calmed down and they re-descended to 13m to 
continue the dive.  They  surfaced after 17 min with a 3 min 
safety stop at 6m.  The follow ing day the trainee awoke feeling 
extremely tired and he sought medical advice; he had nasal 
congestion and a slight pain in his left ear.  Tw o days later he 
noticed a few painful bubble-like sw ellings in his abdomen and 
right armpit.  Again diving medical advice was sought and a skin 
irritation was diagnosed. 
September 2009 09/395 
Portland Coastguard received a 'Pan Pan' urgency  call from a 
dive RHIB reporting they  had a diver who was feeling unwell 
following his dive.  The boat was already ashore, and as soon as 
the call w as made to the Coastguard a doctor arrived to 
assessed the diver.  The doctor quickly  assessed the illness was 
not dive related, so no further assistance was required from the 
Coastguard.  (Coastguard report).

Two divers and two non-divers took an RHIB to sea to test it out 
after a recent service.  The divers proposed to conduct a 
possible drift dive.  They  decided not to dive because the area 
of their proposed dive w as temporarily  out of bounds.  They 
decided to fish instead.  When they  tried to recover the anchor 
they found that it was stuck and one of the divers dived down to 
free it; the depth w as about 10m.  This diver then surfaced and 
was carried aw ay from the boat by  a current; the anchor was 
still in place.  The diver w as in some distress so the other diver 
kitted up and entered the w ater to help her.  As he did so he 
told the others in the boat to cut the anchor line and to come 
and pick them up.  Eventually the two in the boat succeeded in 
cutting the line but the engine stalled and they  were unable to 
re-start it.  At this point the tw o in the boat contacted the 
Coastguard and a helicopter and tw o lifeboats w ere tasked to 
assist.  A nearby  range tender also came to assist and 
recovered the divers from the w ater.  They  w ere returned to 
their boat, the engine w as restarted and they  returned to the

October 2008 09/012 
Three divers dived to a maximum depth of 20m.  One of the 
divers experienced problems with his air supply and noticed that 
his pressure gauge w as fluctuating as he breathed.  He 
indicated to one of his buddies to check that his air w as turned 
on correctly but the buddy turned the air supply off by mistake; it 
had only been on less than one turn.  The diver w ho was now 
without air made a rapid ascent to the surface.  At the surface 
he struggled to stay  afloat even w ith his buddies' help.  A boat 
went to their assistance and they  w ere recovered from the 
water.  The troubled diver was placed on oxygen for a while and 
quickly recovered. 
October 2008 09/067 
A diver conducted tw o dives to depths greater than 30m.  On 
the second dive he made a rapid ascent from 20m.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and the diver was taken by lifeboat to a 
recompression facility.  The diver showed no symptoms of DCI 
and he was transferred to hospital for oxy gen treatment and 
overnight observation.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
October 2008 09/015 
Two divers conducted a dive to a planned maximum depth of 
20m.  However, without them realising it, they  descended to a 
depth of 28m.  They tried to move into shallower water and then 
became low on air.  They  ascended directly  to the surface 
missing a planned 3 min safety  stop at 6m.  They  suffered no 
subsequent ill effects. 
October 2008 09/070 
The Coastguard w as alerted after a diver made a rapid ascent 
from a dive to 36m.  The diver w as transferred to a 
recompression facility but he had no sy mptoms of DCI and he 
was not recompressed.  (Coastguard report). 
November 2008 09/019 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 21m.  At 
18m one of the pair started to panic, he ditched his w eightbelt 
and made a faster than normal ascent to the surface.  No 
subsequent ill effects were reported. 
November 2008 09/025 
Three divers descended to a maximum depth of 25m on a night 
dive.  After about 20 min they  started to sw im back to the start 
point in single file.  During this sw im the third diver became 
distressed and the second diver turned to help him.  While this 
was happening the pair unknow ingly floated tow ards the 
surface.  At about 6m the second diver realised w hat w as 
happening and, letting go of the troubled diver, he dumped air 
from his BCD.  The second diver sank back to the bottom at 
25m and the troubled diver w as carried buoyantly to the 
surface.  The second diver looked around for his other buddy 
but he could not see him.  He w as just preparing to move off 
when the troubled diver sank back beside him still in apparent 
distress.  The second diver calmed the troubled diver and they  
started a return sw im.  They  followed the bottom upwards to a 
depth of 18m and then made their ascent.  The second diver 
made a 3 min safety  stop at 6m, but w hile he was checking his 
computer the troubled diver left him and w ent straight to the 
surface.  All three divers left the water safely.  No subsequent ill 
effects were reported.

The casualty made an inverted rapid ascent to the surface from 
a depth of 22m.  He was monitored for DCI symptoms. 
January 2009 09/030 
Two divers conducted a training dive in a lake.  A very  strong 
wind was blow ing and this caused w ater currents in the lake.  
They descended a shotline and began their dive.  About 7 min 
into the dive the instructor felt that the conditions w ere too 
difficult for the trainee and he signa lled to him that they  should 
return.  During the return sw im the instructor lost sight of the 
trainee in a depth of about 10m; he looked around for him and 
then surfaced.  The trainee also surfaced and gave a distress 
signal.  Other divers sw am from the shore to assist them.  All 
divers safely left the water.  The trainee w as placed on oxy gen 
and no subsequent ill effects w ere ex perienced.  The trainee 
later reported that he had been following the instructor against a 
strong current.  He had started to become buoy ant and w as 
unable to dump air quickly enough to prevent his ascent. 
January 2009 09/035 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 16m.  28 
min into the dive one of the pair developed cramp in one of his 
legs; he stopped to try  to ease the problem and he became 
separated from his buddy .  After about 1 min he made a rapid 
ascent to the surface.  At the surface he w as unable find his 
BCD inflator and he struggled to stay  afloat.  He started to 
become exhausted and released his w eightbelt.  Others 
assisted him from the w ater.  Once ashore he was exhausted 
and felt very unw ell.  A doctor examined the diver and the 
Coastguard was alerted.  The diver w as placed on oxy gen and 
then airlifted to a recompression facility.  No sy mptoms of DCI 
were detected and he spent 4 hours in hospital on oxygen 
before being released.

Two divers conducted a w reck dive to a maximum depth of 
30m.  One of the pair w as using borrowed equipment and she 
did not carry sufficient weight.  She had to pull herself down the 
shotline and had difficulty  stay ing on the wreck.  The 
underwater visibility was poor and there w as a current.  The 
diver w ith borrow ed equipment struggled to control her 
buoyancy and they  decided to abort the dive.  They made their 
way back to the shotline w ith the buoyant diver holding onto the 
wreck all the w ay.  Once at the shotline she made a rapid 
ascent to the surface.  Her buddy  surfaced and found her face 
down at the surface.  He signalled the boat and she w as 
recovered from the water.  Their dive duration was 38 min.  The 
Coastguard w as alerted and the diver w as airlifted to a 
recompression chamber.  She w as not recompressed but was 
held overnight in hospital for observation. 
February 2009 09/047 
Two divers suffered a rapid ascent follow ing a dive to 41m, but 
had no signs or symptoms of DCI.  A doctor onboard the dive 
boat was able to administer oxygen while medical advice w as 
obtained from Aberdeen hyperbaric unit.  As the divers were not 
showing any  signs of DCI they were evacuated from the dive 
boat by North Berwick AWLB & ILB and taken by ambulance to 
hospital at Edinburgh Roy al Infirmary  for assessment.  
(Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
February 2009 09/449 
At a depth of 14m the casualty  had a regulator free flow , so he 
took his buddy's alternative air source.  They both made a rapid 
ascent to the surface.  The casualty  complained of DCI 
symptoms so first aid and oxy gen were administered and the 
symptoms disappeared.  He was monitored for more symptoms 
then went home. 
March 2009 09/091 
A 45 year old male diver w as assessed for symptoms of DCI at 
Millport hy perbaric unit then transferred to hospital for 
observation.  The diver had made a rapid ascent from 27m due 
to an equipment failure w hile ascending from a 44m dive.  
(Coastguard report). 
March 2009 09/086 
A pair of divers conducted a dive  to a maximum depth of 44m.  
After about 12 min they  began an ascent up a sandy slope.  At 
27m their decompression requirements had reduced to 1 min at 
6m.  At this point one of the pair felt that he w as beginning to 
become buoyant.  He attempted to dump air from his BCD and 
checked that his suit's auto dump valve w as fully open.  When 
he pulled on the shoulder dump of his BCD the cord came away 
in his hand.  He began to make a buoy ant ascent.  His buddy 
attempted to grab him but missed.  The buoy ant diver w as 
carried rapidly to the surface.  His total dive duration w as 27 
min.  He w as recovered into the boat and placed on oxy gen.  
His computer show ed a fast ascent.  The buddy made a safe 
ascent.  The Coastguard w as alerted as a precaution and the 
diver w as advised to attend a recompression facility for a 
check-up.  He was found to have a mild skin rash and w as sent 
to hospital where he was placed on ox ygen.  No subsequent ill 
effects were experienced.  The diver had been using a different 
cylinder configuration from normal and it was suggested that his 
weighting may have been incorrect. 
March 2009 09/093 
A diver who surfaced in difficulty  was airlifted to hospital by RN 
rescue helicopter R177 follow ing a rapid ascent from 31m.  
Largs inshore lifeboat w as launched and another vessel 
proceeded to assist in recovering the dive boat's other ten 
divers who were still in the water.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
April 2009 09/099 
MRCC Falmouth received a VHF call from a dive boat 
requesting medical advice for a diver w ho had made a rapid 
ascent from  a 25m dive.  The dive manager w as connected 
with the duty doctor at the DDRC who advised that the casualty  
should be observed for an hour on s hore.  As the dive boat still 
had divers in the w ater Falmouth RNLI inshore lifeboat w as 
launched to assist.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
April 2009 09/174 
A diver and an instructor conducted a dive to a maximum depth 
of 19m.  During the dive the less experienced diver practised 
the use of an SMB.  On tw o occasions the less experienced 
diver lost control of her buoy ancy and started to rise before 
dumping air and re-descending. 13 mi n into the dive she put air 
into her suit again and w as unable to stop a buoy ant ascent to 
the surface.  The instructor made a fast ascent to 10m and then 
made a normal ascent to the surface w ith a 1 min stop at 6m.  
At the surface the diver w ho had made the buoyant ascent 
failed to respond to signals from the shore as she w as 
concentrating on reeling in the SMB line.  Once the instructor 
surfaced the two re-grouped and made their w ay ashore.  
Neither diver suffered any subsequent ill effect.  It is thought 
that the diver was focused on controlling the SMB line and thus 
distracted from keeping good control of her buoyancy. 
April 2009 09/133 
Two divers conducted a 42 min dive to a depth of 30m including 
a 3 min stop at 3m.  2 hours 7 min later they dived to 30m.  
About 38 min into this dive, at a depth of about 11m, one of the 
pair ran out of air and took the octopus regulator of his buddy.  
The diver w ho w as out of air attempted to deploy a delayed 
SMB and they  sank back to 16m w hile doing so.  They  then 
made a rapid ascent directly to the surface.  One of the divers' 
computers indicated that they  had missed 20 min of 
decompression, the other indicated a missed stop at 6m.  They 
were recovered into the boat and placed on nitrox.  Once 
ashore they  sought diving medical advice and they were 
advised to self monitor for symptoms.  No subsequent ill effects 
were reported. 
May 2009 09/121 
Three divers conducted a 20 min dive to 30m.  Towards the end 
of the dive one of the three deployed a delayed SMB.  He filled 
the buoy using his octopus regulator and, as the buoy started to 
ascend, the line caught around the regulator.  The others  tried 
to assist him and, in the confusion, they all made a rapid ascent 
to the surface.  The Coastguard was alerted and diving medical 
advice w as sought.  None of the divers developed any  
symptoms of DCI and they were advised to monitor themselves 
for a period of 48 hours.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2009 09/454 
At a depth of 17m the casualty 's regulator came out of his 
mouth and he aspirated w ater w hen he replaced and purged

June 2009 09/157 
A diver conducted an uneventful dive to a maximum depth of 
28m.  During his ascent he felt buoy ant at 15m, he tried to 
dump air from his drysuit but was unsuccessful.  He opened the 
suit's neck seal to allow water in to try  to reduce his buoy ancy 
but this was ineffectual.  He held on to his buddy  to try to slow 
his ascent and then adopted a head down position.  His buddy  
was pulled up to 5m at w hich point they  separated; the buddy  
descended to 15m from w here he made a normal ascent 
including stops; the buoyant diver made a rapid ascent to the 
surface missing 3 min of decompression.  His dive duration was 
37 min.  Once out of the w ater he w as found to be sy mptom-
free but he was placed on oxy gen and given w ater to drink.  
The Coastguard was alerted and diving medical advice w as 
sought.  The diver w as airlifted to a recompression facility  but 
no treatment w as found necessary  and he w as discharged 2 
hours later.  The diver w as using a new kit configuration and it 
is thought that he was not correctly weighted.

A trainee and an instructor conducted a dive to a maximum 
depth of 27m.  When the trainee reached 100 bar he deployed 
a delay ed SMB, as planned, usi ng his octopus regulator, to 
start their ascent.  The trainee allowed a lot of air to escape 
around the buoy  and released the buoy  inadequately  inflated.  
Once deployed he started reeling in the line but they  were not 
ascending.  The instructor deployed his own delayed SMB.  The 
trainee indicated that he w as down to 50 bar.  The instructor 
gave the trainee his alternative air source, the trainee released 
his SMB and they  started their ascent.  At 16m their ascent 
became rapid and they rose quickly to the surface.  Once in the

trainee was acting as the recipient of air she inadvertently  put 
the instructor's regulator into her mouth upside-down.  She 
inhaled water and started to panic.  The instructor tried to give 
her her main regulator back but she continued to panic and she 
swam for the surface.  The instructor slowed her ascent and 
succeeded in getting the regulator back into her mouth, but the 
rapid ascent continued to the surface.  At the surface the 
instructor put air into the trainee's BCD and she recovered.  
After checking that the trainee w as fit they continued the dive 
and training plan.

Brixham Coastguard received a call from a dive boat w ith two 
divers onboard who had made a rapid ascent and missed stops 
and one of them was unwell.  A doctor at the DDRC Ply mouth 
provided medical advice and the boat returned to shore for the 
divers to be transferred by ambulance to the hy perbaric 
chamber. (Coastguard report). 
July 2009 09/209 
Clyde Coastguard received a call requesting medical advice for 
two divers who had made a rapid ascent from 6m follow ing a 
40m dive, had missed stops, but were not showing any signs or 
symptoms of DCI.  Largs AWLB w as tasked to meet with the 
dive boat to transfer the divers ashore.  The lifeboat was met by 
Cumbrae Coastguard rescue team who transferred the divers to 
the hy perbaric chamber at Millport for treatment.  The divers 
were later taken to Lady  Margaret hospital for monitoring.  
(Coastguard & RNLI reports).

Shetland Coastguard received a call from a dive boat reporting 
that they  had a diver onboard w ho had made a rapid ascent 
after a dive to 38m.  He w as not show ing any  signs or 
symptoms of DCI, but he developed a headache shortly after 
the call for help was made.  The boat still had other divers in the 
water so was unable to return to shore immediately .  Lerw ick 
AWLB was tasked to  evacuate the diver.  The lifeboat returned 
ashore where they were met by  an ambulance w ho transferred 
the diver to hospital for treatment.  (Coastguard & RNLI 
reports). 
July 2009 09/222 
Humber Coastguard received a call from Seahouses lifeboat 
operations manager (LOM) that he had been made aware of a 
diver ashore w ho had made a rapid ascent from 22m.  The 
LOM had already called an ambulance but w as put in a medi-
link call w ith a dive doctor w ho spoke to the diver and advised 
him not to dive again that day, and to monitor his own condition. 
The diver was told that it w as only  because he exhaled on 
ascent that he avoided suffering a lung expansion injury .  He 
was told that if he felt worse he was to contact the Coastguard 
for further help.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2009 09/246 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 29m.  During 
his ascent he planned to conduc t a 5 min decompression stop 
at 6m.  How ever, he w as too buoy ant and was only able to 
complete a 2 min stop before surfacing.  He w as placed on 
oxygen for 20 min.  No sy mptoms developed and no further 
action was taken. 
August 2009 09/247 
A pair of divers descended to dive a w reck in a maximum depth 
of 35m.  One of the pair had difficulty  clearing his ears during 
the descent.  At the bottom of the shotline the dive leader 
attached a distance line and they moved about 30m away along 
the wreck.  They turned to make their return and w hen they  
were about 10m from the shotline the diver w ho had had ear 
problems indicated that he wanted to ascend.  The dive leader 
moved to unclip the distance line and when he looked back the 
diver had commenced his ascent w ithout him.  The dive leader 
made a normal ascent including a 1 min safety  stop.  The 
troubled diver  passed another pair decompressing on the 
shotline and these other divers indi cated to the dive leader that 
his buddy had already  surfaced.  The troubled diver w as 
recovered into the boat and given fluids and placed on oxy gen.  
The Coastguard was alerted and the diver w as monitored.  No 
symptoms were experienced by  this diver and no further action 
was taken.  It is thought that the diver panicked when he was 
low on air. 
August 2009 09/252 
A diver conducted a w reck dive to a maximum depth of 43m.  
He was using a new BCD which he had previously tried out in a 
pool and freshw ater site.  He had reconfigured his weights, 
moving some of them to the BCD.  During the dive he found 
that the w eights tipped him forw ard and he had to w ork to 
maintain his required posture.  After about 12 min he had 6 min 
of decompression stops indicat ed.  He w as having difficulty 
maintaining depth and he started a gentle buoyant ascent which 
carried him directly  to the su rface missing his decompression 
stops.  Once back in the boat he was placed on oxygen and the 
Coastguard was alerted.  He w as airlifted to a recompression 
chamber for treatment. 
August 2009 09/365 
Brixham Coastguard received a ca ll from a boat reporting that 
they had a diver who had missed stops, but w as not display ing 
any signs or symptoms of DCI.  The boat returned to shore and 
made direct contact with the duty diving doctor at the hyperbaric 
chamber.  The doctor advised on medication to be taken and 
that the diver's condition shoul d be monitored.  (Coastguard 
report). 
August 2009 09/285 
Two divers entered the w ater to conduct a dive to a maximum 
depth of 18m.  One of the divers had been too heavy on a 
previous dive and he removed w eights from his w eightbelt.  
During the descent he had to pull himself dow n the shotline.  
Around 25 min into the dive they had moved to a depth of 15m 
and this diver found it increasingly difficult to stay at depth.  The 
other diver deploy ed a delay ed SMB to make the ascent but 
while he did so the buoyant diver started a buoyant ascent.  He 
was unable to stop himself from being carried to the surface.  
The other diver ascended normally .  Once back in the boat the

that they had two divers who were overdue to surface.  Within a 
couple of minutes of making the call, the boat reported that they  
could now see the divers' SMB on the surface.  The divers were 
recovered safe and well to the boat, having had to make a 
longer decompression stop due to problems with their 
rebreathers.  (Coastguard report). 
diver who had made the buoyant ascent was placed on oxygen.   
When they  reached shore divi ng medical advice w as sought 
and the diver w as taken to hospital w here he w as placed on 
oxygen for 4 hours before being released. 
August 2009 09/260 
A pair of divers conducted a w reck dive to a maximum depth of 
28m.  They deploy ed a delay ed SMB to make their ascent.  
They made their first stop at 15m for 1 min.  While at this stop 
one of the pair took water in through his nose; the water had got 
into his mask.  He tried to clear it but started to panic.  He 
signalled to his buddy that he was going to ascend.  He stopped 
at 7m for about 1 min and then surfaced.  Once back in the boat 
he reported that he had missed stops.  The Coastguard was 
alerted and the diver w as airlifted to a recompression facility  
where he received treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2009 09/380 
Clyde Coastguard received a request from a dive boat for 
medical advice for a diver w ho had missed stops, but w as not 
displaying any signs or symptoms of DCI.  Medical advice from 
the hyperbaric chamber at Dunstaffnage w as that the diver 
should be taken there for assessment and monitoring.  He w as 
transferred to Oban AWLB for transport to the chamber, but 
further medical advice from a doctor at Lorne & Isles hospital 
was that he should be taken to hospital instead as he w as not 
showing any signs or symptoms of DCI.  Therefore, the diver 
was transferred into the care of Oban CRT and taken to the 
hospital by ambulance.  (Coastguard report). August 2009 09/298 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 18m.  
They became disorientated in low visibility.  One of the pair had 
a problem with his ears and the other diver came to assist.  This 
diver then lost control of her buoyancy and made a rapid ascent 
to the surface missing stops. 
September 2009 09/396 
Shetland Coastguard received a call from a dive boat reporting 
they were returning to shore w ith two divers w ho had missed 
stops.  They  were met by  Stromness CRT and an ambulance

October 2008  09/079 
An instructor and three students w ere carrying out training drills 
in a maximum depth of 10m.  One of the students was towing an 
SMB and she noticed another group of divers using a shotline.  
She swam away to avoid entangling them and in doing so 
became separated from the rest of her party .  After a short time 
looking for the others she made a normal ascent to the surface 
where she was reunited with her group. 
November 2008 09/021 
Two pairs of divers w ere engaged in a training dive.  They  
practised mask clearing and two of the divers experienced 
difficulty with their hoods being pull ed backwards as they tried to 
pull the strap over their heads; one of the divers' mask strap 
became detached.  Further into the dive they practised deploying 
a delayed SMB.  While doing so one of the divers' alternative air 
source started to free flow .  They  were unable to stop the free 
flow so they  made a controlled ascent to the surface, using one 
of the other divers' alternative air sources.  During this ascent 
they made a 3 min stop at 6m. 
May 2009 09/117 
A diver surfaced in a panic and w as assisted by  her buddy  and 
other divers.  A boat came to her assistance and after some 
difficulty her weightbelt and equipment w ere removed.  She w as 
recovered into the boat followed by  her equipment.  She soon  
recovered and was returned to her own boat with her buddy.  It is 
thought that over-weighting was the cause of the problem. 
May 2009 09/134 
An instructor and tw o trainees w ere practising the use of 
alternative air sources in a depth of 6m.  During this practice one 
of the divers ingested some water.  At the surface he felt unw ell 
and he left the w ater.  Once out of the water he recovered but 
continued to feel sick. 
May 2009 09/137 
A pair of divers conducted a dive  to a maximum depth of 18m.  
They follow ed a line underw ater and one of the divers' pillar 
valves and first stage snagged on the line.  When this happened 
a second time the diver began to feel distressed and indicated  
that she wanted to ascend.  She then started to make a buoy ant 
ascent.  Her buddy stopped her from making a rapid ascent to 
the surface and they  conducted a 3 min stop at 6m.  At the 
surface the buddy inflated the distressed diver's BCD and called 
for assistance.  The distressed diver w as recovered into a boat 
and brought ashore.  She was placed on oxy gen and began to 
recover.  She was using a hired semi-drysuit which was too tight 
and she reported that she had felt exhausted underwater. 
June 2009 09/151 
Three divers entered the water and dived to a depth of 18m.  
After about 4 min one of the divers  signalled to the dive leader 
that he was out of air.  The dive leader gave this diver his main 
regulator and started to breathe from his octopus regulator.  He 
signalled the ascent and they  made a normal ascent to the 
surface.  Their dive duration was 8 min.  Once in the boat it w as 
discovered that the diver who had run out of air had, by mistake, 
entered the water with his pony regulator in his mouth rather than 
his main regulator. 
June 2009 09/281 
Three divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 30m.  
During their ascent, at a depth of 15m, one of the pair noticed 
that his computer was indicating the necessity for a stop at 23m.  
Without communicating this with his buddies he re-descended.  
One of the others w ent after him and brought him back to 6m 
where they remained until all their computers had cleared.  They  
then conducted an extra 1 min at 6m and 1 min at 3m.  No 
subsequent ill effects w ere reported.  It is thought that the diver 
had set his computer incorrectly. 
August 2009 09/254 
Two divers were ascending from a w reck dive to a maximum 
depth of 35m.  They  had deploy ed a delay ed SMB.  During the 
ascent one of the pair w as buoy ant and rose straight to the 
surface missing a planned stop.  In the confusion his buddy, who 
was carry ing the SMB reel, became tangled in the line.  She 
tried, unassisted, to untangle herself at the 6m stop.  Her 
breathing rate rose and she qui ckly consumed her air.  When 
she surfaced she had insufficient air to inflate her BCD and her 
fins and legs were tangled in t he SMB line.  The positioning of 
her pony regulator made it hard for her to reach it.  She called for 
help and was quickly recovered into the boat.

October 2008  09/016 
Two divers descended to dive on a w reck.  At 8m one of the 
pair developed a regulator free flow .  The diver's buddy  
attempted to stop the free flow  but w as not successful.  The 
diver with the free flow  continued to sink and the buddy  pushed 
him towards the top of the w reck to halt the descent.  They  
stopped at a depth of 11m.  The buddy  passed the other diver 
his alternative air source and t he air to the free flowing valve 
was shut off.  When turned back on the free flow continued so it 
was turned off again.  They  ascended using the buddy's gas 
supply.  Close to the surfac e the buddy  turned the subject 
regulator back on again  to enable the diver to inflate his BCD; 
this time it did not free flow .  Both divers w ere safely recovered 
into the boat.  Their dive time was 5 min. 
January 2009 09/029 
Two divers were engaged in a nitrox training course.  They  
conducted a 38 min dive to a maximum depth of 20m.  2 hours 
later they dived again to a maximum depth of 20m.  After 9 min 
the primary regulator of one of the pair started to free flow .  The 
free flow  could not be stopped and the diver switched to her 
octopus regulator and then to her pony regulator.  Her buddy 
turned her main cy linder off then on again, but the free flow  
continued so the cy linder w as sw itched off.  At this point its 
contents gauge read 30 bar.  They  moved to a nearby shotline 
and made a controlled ascent to the surface.  At the surface the 
main cylinder was switched back on again to allow  the diver to 
inflate her BCD.  The water temperature was 6 deg C. 
March 2009 09/149 
A pair of divers commenced a dive to 32m.  After about 10 min 
one of the pair noticed that his breathing was starting to get 
difficult so he sw itched to his octopus regulator, this did not 
resolve the problem.  He then sw itched to his pony  cylinder but 
this contained nitrox 40 so he indicated to his buddy  that he 
wished to use his alternative air source.  They  then started a 
controlled ascent.  At 15m the diver w ho had had the problems 
switched to his pony  regulator and they  continued to the 
surface.  Subsequent examination did not reveal the cause of 
the problems. 
April 2009 09/321 
An instructor and a trainee entered the w ater to practise 
ascents.  They  made themselves neutrally  buoy ant and then 
rose about 3m from the bottom.  The trainee then began to 
struggle as it appeared that she had dumped too much air and 
was heavy; she began finning quite hard.  Her mask had 
partially steamed up.  The instructor signalled her to stop but 
she began to  panic.  The instructor took hold of her and 
signalled for her to stop but she continued to panic.  The 
instructor was concerned that s he would slide over a ledge into 
deeper water and he pushed her aw ay from the edge.  She 
landed on her back and continued to panic.  The instructor 
brought her to the surface using a controlled buoyant lift.  At the 
surface he inflated her BCD  and she quickly  recovered.  They  
left the water safely.  The trainee had a new  mask and had not 
cleaned manufacturing deposits off the glass. 
June 2009 09/150 
Three rebreather divers conducted a 58 min dive to a maximum 
depth of 25m.  During the dive one of the three lost w eight from 
a pouch on his w eighting sy stem.  He managed to maintain 
contact with the wreck throughout the dive and they made their 
way back to the shotline to make their ascent.  In this w ay the 
diver was able to prevent a buoy ant ascent.  He reported that 
prior to losing the weight he was a little over-w eighted and this 
helped him when the weights were lost. 
July 2009 09/230 
An instructor and two trainees conducted a training dive in a 
maximum depth of 15m to practise  the use of an alternative air 
source.  Later that day  they  di ved again to practise controlled 
buoyant lifts.  The instructor inflated a delay ed SMB to act as a 
datum but her octopus regulator free flowed and would not stop.  
She took the alternative air s ource of one of the trainees and 
they made a safe ascent to the surface. 
July 2009 09/232 
A rebreather diver conducted a solo w reck dive to a maximum 
depth of 52m using a trimix diluent.  After 30 min the alarm 
sounded on his rebreather and the master handset failed; the 
slave also failed.  He bailed out onto a nitrox 32 cy linder and 
sent an emergency yellow signal buoy up his delayed SMB line.  
He made his w ay up to 6m for his final stop and when his 
cylinder was nearly depleted an emergency  cy linder w as 
lowered down to him and a diver follow ed.  He managed to get 
his rebreather working again and he finished his decompression 
on 100% oxygen.  The stand-by diver stayed with him. 
August 2009 09/242 
An operator filling a diving cy linder left an ox ygen supply in an 
active state thus creating the potential for a subsequent user to  
inadvertently fill a cy linder w ith a rich nitrox mixture instead of 
the intended air.  However the situation was found and rectified  
before a problem could arise. 
September 2009 09/292 
An instructor and tw o trainees descended a shotline to a depth 
of 15m.  They were exploring a wreck when one of the trainees 
indicated to the instructor that  his 16kg w eightbelt was slipping 
down.  The instructor led them back to the shotline and told the 
trainee to hang onto it.  He then tried to reposition the 
weightbelt but did not succeed.  He then fastened the weightbelt 
to the shotline and they  made a normal rate ascent up the 
shotline w ith the buoy ant trainee using the shotline to control 
his ascent.

An instructor and a trainee dived to a w reck in a depth of 17m.  
Other divers swam past them and kicked up slit w hich 
dramatically reduced the visibility .  To find better visibility they 
followed a line to another close by wreck.  This wreck was known 
to have fishing line tangled inside it and the divers had been 
warned not to go inside.  As they swam over this wreck visibility 
was again reduced by  silt.  The trainee suddenly  stopped and 
signalled that he could not move.  The instructor checked and 
found that the trainee's legs had dropped into a hole in the wreck 
and one of his fins had become trapped.  The instructor checked 
the trainee's air and then tried to free him but he could not.  He 
waited for the silt to clear but it didn't.  Eventually  the trainee was 
able unclip his fin and pull his leg free.  They  moved to a harbour 
wall and used this to make their ascent to the surface.  The 
trainee struggled to stay  down with buoyancy problems and only  
one fin.  They surfaced safely. 
July 2009 09/352 
Portland Coastguard received a call from a local w ork boat 
reporting that they had found a diver's SMB w ith the line fray ed.  
The boat made a search of the area and found no diver/s in 
distress.  With no diver having been reported as overdue or 
missing, it was considered that it was a just a stray  SMB, a false 
alert with good intent.  (Coastguard report).

arrived it was reported that the divers w ere from a boat who was 
recovering some of their other divers, and they  w ere just 
whistling to get the boat's attenti on to their position.  They were 
recovered by  another boat and taken back to their own boat.  
(Coastguard report). 
September 2009 09/294 
An RHIB was returning to harbour from a dive when they spotted 
a diver in the water, close to the harbour, in apparent difficulty .  
Because of nearby rocks the boat could not get close to the diver 
so a diver from the boat sw am to the troubled diver and towed 
him to the boat.  The diver w as recovered into the boat and 
placed on oxy gen.  The Coastguard w as contacted but was 
already aware of the problem having been alerted by others.  A 
lifeboat arrived to assist.  The diver recovered and refused 
further treatment.  He had been diving alone using a diver 
propulsion vehicle for the first ti me.  He had become inverted in 
his drysuit and exhausted himself.   He had ditched all his diving 
equipment.  The rescuing divers subsequently  recovered his lost 
equipment for him. 
September 2009 09/398 
Brixham Coastguard received a call from someone ashore 
reporting they  had been w atching an SMB for some time, it 
hadn't moved so they  were concerned that there may  be a diver 
in trouble.  Torbay  CRT w ere sent to meet w ith the caller, and 
they were able to confirm that the SMB belonged to a snorkeller 
who had tied it to a crab pot and gone off snorkelling.

Overseas Incidents 
 
 
Decompression Illness 
October 2008  09/017 
During a 46 min dive to 24m a diver experienced ear problems.  
He w as subsequently  given ear drops and antibiotics and he 
missed the next four days diving.  On the fifth day  he dived to 
36m for 40 min in the morning and to 35m for 38 min in the 
afternoon.  At the end of this dive he made a faster than normal 
ascent from 11m to 6m.  Some time after surfacing he 
experienced chest pains; he breathed oxygen for 10 min and 
took indigestion tablets.  Three days later he took a flight home 
during which he developed chest pai ns again.  Diving medical 
advice was sought.  He went to hospital and a minor air 
embolism was diagnosed.  The following day the symptoms had 
cleared. 
November 2008 09/026 
A diver conducted a series of dives over a number of days.  On 
the penultimate day  he dived to 16m for 42 min then later to 
12m for 40 min.  On the last day  he dived to 16m for 33 min 
after a surface interval of 23 hours.  During the ascent from this 
last dive he conducted a 3 min safety  stop at 5m.  Once back 
on land the diver felt dizzy  and had 'pins and needles' in his 
hands.  He w as placed on oxy gen and taken to hospital from 
where he w as moved to a r ecompression facility  for treatment 
for DCI.  The diver had felt cold before entering the water for the 
last dive and there was a slight current; it is thought that these 
factors may have contributed. 
January 2009 09/032 
A diver conducted a 31 min dive to a depth of 17m.  The 
following day , 21 hours later, he dived to 20m for 43 min.  2 
hours 41 min later he dived to 20m.  At the end of this dive the 
diver and his buddy swam, mid-water, at a depth of 10m, back 
towards the shore.  During this sw im the diver became too 
buoyant; he dumped air from his BCD and this made him 
heavy.  The diver sank down to 15m.  He put air into his BCD to 
stop the descent but over compensated and made a buoy ant 
ascent to the surface; his dive duration w as 33 min.  The other 
diver made a normal ascent to the surface; his dive duration 
was 36 min.  They regrouped at the surface and swam safely to 
the shore.  The following day, the diver who had made the rapid 
ascent developed 'pins and needles' in his right arm and a dull 
pain in his right shoulder.  T he diver appeared to have no other 
symptoms and he w as placed on oxy gen and after 20 min the 
'pins and needles' reduced.  After a further 30 min the 'pins and 
needles' had gone but the pain in his shoulder remained.  
Medical advice was sought and the diver w as given 
recompression treatment which resolved his symptoms. 
March 2009 09/127 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 29m.  Her 
computer malfunctioned w hile she w as underw ater so she 
stayed close to the dive leader.  During the final ascent they 
made a stop at 3m.  During this stop the diver felt that she could 
not get enough air into her lungs, she began to hyperventilate 
and was unable to control her breathing.  After 2 min she 
surfaced, got into the boat and asked for oxy gen.    Her 
breathing was shallow and 'gurgling' and the oxy gen did not 
help much.  She coughed up pink froth.  She w as taken to 
hospital where a pulmonary oedema and heart attack w ere 
diagnosed.  Subsequent investigat ions revealed that she had a 
PFO and it w as thought that a bubble had shunted into her 
coronary artery causing a blockage. 
June 2009 09/154 
A diver completed his third dive of the day , a 37 min dive to 
22m with a 3 min stop at 5m.  He had been diving for a total of 
three days.  About 10 min after surfacing he noticed a pain in 
his left shoulder.  He was not concerned as this w as the site of 
a previous shoulder injury  that often gave him pain.  5 min later 
he was placed on oxygen and he was given fluids.  10 min later 
the pain developed to include his elbow .  He w as taken to 
hospital and later that evening he was taken to a recompression 
facility for treatment.  The treatment resolved his symptoms and 
he was released the following day. 
July 2009 09/175 
A diver conducted a 53 min dive to a depth of 18m.  1 hour 33 
min later the diver dived again to  19m for a duration of 56 min.   
The follow ing day  the diver developed a headache and chest 
pain.  Diving medical advice w as sought and the diver w as 
placed on oxy gen.  The dive r developed 'pins and needles' in 
the arms and legs but these sy mptoms w ere relieved by 
oxygen.  The diver was transferred to a recompression chamber 
but the oxy gen ran out before they  got there and the diver 
experienced a return of the sy mptoms together w ith an itching 
sensation over the w hole body .  All sy mptoms w ere fully  
resolved by recompression treatment. 
September 2009 09/311 
Two divers conducted a 29 min dive to a maximum depth of 
20m with a 5 min safety  stop at 5m.  4 hours 6 min later they 
dived again to 20m for 39 min w ith a 5 min safety  stop at 5m.  
The follow ing day  one of the pair complained of 'pins and 
needles' in her foot.  Diving m edical advice was sought and the 
diver was taken to a r ecompression facility where she received 
two sessions of recompression therapy. 
 
 
 
Illness / Injury 
March 2009 09/128 
A pair of divers w ere conducting a dive on a reef.  During the 
dive, one of the pair noticed a diver in another pair in apparent 
difficulties.  This diver was signalling 'out of air' to his buddy  but 
he would not take his buddy 's alternative air source.  The diver  
who had seen this going on noticed that the troubled diver and 
his buddy  were sinking dow n the reef; he w ent to assist.  He 
found that the troubled diver still had 70 bar in his cy linder but 
he seemed fixated on his computer and w ould not respond to 
signals.  He then appeared to lose consciousness.  The 
rescuing diver tried to inflate the troubled diver's BCD but could 
not find the inflator and he noticed that the troubled diver w as 
pulling on his BCD dump and he pushed the rescuing diver 
away.  The rescuing diver then took hold of the troubled diver's 
BCD and used his ow n buoyancy to bring them to the surface.  
Their deepest depth w as 46m.  Once on the surface the 
troubled diver managed to inflate his ow n jacket and they  were 
recovered from the water.  Afterw ards he reported that he 
remembered feeling semiconscious during the dive, know ing 
that he was in trouble but unable to w ork out w hat to do to 
resolve the problem.  No subsequent ill effects were 
experienced.

NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2009    
March 2009 09/084 
A trainee diver conducted a dive and,  after a surface interval of 
2 hours, he entered the water for a second dive.  He descended 
to 6m but was unable to clear his left ear at this depth.  He 
ascended to 3m and tried again but could not clear the ear.  He 
left the water.  Later he sought medical attention and a bruised 
left eardrum was diagnosed.  He was advised not to fly  or dive 
for a period of five days. 
June 2009 09/177 
A trainee diver and an instructor conducted a dive to a depth of 
20m.  The trainee had broken her own mask and dived with one 
loaned by  another diver.  This mask w as of a much larger 
volume and during the ascent the trainee w as unable to clear 
the mask properly .  She suffered mask squeeze and the 
instructor, unable to assist her, aborted the dive.  Their dive 
duration was 7 min.  Once out of the w ater the trainee w as 
found to have sinus pain and a bloodshot left ey e.  Both her 
eyes quickly puffed up and she was taken to hospital.  She was 
prescribed pain killers. 
August 2009 09/283 
A diver was recovered from the w ater with a head injury  which 
was bleeding.  He reported that he had not seen a trigger fish 
on the seabed which had caused his injury.  First aid was given 
on site. 
August 2009 09/287 
A diver entered the water from a jetty  which was 2m above the 
water surface.  Contrary  to instructions he looked down as he 
completed a stride entry .  His face mask w as shattered by  the 
incident and he received a cut to his eyelid. 
September 2009 09/271 
Two divers entered the water from an RHIB.  A buoyancy check 
was conducted and one of the divers added some w eight to his 
belt.  The divers descended and the diver w ho had had the 
extra weight did not seem comfortable.  He w as sw imming 
awkwardly, breathing heavily and showed signs of anxiety .  His 
mask was flooding and he did not seem to be able to clear it.  
His buddy tried to help but the troubled diver indicated that he 
wanted to ascend.  His buddy  took hold of him and used a 
controlled buoyant lift to bring them to the surface.  During the 
ascent, at a depth of about 10m, the troubled diver stopped 
responding to signals, he coughed some blood and lost the 
regulator from his mouth.  His buddy  replaced the regulator and 
brought him to the surface.  They  were recovered into the boat.  
The troubled diver was conscious but not fully  aw are.  The 
emergency services w ere alerted and the boat returned to 
shore. Both divers w ere taken to hospital, the buddy was 
declared fit immediately, the troubled diver was discharged after 
2 hours on oxygen. 
September 2009 09/290 
A diver completed a 37 min dive to 30m w ith a 3 min stop at 
6m.  2 hours 28 min later he dived to 25m for 38 min w ith a 3 
min stop at 6m.  Later that day  he w as walking when he felt 
very dizzy  and developed double vision.  He lay  down and 
diving medical advice was sought.  He w as taken to hospital 
and placed on oxy gen for 6 hours.  Various tests were 
conducted but nothing untoward w as found.  His sy mptoms 
resolved and he w as released later the follow ing day .  It is 
thought that dehydration rather than DCI was the cause. 
September 2009 09/291 
A trainee experienced problems clearing his ears during a 
descent.  The group ascended to 2m and the trainee indicated 
that he wished to descend again.  Once again he was unable to 
clear his ears and the dive w as aborted.  The diver sought 
medical attention and was advised to cease diving. 
September 2009 09/293 
A trainee w as taking part in a controlled buoy ant lift practice 
from a depth of 4m w hen he developed a sharp pain in the 
sinus over his left brow .  On surfacing the pain eased.  He 
sought medical attention. 
 
 
 
Boating and Surface 
February 2009 09/039 
A diver was attempting to attach the painter of an RHIB to a 
buoy marking a w reck.  His foot became trapped betw een a 
decompression cylinder and a water container.  He pulled to 
release his leg and as his leg became free a sw ell hit the boat, 
he lost balance and fell overboard.  He w as wearing a dry suit 
and a lifejacket.  The lifejacket automatically  inflated and he 
was recovered into the boat.  No subsequent adverse effects 
were experienced. 
 
 
 
Ascents 
November 2008 09/034 
A group of divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 
35m.  6 min into the dive, at a depth of 34m, one of the group 
was seriously affected by nitrogen narcosis and he became 
unresponsive.  His buddy  started to lift the troubled diver using 
a controlled buoyant lift and a third member of the party came to 
help.  The troubled diver began to panic and bolted for the 
surface.  In doing so he lost his regulator.  He made a rapid 
ascent to the surface taking w ith him the third diver, w ho was 
trying to replace his regulator and to slow  the ascent.  The 
buddy surfaced shortly  afterw ards.  The distressed diver w as 
still panicking and others helped to remove him from the w ater.  
The troubled diver show ed no signs  of DCI but he w as placed 
on oxygen.  The diver w as assessed by  a doctor and no 
adverse effects were identified. 
 
 
 
Technique 
January 2009 09/028 
A new ly qualified diver on holiday  conducted his first dive to 
16m for 20 min.  During this dive  his air consumption w as very 
high.  3 hours later he made a second dive and w as given a 
larger cy linder and briefed on buoyancy control and relaxing.  
He appeared nervous so a slow  pace was adopted.  During the 
dive, at a depth of 18m, he became frustrated that he couldn't 
control his buoyancy as well as he w anted to and he struggled 
to cope with a slight current.  He w orried that his breathing rate 
was too high, he started to hy per-ventilate and he took in some 
water.  His buddy  and the dive leader took him to the surface.  
His weightbelt was ditched and he was assisted from the water.  
He w as sick at the surface and again in the boat.  He was 
placed on oxy gen and monitored for sy mptoms of DCI.  Once 
ashore he was seen by a doctor but no ill effects were found. 
March 2009 09/085 
Two divers entered the water and descended a shotline.  At the

bottom, at a depth of 22m, the first diver looked back to see his 
buddy some w ay up the line.  The buddy  w as delay ed by 
problems w ith clearing his ears.  The first diver signalled the 
second but got no reply  so he re-ascended 7m w here he found 
the other diver off the line trying to clear his ears.  The first diver 
indicated that the troubled dive r should hold on to the line and 
after confirmation he re-descended.  At this point they became 
separated.  The first diver lost sight of the troubled diver so he 
made an ascent to the surface and left the w ater.  The second 
diver descended, on his ow n, off the line, and joined other 
divers from the party.  After a while he indicated to these divers 
that he had lost his buddy, they  indicated that the buddy  had 
ascended and the diver then made his way back to the surface. 
 
 
 
Equipment 
October 2008 09/078 
Two divers conducted a 35 min dive to 13m.  At the surface, at 
the end of the dive, one of the pair experienced difficulty  
maintaining positive buoyancy.  He tried both direct feed and 
oral methods to inflate his BCD but without success.  His buddy 
tried too but failed.  The diver held onto the SMB to provide 
buoyancy and they  were recovered into the boat.  Once out of 
the water it was discovered that the inflator hose on the diver's 
BCD had become detached from the bag of the BCD thus 
allowing the air to escape. 
February 2009 09/040 
Two divers conducted a training dive on a wreck to a maximum 
depth of 25m.  They completed a controlled buoyant lift practice 
to 6m and then re-descended to 20m to try  to reach the w reck 
again.  A current carried them aw ay from the w reck and they  
decided to abort the dive.  One of the divers deployed a delayed 
SMB.  As they started the ascent the other diver noticed that his 
equipment w as pulling to the right and he discovered that a 
weight had fallen from the left side of his integrated weight 
system.  Despite this he w as able to make a normal ascent 
including a 3 min safety stop at 6m. 
February 2009 09/041 
A pair of divers descended to a maximum depth of 25m on a 
wreck.  During the dive, at a depth of 16m, one of the pair 
moved into a horizontal position and both w eights fell from the 
pouches of his integrated weight system.  He was able to make 
his way to a shotline and he used this to make a normal ascent, 
including a 3 min safety stop at 6m.  This diver had been careful 
to check his weights prior to the dive as another diver had lost a 
weight from a similar weight system earlier that day. 
 
 
 
 
March 2009 09/083 
An instructor and a trainee were ascending from a dive to 26m 
and, at a depth of 12m, the trainee attempted to deploy a 
delayed SMB.  His regulator began to free flow  and he started 
to sink back down.  The instructor gave the trainee his ow n 
alternative air source and attempted to stop the trainee's free 
flow by  breathing from this regulator.  This w as unsuccessful 
and the trainee's air supply  began to fail.  The instructor 
returned to his own primary regulator and brought the trainee to 
the surface using a controlled buoy ant lift.  Their dive duration 
was 21 min.  No subsequent ill effects w ere experienced.  The 
regulator was checked but no fault was found. 
May 2009 09/303 
A dive group experienced a series of 'O' ring failures, ty pically 
they occurred about 10 min into the dive and in each case the 
buddy provided his alternative air source to bring the affected 
diver to the surface.  Examination revealed that the 'O' rings 
were smaller than they  should have been and had become 
brittle.  A new supply of 'O' rings was obtained and fitted. 
May 2009 09/132 
Three divers conducted a dive on a w reck to a maximum depth 
of 35m.  During the dive, at a depth of 23m they  prepared to 
enter into the wreck.  Two divers moved in expecting the third to 
follow.  However, as the third diver entered the wreck one of the 
weight pouches on his integrated w eighting system caught on 
the wreck and the w eights dropped away.  He rose up until he 
was stopped by  the roof of the section of w reck that he was 
entering.  His buddies realised that there w as a problem and 
returned to help.  The weights had landed on a ledge just below 
the diver and the others recovered them and assisted the diver  
to refit them.  The dive then proceeded as planned. 
September 2009 09/288 
A diver was preparing for a dive.  During his air checks the high 
pressure hose to his cylinder pressure gauge split close to the 
junction with the regulator first stage.  
 
 
 
Miscellaneous 
August 2009 09/286 
An instructor and two trainees descended a shotline to a w reck 
at a depth of 16m using nitrox 36.  They  proceeded along the 
deck to a large open hold.  They  descended into the hold to a 
depth of 20m.  At this point one of the trainees started to panic 
and to hyperventilate.  The instructor took hold of the trainee 
and brought him to the surface us ing a controlled buoy ant lift.  
The other trainee followed them to the surface.  All three w ere 
safely recovered from the water and the trainee made a sw ift 
recovery.
