Introduction 
 
This booklet contains the 2006 Diving Incidents Report, produced by The British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC) in the 
interest of promoting diving safety.  It is important to note that it contains details of UK sports diving incidents 
occurring to divers of all affiliations, plus incidents occurring worldwide involving BSAC members.  
 
Report Format 
The majority of statistical information contained within this report is also shown in graphical form.  Please note that all 
statistical information is produced from UK data only and does not include Overseas Incidents unless noted as ‘All 
Incidents’. 
 
The contents of this report are split into an overview of the year, and then the details of nine incident categories plus some 
historical analyses.  The various sections can be found as shown below:- 
 
 i) Overview Page  1 
 ii) Fatalities Page 5 
 iii) Decompression Incidents Page  8 
 iv) Injury / illness Page  18 
 v) Boating & Surface Incidents Page  22 
 vi) Ascent Problems Page  27 
 vii) Technique Problems Page  36 
 viii) Equipment Problems Page  38 
 ix) Miscellaneous Incidents Page  40 
 x) Overseas Incidents Page  41 
 xi) Numerical & Statistical Analyses Page  46 
 xii) List of Abbreviations Page  48 
 
 
Within each category the incidents are listed in the order of their occurrence, not necessarily that of Incident Reference.  
They are laid out in the following form: 
 
  MONTH/YEAR OF INCIDENT  INCIDENT REF.    
  Brief Narrative of Incident.................................................................................... 
  ........................................................................................................ 
 
The nature of many diving incidents is such that there is usually more than one cause or effect.  Where this is the case the 
incident has been classified under the more appropriate cause or effect. For instance an incident involving a fast ascent, 
causing decompression illness, will be classified under 'Decompression Incidents'.

Overview 
 
has seen a drop back in the number of incidents 
reported; a total of 379.  The chart below shows 
the total of UK incidents reported annually over 
the last 16 years and it can be seen that after a doubling during 
the 90s, we now seem to be seeing a levelling out from 2000 
onwards to a total of 400 incidents per year.

The distribution of reported incidents is shown in the following 
chart.  As can be seen, 65% of these incidents have occurred in 
the summer period.  This is totally consistent with previous 
years, reflecting the increased number of dives that take place 
during the warmer weather.  
There is a lower than normal number of reported incidents in 
both March and May.  There is no obvious reason for this 
except that Easter was in the middle of April and divers may 
have chosen to centre their dives at that time of year around the 
Easter holiday weekend.

Incidents by category 
The incident database categorises all incidents into one of nine 
major categories, and the following chart shows the distribution 
of the 2006 incidents into those categories.  
The highest number of incidents (105) relate to ‘Decompression 
Illness (DCI)' and this is consistent with previous years. 
Ascent related incidents are the next major category with a total 
of 99 incidents recorded in the group.  In previous reports it has 
been noted that this type of incident is on the increase and this 
year’s number is an all time high.  
Typically these incidents involve a rapid ascent, often with 
missed decompression stops,  However, if such an ascent were 
to have resulted in a DCI then it would have been recorded in 
the more serious DCI category. 
 
More detail on DCI, Ascent and Boat / Surface incidents can be 
found later in this overview together with an analysis of the most 
serious category;  Fatalities.

The pattern of depths in the 0m to 50m range is very similar to 
that normally seen and reflects the amount of diving that takes 
place in these depth ranges.  The number of incidents reported

in the greater than 50m range is 10, which is in line with 
previous years.  One of these incidents was a fatality. 
  
The BSAC advises that no air dive should be deeper than 50m, 
and that dives to 50m should only be conducted by divers who 
are appropriately trained and qualified.   
The recommended limit for divers trained to Sports Diver 
standard is 35m and then only when they have received 
appropriate training for diving at this depth. 
The BSAC recommends that mixed gas diving should be to a 
maximum depth of 80m and then only when the diver holds a 
recognized qualification to conduct such dives.   
 
 
The next chart shows the depth at which the incident started.

Inevitably the data are biased towards the shallower depths 
since many incidents happen during the ascent or at the 
surface.  Critical among these are the DCI cases where almost 
always the casualty is out of the water before any problems are 
noted.  This partially explains the large occurrence of ‘Surface’ 
cases as this includes divers with DCI who have left the water. 
Other surface incidents involve boats and boating incidents.

Divers’ use of the Emergency Services 
Divers’ use of the emergency services shows a monthly 
distribution aligned to the distribution of all incidents, and is 
clearly correlated with the number of dives that are taking place. 
 
Our demands upon the Coastguard service have dropped 
dramatically this year with only 178 incidents reported that 
involved the Coastguard.  This number is the lowest in the last 
9 years where the average has been 211 Coastguard related 
incidents per year.  Only future years will tell us if this 16% 
reduction from the average is an anomaly or the beginning of a 
trend.

Incidents involving helicopters : 105  
 
In 2006 105 incidents involved the use of helicopters, and this is 
significantly lower than the high of 137 recorded in 2005.  105 is 
the lowest use of helicopters recorded in the last 5 years and 
seems to be in line with the overall reduction in reported 
incidents.  Helicopters are often tasked to support searches for 
missing divers and to transport divers with DCI to 
recompression facilities.   
Fatalities 
16 fatal incidents occurred in the UK during the 2006 incident 
year.  This is a little below the average of 17.7 fatalities per year 
over the previous ten years although comparisons of this nature 
need to be made with caution since a small change can make a 
big apparent difference to the comparison.   
2004 saw 25 fatalities and raised concerns that we might be 
experiencing the beginnings of a trend of increasing fatalities.  
At the time the BSAC argued that this unfortunate number was 
simply the result of natural perturbations of very small numbers 
in a very large sample, compounded with the timing of the 
incidents and the timing of our incident year.  The 2005 coupled 
with the 2006 findings indicate that this argument was valid. 
 
4 of the 16 fatalities were BSAC members. 
 
The factors associated with these fatalities can be summarised 
as follows:- 
• One case involved a diver who suffered a heart attack.  
There is a second case (and may be others) which may  
also be included in this group when the full facts are made 
known.  
• Three cases involved divers who were, or who became, 
negatively buoyant and sank.  In one case a diver was at 
the surface, in difficulties, but was unable to remain at the 
surface and sank before he could be recovered.  In two 
other cases divers were negatively buoyant underwater, in 
difficulties, and sank. 
• Seven cases involved separation.   
In each of these cases the separation was not planned.   
Four cases involved divers who became separated from 
their buddies and were then found unconscious or semi-
conscious at the surface.   
The other three cases involved divers who became 
separated underwater and failed to surface.   
• Four cases involved equipment.  In two cases it is likely that 
a rigorous buddy check would have prevented the problem.  
Two cases involved regulator problems, one of which was a 
free flow.  
• Two cases involved solo diving.  One case involved a 
rebreather diver.  The other case was a cave diver whose 
absence was noted 24 hours later. 
• Two cases involved divers running out of breathing gas.  
One case was compounded by buoyancy problems and the 
other involved a free flow which prevented a buddy from 
assisting the casualty.  
• Three cases involved rebreathers. 
• Three cases involved incidents that were initiated or made 
more difficult by water currents.   
• Three cases involved divers with DCI.  Two divers suffered 
fatal pulmonary embolisms and a third diver suffered a 
cerebral embolism.  Two of these cases involved 
uncontrolled ascents but one occurred after an apparently 
normal dive.   
• Two cases involved three divers diving together.  
• One case involved a depth greater than 50m.  This was a 
diver who dived to 66m and surfaced missing all 
decompression stops and suffered an embolism.  
 
Often multiple causes were involved in an incident and in eight 
of these fatal incidents there is insufficient information available 
to be clear about the exact chain of events and root causes. 
 
As stated above only one of these cases involved a dive to 
greater than 50m.  In previous years I have highlighted the 
disproportionate number of deaths related to deep diving.  
Typically there have been 4 to 6 fatalities in this depth range 
and, as I have pointed out before, this must be out of proportion 
to the amount of diving that takes place in these depths.  2005 
saw two deaths from dives deeper than 50m and this year saw 
only one; I hope that this trend holds.   
Incident year 

 ` NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2006

Finally there were three reported fatality overseas.  One case 
involved the double fatality of two BSAC members who had 
been diving to a depth of 80m using rebreathers with trimix.  
The third case involved BSAC members in the death of a non 
member, where the casualty was apparently trapped, lost, 
inside a wreck in a depth of 50m. 
 
 
Decompression incidents 
The BSAC database contains 105 reports of DCI incidents in 
the 2006 incident year, some of which involved more than one 
casualty.  When these multiple cases are counted the result is 
112 cases of DCI. 
This number continues the decline in cases of DCI from a peak 
of 173 individual cases reported in 2002 and returns us to the 
typical levels reported in the late 90s. 
  
An analysis of the causal factors associated with the cases for 
2006 indicates the following major features:- 
35 involved diving to deeper than 30m 
30 involved rapid ascents 
27 involved repeat diving  
15 involved missed decompression stops  
Some cases involved more than one of these causes. 
 
Whilst cases of DCI may have declined, as reported earlier, 
cases of abnormal ascent (rapid ascent and/or missed stops) 
have significantly increased, and it may just be a case of good 
fortune that these abnormal ascents did not resulted in DCI. 
 
 
Some of the ‘Injury and Illness’ incidents are also thought to be 
DCI related, but they are reported by the RNLI as ‘Diver illness’ 
and the cause of the illness is not defined. 
 
 
Ascent related incidents 
In previous years I have highlighted the rise in the number of 
incidents associated with abnormal ascents.  This year’s report 
contains 99 ascent related incidents, the highest number ever 
recorded and a clear indicator that this is an area that requires 
a lot more attention from divers. 
The following analysis reveals some of the issues:- 
 
Basic nature of the report:- 
 88 Rapid ascents 
 32 Missed stops 
Clearly some incidents relate to both the above 
 
Causal factors are:- 
18  Drysuit or BCD issues 
16  Delayed SMB, Mask, Fin problems 
12  Free flows 
10 Out of air 
  6  Weight related issues 
  2  Training  
 
Again some have a combination of the above factors 
 
When all of the above causal factors are excluded 53 incidents 
(53%) remain where a simple loss of buoyancy control seems to 
have been the cause.  Without any of the above perturbing 
factors being present divers have simply been unable to 
correctly control their rate of ascent.  Poor training and lack of 
skill are the only explanations.  These are avoidable problems 
and instructors should make this a priority area for attention. 
 
 
Many DCI cases have their roots in these problems; they have 
been recorded under the DCI heading but the causal factors are 
often the same, so the actual number of abnormal ascents will 
be significantly higher than shown above.   
 
 
Boating and surface incidents 
'Boating and Surface' incidents are the third largest category.  
Recent years have seen a very marked decline in the number of 
these incidents from a maximum of 124 in 1998.  The 2006 
numbers at 66 continue that trend strongly.  The decline in 
these incidents and the increase in ‘Ascent’ related incidents 
has displaced ‘Boating and Surface’ from its traditional second 
place. 
Divers are to be commended for this reduction, it results from a 
combination of less lost divers and less engine failures.  It is a 
subject that has received a lot of attention and it is good to see 
that divers’ actions in these areas have had an impact.  
Incidents in this category often result in calls upon the 
Coastguard and the RNLI and some of the reduction in our 
need for support from the emergency services is down to this 
improvement.   
 
 
Conclusions 
Key conclusions are:- 
• Reported incidents are down this year and suggest a 
levelling off in the number of annually reported incidents at 
approximately 400 per year 
• The number of fatalities is a little below the norm of 
previous years. 
• No new causal factors for fatalities have been identified.  
Continuous skills practice, rigorous buddy checks and 
diving within one’s current ability limits with a slow 
progression to new areas are the critical keys to safe diving. 
• Incidents associated with abnormal ascents continue to rise 
dramatically and attention must be given to training in this 
area and the continuous practice of ascent skills. 
 
As has been stated many times before, most of the incidents 
reported within this document could have been avoided had 
those involved followed a few basic principles of safe diving 
practice.  The BSAC publishes a booklet called 'Safe Diving' 
(latest edition currently being published).  This booklet 
summarises all the key elements of safe diving and is available 
to all, free of charge, from the BSAC website or through BSAC 
HQ. 
 
Remember you can never have too much practice and the 
further you stay away from the limits of your own personal 
capabilities the more likely you are to continue to enjoy your 
diving. 
 
Please browse through the details in this report and use them to 
learn from others’ mistakes. They have had the courage and 
generosity to record their experiences for publication, the least 
that we can do is to use this information to avoid similar 
problems. 
 
Finally, if you must have an incident please report it on our 
Incident Report form, available free from BSAC HQ or via the 
BSAC website.   
As always, your anonymity is assured – great care is taken to 
preserve the confidentiality of any personal information 
recorded in BSAC Incident Reports.

Fatalities 
 
December 2005 06/019 
Brixham Coastguard was alerted by a dive support vessel 
calling 'Mayday' for a missing diver.  The diver had completed a 
dive to 47m.  The group deployed a delayed SMB at depth prior 
to surfacing.  The casualty had reached a 6m decompression 
stop and had deployed his own delayed SMB when he was 
seen to make a rapid ascent to the surface.  Having reached 
the surface the diver went back to a decompression stop, the 
buddy remained at the 6m level. The diver descended past his 
buddy, holding on to the delayed SMB until the line broke; the 
buddy diver attempted to descend after his buddy and had to 
change gas to do so.  The diver continued descending and was 
not seen again.  A full search for the diver was coordinated by 
MRCC Brixham with SARIS information provided by MRCC 
Falmouth, Fowey lifeboat and inshore lifeboats from Looe and 
Fowey searched together with sixteen other craft with rescue 
helicopter R-193 from RNAS Culdrose.  Shoreline searches 
were carried out by Mevagissay and St Austell Coastguard 
teams, the units searched until dark; the diver was not found.  
Searching continued the next day by members of the dive club; 
the casualty was not found.  FATALITY (the deceased was 
wearing a new BCD purchased second-hand and had 
experienced buoyancy problems during the dive).   (Coastguard 
& RNLI reports). 
March 2006 06/067 
A diver was engaged in alternative air source drills in a 
maximum depth of 12m.  The diver used her buddy's alternative 
air source and they rose from 12 to 6m.  At this point the ascent 
stopped but the diver did not replace her primary regulator as 
planned.  The buddy tried to place her regulator into her mouth 
for her but it was not taken.  The instructor then brought them to 
the surface.  The diver was recovered into the boat and quickly 
brought ashore.  Resuscitation techniques were applied and the 
emergency services were alerted.  A paramedic arrived and a 
defibrillator was used.  Resuscitation attempts continued.  The 
casualty was taken by ambulance to hospital but failed to 
recover.

April 2006 06/079 
Two divers entered the water to conduct a drift dive in a 
maximum depth of 12m.  One of the pair was using a rebreather 
with air as the diluent, the other diver was using open circuit 
nitrox 32.  Initially the rebreather diver had difficulties leaving 
the surface.  At the bottom he held onto a rock and his buddy 
had to swim against the current to get to him.  As previously 
agreed, the open circuit diver deployed a delayed SMB.  As she 
deployed the buoy it jammed momentarily and she rose slightly.  
She watched the buoy ascend and then realised that her buddy 
was not there.  She believed that he had started the drift and 
she moved with the current for 15 min.  She then surfaced, 
making a 3 min safety stop at 6m.  Surface conditions were 
rough and initially she couldn't see the boat.  She was 
recovered into the boat and reported the separation.  The 
missing rebreather diver was then seen floating on his back at 
the surface.  Two divers entered the water.  They found that the 
diver was unconscious.  He was recovered into the boat and 
oxygen assisted resuscitation techniques were applied.  The 
Coastguard was alerted.  He was airlifted to hospital but was 
declared dead on arrival. 
April 2006 06/081 
A pair of divers descended a shotline to a wreck.  The wreck 
was on a steeply sloping seabed.  They reached the wreck at a 
depth of 8m and then followed it down to a maximum depth of 
50m, exchanging 'OK' signals as they went.  They started their 
ascent, following the wreck back up.  They exchanged 'OK' 
signals at 40m and again at about 30m.  The next time the lead 
diver looked back his buddy was no longer there.  There was a 
current flowing.  The lead diver looked around for a minute and 
then continued his ascent.  The missing diver was seen by 
those in the boat, floating face down in the water at the surface.  
He was unconscious and did not have his regulator in his 
mouth.  He was recovered into the boat and oxygen enriched 
resuscitation was applied.  The emergency services were 
alerted and a lifeboat with a doctor on board was tasked to 
assist.  The lead diver ascended as fast as he safely could and 
was recovered into the boat.  The boat set off back to the shore 
and was met by the lifeboat.  Further resuscitation attempts 
were made, but the casualty was pronounced dead at the 
scene.  The cause of death was found to be drowning. 
April 2006 06/080 
A rebreather diver conducted a solo dive.  Another diver from 
the same party found him motionless on the seabed.  He 
brought him to the surface and he was recovered into the boat.  
The Coastguard was alerted and resuscitation techniques were 
applied.  A lifeboat was launched to assist.  The boat returned 
to the shore where the casualty was declared dead. 
May 2006 06/088 
A diver and an instructor entered the water from the shore.  
They dived to a maximum depth of 4m.  The diver developed a 
problem at 4m and ascended to the surface.  The instructor 
tried to assist her but she sank again without her mouthpiece in 
place.  The instructor had experienced a free flow and was 
unable to re-descend as he now had no air.  The alarm was 
raised.  The instructor was recovered by into a boat and others 
found and recovered the missing diver.  Resuscitation 
techniques were applied and the casualty was taken by 
ambulance to hospital where she was pronounced dead.

A diver who had been using a rebreather in a maximum depth 
of 24m was found unconscious at the surface.  He was 
recovered into the boat and resuscitation techniques were 
applied.  The Coastguard was alerted and the casualty was 
airlifted to hospital.  He failed to recover. 
June 2006 06/103 
A diver entered the water and started a descent down a shotline 
to a wreck.  After reaching a depth of 8m he returned to the 
surface and was seen to be in distress.  The boat approached 
the diver.  The diver, who did not have his regulator in his 
mouth, let go of the buoy and attempted to swim to the boat.  
After a short distance he sank and did not resurface.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and a search was organised involving 
three lifeboats, a helicopter and a naval warship.  Navy divers 
searched underwater.  The lost diver's body was recovered 
from the seabed four days later.  His drysuit inflation hose was 
found to have been disconnected.  It is thought that the diver 
had attempted to drop his weightbelt but had undone another 
buckle in error.  The cause of death was drowning. 
June 2006 06/114 
Four divers were diving on a wreck to a maximum depth of 
approximately 22m.  One of the divers entered the wreck.  
Another diver then went after him and found him unconscious 
with his regulator in his mouth.  He brought him out and 
recovered him to the surface.  He was lifted into the boat and 
the emergency services were alerted.  The diver was airlifted to 
hospital where he later died.  The diver had a 15l main cylinder 
and a 3l pony cylinder.  After the event the main cylinder was 
found to be full.  A press report of the Coroner's inquest 
suggests that the casualty had 'mixed up his air supply tanks'.  
The cause of death was drowning.

June 2006 06/117 
An instructor and two trainees entered the water to conduct a 
dive.  One of the three missed the shot buoy and was picked up 
by the boat and returned to the others at the buoy.  They 
exchanged 'OK' signals and descended.  They reached the 
bottom at 14m and swam down to a maximum of 20m.  The 
diver who had initially missed the buoy was first to reach 50 bar.  
At this point they deployed a delayed SMB and started their 
ascent.  During the ascent, at about 10m, the diver who was low 
on air started to become buoyant and was pulling them towards 
the surface.  The instructor took him off the line and made 
himself negatively buoyant in order to control the ascent.  The 
buoyant diver then dumped air and they sank back down to 
14m.  They started back up and as they passed the third diver 
the diver who had been buoyant signalled that he was out of air 
and took the regulator out of his mouth.  The instructor gave 
him his own main regulator and breathed from his alternative air 
source.  They exchanged 'OK' signals.   The instructor took hold 
of the diver and they made a fast but controlled ascent to the 
surface.  At the surface the instructor put some air into his BCD, 
removed his alternative regulator and started to orally inflate the 
troubled diver's BCD.  The troubled diver was conscious but the 
regulator was out of his mouth.  The instructor put the regulator 
back into his mouth and shouted at him to keep it there.  He put 
more breaths into the troubled diver's BCD and when he looked 
back at him the regulator was partly out of his mouth again.  He 
shouted at him but got no response.  He laid him back in the 
water and, with some difficulty, released his weightbelt.  The 
instructor then removed the casualty's mask and gave him two 
breaths mouth to nose.  He gave an emergency signal to the 
boat and gave two more breaths.  The casualty was recovered 
into the boat and oxygen assisted resuscitation techniques were 
applied.  The third diver made a normal ascent.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and the casualty was airlifted to 
hospital where he was declared dead.  The cause of death was 
a cerebral gas embolism. 
July 2006 06/131 
Two instructors and three trainees were engaged in a deep 
diving training programme.  An instructor and one of the 
trainees descended a shotline together.  At about 18m the 
trainee indicated that he had a problem with his regulator.  The 
instructor gave the trainee his own primary regulator and they 
started to ascend.  The instructor used his alternative air 
source.  He realised that they were coming up too fast and took 
actions to control their buoyancy.  They then started to sink 
back down.  The trainee became unresponsive.  The instructor 
tried to slow their descent by inflating his BCD.  Whilst doing so 
he lost contact with the trainee.  The instructor made a rapid 
ascent to the surface and the trainee sank down to the other 
three divers.  These other divers brought him to the surface.  
The casualty was recovered from the water and the emergency 
services were called.  The casualty was airlifted to hospital 
where he was declared dead.  He had been using nitrox 33.  
The other four divers were placed on oxygen as they had all 
made fast ascents.  Within 30 min of surfacing three of the 
divers developed 'pins and needles' and all four were airlifted to 
a recompression chamber for treatment. 
July 2006 06/153 
Two divers conducted a dive to 25m for 33 min with a 3 min 
stop at 6m.  4 hours 10 min later they dived to a maximum 
depth of 17m.  Towards the end of the dive one of the pair 
deployed a delayed SMB and they made a normal ascent, with 
a 1 min safety stop at 6m.  At the surface the diver with the 
SMB gave an 'OK' signal and made himself buoyant.  At this 
point he lost consciousness and rolled face down in the water.  
His buddy righted him and started giving him rescue breaths.  
The emergency services were alerted and two divers from 
another boat entered the water to help.  The casualty was 
recovered into the boat and resuscitation techniques were 
applied.  The boat returned to the shore where they were met 
by paramedics.  A doctor arrived and the casualty was declared 
dead at the scene.  The other divers from the party were 
recovered by the assisting boat.  Later it was determined that 
the diver had suffered a pulmonary embolism.

Two divers conducted a dive on a wreck to a maximum depth of 
66m.  After 31 min they made an ascent to 50m.  At this point 
one of the pair appeared to develop a problem.  He then 
deployed a delayed SMB and commenced a rapid ascent to the 
surface.  His buddy tried to assist during part of the ascent then 
re-descended, from an intermediate depth, to complete his 
stops.  The diver who made the rapid ascent arrived at the 
surface missing 90 min of decompression stops.  He was 
recovered into the boat and the Coastguard was alerted.  The 
diver was suffering from chest pains accompanied by shallow 
breathing.  He was airlifted to hospital but pronounced dead at 
the landing site. The diver had been using trimix.  The cause of 
death was a pulmonary embolism.   
August 2006 06/165 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 18m.  During 
his ascent he was conducting a safety stop at 5m when he 
became unresponsive and stopped breathing.  He was 
recovered into the boat and resuscitation techniques were 
applied.  The Coastguard was alerted and the casualty was 
airlifted to hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival. 
 
August 2006 06/177 
The alarm was raised when it was realised that a solo cave 
diver’s car had been left in a car park for over 24 hours.  A cave 
rescue team attended and the diver’s body was located about 
17m into a flooded passageway. It was found that the casualty 
had suffered a heart attack. 
August 2006 06/166 
Four divers were wading across a causeway to conduct a shore 
dive.  Strong currents swept them off their feet and they were 
washed off the causeway into deeper water.  One of the group 
was able to regain his footing.  The three others were swept 
away.  The Coastguard was alerted and a search involving two 
helicopters and three lifeboats was initiated.  Two of the divers 
were quickly recovered but the fourth was not found for an hour.  
She was found about 200m out to sea.  She was taken to 
hospital but died later.

Decompression Incidents 
 
October 2005 06/296 
Dive support vessel contacted Portland Coastguard reporting 
having a diver aboard suffering from suspected DCI following a 
25m dive on nitrox for 5 min only, the diver suffered a blackout 
at depth, however managed to reach the surface when the 
alarm was raised.  Coastguard rescue helicopter R-WB airlifted 
the casualty to the HLS where it was met by Poole Coastguard 
a diving doctor and ambulance, the diver was transferred to 
chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
October 2005 06/008 
A diver surfaced from a 36 min dive to 47m and reported that he 
had missed decompression stops.  He had a tingling sensation 
all over his body and joint pains.  The Coastguard was alerted.  
He was transferred to a lifeboat and then airlifted to a 
recompression facility for treatment. 
October 2005 06/303 
Portland Coastguard received a call from the skipper of a dive 
support vessel reporting having dispatched by car a diver 
suffering from suspected DCI following a dive to 40.4m, a medi-
link call was connected, the chamber staff were paged and the 
diver was given treatment.  Note the skipper paged the 
chamber direct, not completing message, confusion as to who 
is coordinating the rescue!  (Coastguard report). 
October 2005 06/256 
A diver conducted a 20 min dive to 20m.  The diver then 
experienced a tingling back pain.  The diver was placed on 
oxygen and airlifted to a recompression facility for treatment. 
October 2005 06/012 
A diver conducted a 26 min dive to a maximum depth of 31m 
including a 3 min safety stop at 6m.  4 hours 29 min later he 
dived to a maximum depth of 25m for 34 min with a 3 min safety 
stop at 6m.  48 min after the second dive he noted a sensation 
of ‘pins and needles’ in his right leg.  He was placed on oxygen 
and the Coastguard was alerted.  He was taken by lifeboat and 
ambulance to a recompression facility.  The symptoms had 
resolved before the lifeboat arrived.  The casualty was given 
recompression treatment.  Five days after the dive the 
symptoms reappeared after a day at work.  Medical advice was 
sought and after a period of rest, the symptoms resolved. 
November 2005 06/308 
Shetland Coastguard was requested by dive vessel for 
assistance for a diver suffering from suspected DCI.  The 
vessel was met by an ambulance and the diver transported to 
recompression chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
November 2005 06/215 
Two divers conducted a dive to a planned depth of 20m.  They 
descended to 13m and then followed the bottom down.  They 
inadvertently went to down to 24m.  One of the pair was heavy 
and struggled with his buoyancy control.  He put air into his 
BCD.  His buddy tried to help and, not realising that the diver 
had put air into his BCD, also put some air into the diver's 
drysuit.  They started to ascend.  During the ascent they 
became separated.  The now buoyant diver made a faster than 
normal ascent to the surface.  His dive duration was 7 min.  At 
the surface they regrouped and swam to the shore.  1 hour 44 
min later they made a second dive to 13m for 22 min, without 
event.  The following day the diver who had made the buoyant 
ascent awoke with severe back pain.  He attended hospital and 
was referred to a recompression facility for treatment for DCI. 
November 2005 06/030 
Clyde Coastguard was made aware of a diving vessel with a 
diver aboard suffering from suspected DCI, the casualty was 
medi- 
linked with a diving doctor and advised to be evacuated to a 
chamber for treatment, Tobermoray and Oban lifeboats were 
launched together with Oban Coastguard and an ambulance to 
take the casualty to hospital.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
November 2005 06/311 
Clyde Coastguard received a call from a group of divers 
reporting having a diver suffering from suspected DCI. The 
divers were medi-linked to a diving doctor who recommended 
the casualty be taken to hospital for examination.  (Coastguard 
report).

December 2005 06/066 
A solo diver using a rebreather with trimix made a dive to a 
maximum depth of 50m.  Just before he started his ascent he 
lost his weightbelt.  He clipped his reel to the wreck and used 
this line to control his ascent.  He was able to complete all his 
stops up to and including his 9m stop.  At this point he had to 
release the reel and he made a rapid ascent to the surface.  
Once on the boat he noticed some pain and the emergency 
services were alerted.  He was airlifted to a recompression 
facility for treatment.  All his symptoms were resolved. 
December 2005 06/313 
Solent Coastguard was alerted by a diving vessel of a diver who 
had made a rapid ascent following a dive to 46m, the diver had 
lost his weightbelt and made an ascent up to 9m up a line.  The 
line stopped and the diver let go, making a final rapid ascent to 
the surface.  The diver began showing signs of DCI and was 
airlifted to QAH for treatment by Coastguard helicopter R-IJ, 
where it was met by Portsmouth Coastguard for onward 
transportation to hospital.  (Coastguard report).

December 2005 06/036 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 44m.  The 
total duration was 27 min.  He was unable to make a stop at 6m 
due to the buoyancy of his new drysuit and he made a rapid 
ascent from 6m to the surface.  After a surface interval of 1 hour 
37 min he dived to a maximum depth of 24m.  He commenced 
his ascent after 22 min and made a 3 min stop at 6m.  He was 
using nitrox 29 but air-based decompression.  At the end of the 
following day he noticed a slight but persistent deep ache in his 
left elbow.  He sought medical advice; it was thought to be a 
strain.  The following day the symptoms remained and he 
contacted a recompression facility.  They advised him to take 
Ibuprofen and stated that they would contact him for progress.  
After a further consultation he went to the recompression facility 
and received two sessions of recompression therapy which 
resolved his symptoms. 
January 2006 06/317 
Stornoway Coastguard received a 999 call requesting 
assistance for a diver suffering from suspected DCI, the diver 
was airlifted to recompression chamber by Coastguard rescue 
helicopter R-MU, the helicopter landing site was prepared by 
Kyle Coastguard.  (Coastguard report). 
January 2006 06/042 
Two divers entered the water from the shore to conduct training 
drills.  They followed a gentle slope down to 9m.  They 
conducted mask, regulator and alternative air source drills and 
made three assisted ascents from 9 to 6m.  After a dive time of 
30 min they started to swim back to the shore.  3 min later, one 
of the divers indicated a problem with his hip, which made it 
difficult for him to fin.  The other diver towed him to the shore 
and onto some rocks.  The diver with the hip problem had 
difficulty removing his fins.  He was not communicating nor 
responding normally.  Others helped to move the diver and he, 
briefly, fell unconscious.  The diver was placed on oxygen and 
the emergency services were alerted.  The diver complained of 
visual disturbances, was cold and had a sore hip.  An 
ambulance attended.  Because of access difficulties the diver 
was airlifted to a recompression facility.  He responded well to 
the treatment and made a full recovery. 
February 2006 06/050 
A diver conducted two dives with a 2 hour 30 min surface 
interval.  The following day he dived to 34m for 36 min with a 4 
min stop at 6m.  Following this dive he developed a pain in his 
shoulder.  He dismissed this pain as he suffered from arthritis in 
that shoulder.  The pain subsided and, after a surface interval of 
2 hours, he dived to 27m for 32 min with no stops.  5 min after 
this dive he experienced the shoulder pain once more.  The 
pain was severe but was again dismissed as arthritis or a 
trapped nerve.  The following evening, after a day spent 
decorating his house, the pain was still noticeable and there 
was some numbness in his right arm.  He contacted a 
recompression facility for advice.  He attended a recompression 
facility and received two sessions of treatment after which he 
was discharged. 
February 2006 06/322 
Clyde Coastguard received a 999 call from a diver suffering 
from DCI, on advice from the doctor the diver was taken by car 
from Seil Island to Dunstaffnage chamber for treatment, Oban 
Coastguard rescue team met the casualty at Oban and 
escorted them to the chamber.  (Coastguard report). 
February 2006 06/051 
Two divers entered the water to conduct a wreck dive.  Upon 
entry, the pony regulator of one of the divers free flowed.  The 
cylinder was switched off.  They descended the shotline and at 
the bottom of the line the cylinder was turned back on; its 
contents were down to 20 bar.  They completed the dive, to a 
maximum depth of 28m, and deployed a delayed SMB to make 
their ascent.  At about 12m the diver who had had the free flow 
lost control of his buoyancy and made a rapid ascent to 4m.  At 
the start of the rapid ascent his computer indicated that he 
needed to complete a 2 min stop at 3m.   He re-descended to 
10m and rejoined his buddy.  They completed a normal ascent.  
About 15 min after surfacing the diver who had made the rapid 
ascent reported an ache in his shoulder.  He was placed on 
oxygen and his symptoms resolved.  Once ashore they sought 
medical advice and the diver went to a recompression facility.  
He was recompressed and his symptoms were fully resolved.  It 
was thought that the diver was underweighted, especially noting 
his empty pony cylinder. 
February 2006 06/056 
A diver conducted a 39 min dive to 35m, with a 2 min stop at 
20m, a 2 min stop at 9m and a 5 min stop at 6m.  After this dive 
he noticed 'pins and needles' in his left leg and a slight 
numbness in his lower back, torso, ribcage and left hand.  He 
was placed on oxygen.  His symptoms persisted.  Medical 
advice was sought.  The diver was taken into an ambulance but 
refused to be taken to hospital.  The casualty was given 
recompression treatment the following day for a spinal DCI.  He 
received two further treatments over the next two days. 
February 2006 06/323 
Clyde Coastguard received a call from dive vessel reporting 
having a diver aboard suffering from suspected DCI. Following 
a medi-link call the diver was transferred to recompression 
chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
February 2006 06/058 
Two divers descended to 36m.  The BCD direct feed of one of 
the divers jammed in the open position and he made a very 
rapid ascent to the surface.  His buddy went with him.   Others 
offered assistance but the divers stated that they were alright.  
Three days later one of the divers was given recompression 
treatment for a cerebral DCI.  It was anticipated that he would 
need further recompression treatment and make a full recovery.

A diver made a rapid ascent from 18m, lost consciousness and 
then recovered at the surface.  The diver then experienced 
chest pain and produced bloodstained sputum.  The diver was 
placed on oxygen and airlifted to a recompression facility for 
treatment. 
March 2006 06/326 
Shetland Coastguard received a call from dive boat reporting 
having a diver aboard suffering from suspected DCI, the 
casualty was met by a waiting ambulance for transportation to 
the chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
April 2006 06/076 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 17m.  After 
about 20 min they returned to a 6m ledge where they planned 
to complete a 3 min safety stop.  After 2 min one of the pair 
started to hyperventilate and panic.  Her buddy brought her to 
the surface.  At the surface she continued to hyperventilate and 
was very distressed.  She was placed on oxygen and the 
emergency services were alerted.  She was taken by 
ambulance to hospital.  She complained of chest pains.  Later 
that day she was taken to a recompression facility for treatment.  
She was discharged the following day. 
April 2006 06/086 
Two divers were involved in an instructor training course.  They 
had completed skills training at a depth of 10m.  4 hours later 
one of the divers became ill.  He was placed on oxygen but his 
condition deteriorated.  Medical advice was sought and the 
diver was taken to hospital.  He deteriorated further and was 
taken to a recompression facility for treatment.  It transpired that 
he had conducted two dives to 38m, with decompression stops, 
three days earlier and had experienced flu-like symptoms from 
that point.  It is believed that he was suffering DCI after the 38m 
dives and that the 10m dive aggravated the problem. 
April 2006 06/104 
A diver commenced a dive to a wreck at a maximum depth of 
29m.  He was wearing a new undersuit and felt more buoyant 
than normal during the descent.  He struggled to maintain 
neutral buoyancy on the wreck and his breathing rate 
increased.  After about 16 min he decided to abort the dive.  His 
buddy deployed a delayed SMB and they began their ascent.  
He struggled to control his ascent rate and this increased his 
breathing rate further.  He managed a brief stop at 6m.  His total 
dive time was 21 min.  Once in the boat he complained of a 
headache.  He was placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was 
alerted.  The boat returned to shore and the diver was taken by 
helicopter to a recompression facility.  He received three 
sessions of treatment over the next two days.  He may have a 
check for a PFO. 
April 2006 06/095 
Three divers conducted a dive to a wreck in a maximum depth 
of 27m.  It was planned that one of the divers would practice the 
use of a delayed SMB at the end of the dive.  When this diver 
reached 70 bar she deployed the SMB.  She had difficulty doing 
so and used a lot of air.  At 18m she was down to 38 bar.  She 
tried to reach for her pony regulator but could not find it.  She 
indicated to one of her buddies and in doing so knocked her 
mask which filled with water.  Her buddy gave her his octopus 
regulator but she failed to clear it and took on water when she 
tried to breathe.  Her buddy tried to reel in the SMB and drifted 
away while doing so; this pulled the regulator from her mouth.  
The third diver saw what was happening, found the distressed 
diver's pony regulator and gave it to her, again she didn't purge 
it and took on more water.  She began to choke.  She lost 
control of her buoyancy and came to the surface with one of her 
buddies, missing 7 min of decompression stops.  They were 
recovered into the boat and placed on oxygen.  The Coastguard 
was alerted.  Once ashore they were taken to a recompression 
facility.  The distressed diver was diagnosed with mild DCI and 
was treated.  The other diver required no treatment. 
April 2006 06/097 
Three divers were engaged in a dive to a maximum depth of 
30m.  Towards the end of this dive one of the three became 
separated from the others at a depth of about 15m.  They all 
surfaced and regrouped.  Their dive duration was 34 min.  It is 
thought that the computer of the diver who had become 
separated was indicating a rapid ascent alarm, but other divers 
were not aware of this.  After a surface interval of 1 hour 30 min 
they dived to 21m for 42 min.  The following day the diver who 
had become separated on the first dive was taken to a 
recompression facility with suspected DCI. 
April 2006 06/098 
Two divers descended a shotline to a maximum depth of 43m.  
When one of the pair's computers indicated that 6 min of stops 
was required they swam up to 20m.  They stayed at this level 
for a while.  They conducted an air check; one had 110 bar and 
the other 100 bar.  They then swam through a tunnel.  Visibility 
fell to 1m.  They then started to return to the exit point; however, 
the dive leader took the wrong direction.  They ascended from 
10m to 6m against an underwater wall.  The other diver then 
showed the dive leader that he only had 40 bar left in his main 
cylinder.  He then lost control of his buoyancy and rose to the 
surface, missing stops.  The dive leader kept an eye on him but 
stayed between 6m and 3m and completed 1 min of 
decompression.  The buoyant diver had missed a 2 min 
decompression stop and a 3 min safety stop.  He was placed on 
oxygen and given fluids.  Later that day he began to experience 
symptoms of DCI.  The following morning he sought medical 
advice and went to a recompression facility where he received 
treatment.  His symptoms were resolved. 
April 2006 06/337 
Falmouth Coastguard received a call from diving vessel 
reporting having a diver aboard suffering from facial tingling, a 
medi-link call was established the doctor recommending 
evacuation to recompression chamber, RN rescue helicopter R-
193 was tasked to transport the casualty to the chamber.  
(Coastguard report). 
April 2006 06/338 
Portland Coastguard received a call from a dive boat reporting 
having a diver aboard suffering from suspected DCI, the vessel 
had contacted the chamber direct and subsequently called 
Portland Coastguard for assistance, the casualty was airlifted 
by Coastguard helicopter R-WB.  (Coastguard report). 
April 2006 06/100 
Two divers descended a shotline to a wreck.  They settled on 
top of the wreck at a depth of 24m.  The underwater visibility 
was low.  After 22 min they began to deploy a delayed SMB.  
There was a current flowing over the wreck and the diver found 
it difficult to deploy the buoy.  The divers' computers indicated a 
requirement for several minutes of decompression stops.  One 
diver held the reel, the other inflated the buoy.  As the buoy 
ascended the reel jammed and the diver holding it was pulled 
upwards.  The other diver went with him, took hold of a torch 
that was hanging from him and tried to slow the ascent.  He was 
unable to halt the ascent and, at about 9m, he let go of the 
buoyant diver who was carried to the surface.  The other diver 
attempted to fin downwards but, inverted, he was unable to 
dump air from his suit.  He rose from 8m to the surface in 30

sec.  Both divers were recovered from the water and placed on 
oxygen.  One of the divers' computers indicated that he had 
missed 2 min of decompression stops.  Within 5 min he 
experienced a tingling sensation in his right and then both legs.  
The Coastguard was alerted and the divers were airlifted to a 
recompression facility.  Both divers were recompressed and all 
symptoms were resolved.  The diver who made the buoyant 
ascent had been using a drysuit for only the second time in 
open water.

Portland Coastguard received a call from a dive boat reporting 
having a diver aboard suffering from suspected DCI, the 
casualty was med-linked with a diving doctor who 
recommended immediate evacuation to a recompression 
chamber.  Portland Coastguard tasked Coastguard rescue 
helicopter R.WB to recover the casualty, the helicopter was met 
by Poole Coastguard, ambulance and a doctor for 
transportation, the casualty had a skin DCI and loss of power to 
arms.  (Coastguard report).

A diver conducted a series of three dives.  Then, after a surface 
interval of nearly 24 hours, he dived to a maximum depth of 
28m for 30 min with a 1 min stop at 6m.  During the ascent, at 
about 10m, he felt a pain in his ear; he thought that this was a 
reversed ear problem and descended a couple of metres and 
then ascended more slowly.  Back on the boat he felt fine and 
he drove the boat back to the shore which took 45 min.  Once 
ashore he began to feel dizzy and within 5 min he could not 
stand.  He was given oxygen and the emergency services were 
called.  He was taken by ambulance and lifeboat to a 
recompression facility where he received a series of seven 
treatments over a four day period. 
May 2006 06/137 
A group of divers were engaged in an advanced diving course.  
At 20m one of the students lost control of his drysuit buoyancy.  
The instructor signalled the other divers to ascend.  At 14m one 
of the others put air into her BCD and also lost buoyancy 
control.  Both divers made rapid ascents to the surface.  Their 
dive duration was 16 min.  They were placed on oxygen and 
medical advice was sought by phone.  The divers were taken, 
on oxygen, to a recompression facility.  The diver who had 
made the rapid ascent from 20m was given recompression 
treatment for symptoms of DCI; the other diver did not require 
treatment. 
May 2006 06/108 
A diver conducted a dive to 9m for a duration of 20 min.  Later 
that day she dived to 13m for a total of 31 min.  The following 
day she dived to 14m for 25 min including a 5 min stop at 6m.  
About 1 hour later she dived to 15m for a total of 24 min.  
During the ascent a jammed reel of her delayed SMB jerked her 
arm.  Shortly afterwards she felt a sharp pain in her left 
shoulder.  She did not think that the incident with the reel could 
have caused this pain.  Once in the boat she was placed on 
oxygen.  She was taken to a recompression facility and, 
although no symptoms of DCI were found, she was 
recompressed.  This resolved her symptoms. 
May 2006 06/115 
The emergency services were alerted after a diver surfaced 
from 37m missing decompression stops.  The dive boat headed 
for shore and was met en route by a lifeboat.  He was given 
oxygen and on arrival ashore he was transferred to a 
recompression facility by helicopter.  (Media report). 
May 2006 06/138 
A diver entered the water from a boat intending to dive to the 
upper part of a wreck to a maximum depth of 18m.  He 
descended, with his buddy, in low underwater visibility and they 
arrived on the wreck at a depth of 25m.  When his air reached 
50 bar he alerted his buddy.  The buddy deployed a delayed 
SMB and they started their ascent.  At 13m the diver ran out of 
air.  He was unable to find his pony regulator or his buddy's 
octopus regulator and he made a rapid ascent to the surface.  
His dive duration was 19 min.  His buddy made a normal ascent 
and they were recovered into their boat.  The diver who had 
made the rapid ascent did not dive the following day.  The day 
after that he dived to a maximum depth of 10m.  The following 
day he drove home.  He felt very tired, his joints ached and he 
felt very nauseous.  The day after that the symptoms were still 
present and he sought medical advice.  He went to a 
recompression chamber and received one session of treatment. 
May 2006 06/109 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 18m.  She 
experienced problems with her drysuit dump valve.  She 
became separated from her buddy and made a fast ascent to 
the surface.  Once in the boat she complained of dizziness and 
she was placed on oxygen.  Other divers were recovered from 
the water and the boat headed back to shore.  The diver then 
complained of a tingling in her left hand.  The Coastguard was 
alerted and a lifeboat was launched.  The oxygen ran out and 
the diver was placed on nitrox 36.  The lifeboat escorted the 
boat to the shore and the diver was moved into an ambulance 
and placed back on oxygen.  She was taken to a recompression 
facility.

Two divers entered the water to dive to a wreck at a maximum 
depth of 37m.  One of the pair was using a rebreather.  They 
descended a lobster pot line.  It was a long line and they found 
it tangled in their shotline.  The rebreather diver switched his set 
point to 1.3 once he was below 20m.  On the wreck they began 
to explore.  The rebreather diver found a valve and attached his 
lifting bag to it.  He turned to ask his buddy to inflate the bag but 
the buddy had gone.  He filled the bag from his back-up 
regulator and allowed it to surface.  He continued the dive and 
found his buddy who was in the process of lifting the shot 
weight.  They ascended a lobster pot line.  The rebreather diver

was slower than his buddy and he was last up the line.  At 20m 
he noticed that the line was moving down towards him, pulled 
down as the supporting buoy was too small.  He let go of the 
line and started to deployed a delayed SMB.  However the reel 
jammed.  While trying to free the reel he noticed that he didn't 
have sufficient air in the rebreather to allow him to take a full 
breath.  He ascended without enough air to breathe.  He 
attempted to add air manually but this did not work.  He 
continued to ascend hoping that the air in the rebreather would 
expand sufficiently to allow a full breath.  He was carried 
buoyantly to the surface missing decompression stops.  His 
dive duration was 45 min.  He shouted for help and was 
recovered into the boat.  He was placed on oxygen and the 
Coastguard was alerted.  His buddy was recovered some 
minutes later.  The rebreather diver drifted in and out of 
consciousness.  He was airlifted to a recompression facility 
where he received two sessions of recompression treatment for 
DCI. 
June 2006 06/129 
A diver conducted a 24 min dive to 24m with a 5 min stop at 
5m.  6 hours later she noticed a mottled, itchy red rash on both 
her forearms.  She sought medical advice by phone and sent a 
phone photo of the rash.  She went to a recompression facility.  
She had a reduction in sensation below her left knee and her 
fingers and forearms were tingling.  She was diagnosed with a 
spinal DCI.  She received recompression treatment and a 
further treatment the following day because of incomplete 
resolution of symptoms.  This diver had suffered a DCI nineteen 
months earlier and had been diagnosed with and treated for a 
PFO.  (Report 05/027 relates). 
June 2006 06/121 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 29m and 
made a normal ascent to 6m.  At the 6m stop one of the divers' 
drysuit inflator stopped working and he used his BCD to 
maintain his buoyancy.  The other diver noticed that he was 
starting to sink so he held on to him and used his drysuit 
buoyancy to hold them both.  At that point the other diver's 
inflator failed too; coming out of the suit completely.  This diver 
managed to hold them both using his BCD.  During this time 
they surfaced briefly then re-descended to complete their stops 
at a depth of 5m.  Their dive duration was 45 min including 10 
min of decompression stops.  The following day one of the 
divers developed a headache and a 'slight woolly feeling' down 
one side.  He sought medical advice and received three 
sessions of recompression therapy.  His symptoms resolved.  
The other diver was asymptomatic but also received one 
session of recompression treatment. 
June 2006 06/136 
A diver, using air, conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 30m 
for a duration of 46 min including a 1 min stop at 9m and a 10 
min stop at 6m.  Two hours later he started to prepare for a 
second dive when he noticed an itchiness on his left shoulder.  
He discovered a 70mm diameter red rash on his shoulder with 
two blue weals across it.  Another member of the group 
commented that she had had a similar marking two days earlier 
and had sought medical advice by phone.  The diver with the 
newly developed rash did not make the second dive that day; 
he relaxed and drank a lot of water.  3 hours later the rash had 
gone.  No other symptoms were experienced.  Dehydration was 
thought to have been a contributory factor. 
June 2006 06/140 
A diver and his buddy conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 
35m.  They both deployed delayed SMBs to make their ascent.  
The subject diver's dive duration was 54 min including 15 min of 
decompression at 3m.  90 min he dived again, on the same site 
but with a different buddy, to a maximum depth of 36m.   He 
started his ascent when he had 5 min of no-stop time left.  He 
made a very slow ascent and had a total dive duration of 25 
min.  Shortly after getting back into the boat he felt an 
'excruciating' pain in his right shoulder.  He was placed on 
oxygen and given fluids.  The Coastguard was alerted and the 
boat made its way back to the shore.  They were met by the 
Coastguard and an ambulance.  The diver's condition had 
improved and he was taken by ambulance to hospital where 
tests were conducted.  He was diagnosed with a minor DCI 
which rehydration and oxygen resolved.  The diver had been 
using nitrox 26.  The diver reports that he had taken water 
during the day but had also had half a glass of wine some time 
prior to the first dive. 
June 2006 06/346 
Portland Coastguard were alerted by a dive vessel alongside in 
port of a diver aboard suffering from suspected DCI following a 
dive to 29m, the diver had experienced saw tooth diving profile 
during the dive due to current and buoyancy problems.  The 
casualty was transported to recompression chamber by 
ambulance for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2006 06/347 
Falmouth Coastguard received a call from dive boat reporting a 
diver with suspected DCI following a rapid ascent from 27m due 
to inability to vent drysuit.  The vessel was met in harbour by 
Penzance Coastguard, an air ambulance airlifted the casualty 
to DDRC in Plymouth for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2006 06/271 
A diver conducted a 25 min dive to 34m with a 4 min stop at 6m 
and a 9 min stop at 3m.  4 hours later he dived to 13m for 40 
min with a 1 min stop at 3m.  The following day he conducted a 
wreck dive to a maximum depth of 35m.  The plan was to start 
their ascent after 20 min and make decompression stops at 6m 
and 3m.  After 10 min they rose to the upper parts of the wreck 
and headed towards the shotline at a depth of 24m.  However, 
they missed the line and continued back down to 34m.   Having 
overrun their plan they deployed a delayed SMB and made their 
ascent including a 3 min stop at 9m, a 4 min stop at 6m and a 9 
min stop at 3m.  Their total dive duration was 41 min.  At the 3m 
stop one of the pair experienced problems with remaining at the 
stop due to the buoyancy of his drysuit / undersuit.  The diver 
had been trying a new drysuit / undersuit combination.  3 hours 
later, this diver complained of itching on his chest.  He was 
placed on oxygen and given fluids.  After 10 min he felt better.  
Once ashore he sought medical advice and was referred to a 
recompression facility where he received a precautionary 
treatment.  He experienced no further problems but refrained 
from diving on following days. 
June 2006 06/145 
A diver entered the water with an instructor to conduct his first 
dive to a depth of 33m.  They descended a shotline to the 
seabed.  They then attached a distance line and swam around 
the shot weight.  Back at the shot weight the instructor 
demonstrated attaching a delayed SMB to the weight to assist 
its recovery.  When the trainee had a 1 min stop showing on his 
computer they made their ascent.  During the ascent they 
stopped at 22m and 10m to conduct buoyancy checks.  They 
stopped at 6m to allow their computers to clear.  As a training 
drill the trainee then switched to his pony regulator and they 
made a further 3 min stop.  They then switched back to their 
main regulators and ascended to the surface, taking 1 min to do 
so.  The trainee was using nitrox 26 with his computer set to air.  
The instructor was using air.  On their way back to the shore the 
trainee diver began to feel dizzy and he developed a headache.  
His condition became worse and he felt a pain in his chest.  He

July 2006 06/155 
A pair of divers entered the water planning to dive to 50m.  
They descended down an underwater wall and then followed 
the seabed down to reach their maximum depth.  Both divers 
suffered nitrogen narcosis and became disorientated.  They 
decided to ascend in open water, away from the wall.  At 30m 
one of the divers deployed a delayed SMB.  While doing so he 
lost control of his buoyancy.  He had 30 bar remaining in his 
twin-set.  The diver made a rapid buoyant ascent to the surface 
from 25m.  His dive duration was 27 min and he had reached a 
maximum depth of 57m.  The other diver completed the 
required decompression.  The buoyant diver was recovered into 
the boat.  He was placed first on nitrox 53 and then oxygen.   
The Coastguard was alerted and the diver and his buddy were 
airlifted to a recompression facility.  The diver who had made 
the rapid ascent displayed some weakness in his left wrist; the 
other diver showed no symptoms.  Both were recompressed 
and released the following day. 
July 2006 06/163 
A diver conducted a 36 min dive to 29m with a 3 min stop at 
6m.  3 hours later he dived to 26m for 41 min.  About 75 min 
after the second dive he noticed that he had a rash.  Later he 
became unwell; he felt feverish and the rash was still present.  
He was placed on oxygen and taken to hospital.  DCI was 
diagnosed and he was transferred to a recompression facility 
for treatment.  He was reported to be dehydrated on arrival.

July 2006 06/220 
Two divers descended a shotline to a depth of 31m.  During the 
descent one of them became tangled with the line and his 
buddy helped to free him; this caused him some anxiety.  When 
this diver reached 90 bar he alerted his buddy.  The buddy 
deployed a delayed SMB which took 2 min.  As they started 
their ascent the diver who was low on air was now down to 50 
bar.  At 25m the diver signalled that he had 30 bar.  He had a 
pony cylinder with nitrox 50.  His buddy signalled that they 
should ascend to 17m and that he should then switch to his 
pony cylinder.  The diver was unable to access his pony 
regulator and his buddy helped him; the regulator was 
presented upside down due to the way it was rigged.  This diver 
then made a rapid ascent to 9m, regained control and re-
descended to join his buddy at 13m.  They then ascended 
normally with a 3 min safety stop at 6m and left the water.  The 
following morning the diver who had made the rapid ascent had 
altered sensation in his wrists and a small rash on his right 
wrist.  Medical advice was sought and the diver reported to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  His symptoms were 
resolved. 
July 2006 06/363 
Yarmouth Coastguard received a call from a diving vessel 
reporting having a diver aboard suffering from suspected DCI 
following a dive to 25m, the casualty was medi-linked to a 
diving doctor for medical advice, the advice was to airlift the 
casualty to a recompression chamber for treatment.  R-125 
recovered the diver, Gorlestone Coastguard prepared the HLS.  
(Coastguard report). 
July 2006 06/365 
Portland Coastguard received a 'Pan Pan' alert from a diving 
vessel reporting a diver suffering from suspected DCI, a buddy 
pair had completed a dive to 29m when on ascent one diver lost 
buoyancy control and started to ascend in an uncontrolled 
manner, this was corrected by the buddy diver only for the least 
experienced diver to vent all his air from the BCD and descend 
to 26m, at this time the more experienced diver inflated the 
buddy's BCD and both made an uncontrolled ascent to the 
surface.  Both divers were airlifted by R-WB to a recompression 
chamber for treatment, both divers were treated, the more 
experienced diver requiring extensive treatment for a spinal 
DCI, the helicopter was met by Poole Coastguard at the HLS.  
(Coastguard report). 
July 2006 06/191 
Two trainees and an instructor entered the water to conduct a 
drysuit familiarisation dive.  They entered the water and the 
instructor signalled them to descend.  They reached the bottom 
at 6m then followed it down to 12m; exchanging 'OK' signals as 
they went.  Visibility at 12m was low.  One of the trainees 
experienced suit squeeze and she put some air into the suit.  
The air migrated to her boots and she began an inverted 
ascent.  She managed to right herself and stopped the ascent.  
The other trainee went with her.  They became separated from 
the instructor.  The trainees decide to surface.  The diver who 
had been inverted put some air into her suit to start her ascent 
but she became buoyant and made a fast ascent to the surface.  
She ascended from 10m to the surface in about 6 sec.  Her 
buddy followed her.  They exchanged 'OK' signals at the 
surface and then began a descent to try to rejoin the instructor.  
They met him at about 5m and all three surfaced together.  
Once out of the water the diver who had made the rapid ascent 
was placed on oxygen.  She was then told by others at the site 
that she would be able to dive again.  Her computer had 'locked 
out'.  After a surface interval of 2 hours 30 min she dived to 14m 
for 21 min.  Later she experienced symptoms of DCI and 
received recompression treatment. 
July 2006 06/287 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 28m for 57 
min including a 1 min stop at 11m and a 13 min stop at 6m.  2 
hours later he conducted a drift dive to a maximum depth of 
20m.  The duration of the second dive was 37 min with a 1 min 
stop at 6m and a 2 min stop at 4m.  Once back in the boat the 
diver noticed a pain in his left shoulder.  After 5 to 10 min the 
pain increased.  He was placed on nitrox 50 and then oxygen.  
The pain reduced.  The Coastguard was alerted and the diver 
was airlifted to a recompression facility where he was treated 
for DCI.

A diver completed a series of two dives per day over a three 
day period.  On day one the dives were 31m for 57 min with a 
12 min stop at 6m then, after a 3 hour 31 min surface interval, 
to 35m for 66 min with 38 min stop at 6m.  Day two was 16m for 
39 min with a very rapid ascent from 13m at the end of the dive 
followed by a surface interval of 2 hours 22 min, then a dive to 
26m for 66 min including a 20 min stop at 6m.  The final day's 
diving was to 34m for 57 min including a 19 min stop at 6m 
then, after a 3 hour 7 min surface interval, to 34m for 63 min 
with a 29 min stop at 6m.  One hour after the last dive the diver 
experienced soreness in her left breast and a mottling of her 
right shoulder blade.  She was placed on oxygen.  After 11 min 
the symptoms had reduced slightly.  She sought medical advice 
and was given fluids and placed back on oxygen.  She was 
taken to a recompression facility, treated for DCI and 
discharged later that day.  She was advised to seek a PFO test.

Two divers entered the water and dived to the seabed at a 
depth of 15m.  They then followed the seabed down to a depth 
of 24m.  With 3 min of no stop time remaining they started a 
slow ascent.  They deployed a delayed SMB and conducted a 1 
min safety stop at 3m.  Their dive duration was 37 min.  About 
30 min later one of the pair began to feel unwell and had a 
balance problem.  The diver was placed on oxygen and the 
Coastguard was alerted.  8 min after the initial complaint the 
diver's condition deteriorated; he began to shake uncontrollably, 
he started to vomit, his eyes rolled and he was unable to focus.  
Medical advice was sought and the diver and his buddy were 
airlifted to a recompression facility.  The diver was diagnosed 
with a vestibular DCI and he received a series of eleven 
sessions of recompression therapy.  He was reported to have 
made a good recovery and was advised to take a PFO test. 
August 2006 06/371 
Portland Coastguard were informed by a diving vessel of a diver 
aboard suffering from suspected DCI following a dive on trimix

to 51m, the vessel had returned to port when the diver's 
symptoms had developed.  The casualty was transported by 
ambulance to recompression chamber for treatment.  
(Coastguard report). 
August 2006 06/176 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 20m.  After 
20 min they ascended to a shelf at a depth of 12m so that one 
of the pair could practice mask clearing before their final ascent.  
The diver’s first two attempts to clear went well but on his third 
attempt the mask seal rode over his hood and would not seal.  
The buddy attempted to help but the diver became distressed 
and pulled his mask off.  He signalled that he wanted to ascend.  
The buddy tried to replace his mask but he pulled it off again.  
Both divers made a rapid ascent to the surface.  At the surface 
both divers were recovered into their boat.  A few minutes later 
the distressed diver reported that he felt a little sick and that he 
had an ache in his left elbow.  The diver was laid down and 
given oxygen and water.  The seal was removed from a new 
oxygen cylinder but it was found to be empty.  The diver was 
given nitrox.  The diver was airlifted to a recompression facility.  
During the flight the diver was placed on oxygen and the pain in 
his elbow resolved.  The diver was given a single session of 
recompression treatment. 
August 2006 06/178 
A pair of divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 38m.  
After 15 min one of the divers deployed a delayed SMB.  They 
ascended to 21m and made a 2 min stop.  They then ascended 
to 9m.  At this point one of the pair became buoyant, she 
attempted to vent her BCD and her buddy attempted to slow the 
ascent.  The buoyant diver became inverted and the pair was 
carried to the surface.  The buoyant diver’s computer indicated 
that she had missed 7 min of decompression stops.  The divers 
were placed on oxygen.   They attended a recompression 
facility.  The diver who had been buoyant was treated for DCI.  
It was later found that this diver’s BCD inflator valve was 
leaking air into the jacket.  It is thought that this fault developed 
as the divers approached 9m. 
August 2006 06/223 
A diver conducted a 25 min dive to a depth of 26m with a 3 min 
stop at 6m.  2 hours later he dived again, to a maximum depth 
of 21m.  The dive involved lots of finning and one of the pair 
consumed his air quite quickly.  When he reached 70 bar he 
indicated that he wanted to ascend.  However, the other diver 
continued the dive.  When the diver who was low on air reached 
50 bar he again indicated that they should ascend and started 
to deploy his delayed SMB; the other diver assisted him.  In his 
haste to deploy his SMB the diver forgot to dump air from his 
drysuit and was pulled upwards by the SMB.  He moved to 
dump air but developed cramp in his leg.  This delayed him 
dumping air and he was carried from 16m to 5m in about 10 
seconds.  He then spent 3 min surfacing from 5m.  Back on the 
boat he was placed on oxygen and examined for symptoms; 
none were found.  Two days later he started to suffer from 
dizziness, headaches, numbness in his left hand and an aching 
right hand.  He was taken to a recompression facility and 
received treatment for DCI. 
August 2006 06/376 
Two divers made a rapid ascent from 20 m, as they were 
unfamiliar with the wreck they missed the shotline, now over 
time they deployed the delayed SMB which caused them to rise 
rapidly, attempting to dump air the rise was too rapid, arriving 
on the surface with nausea headache and tingling, Portland 
Coastguard were contacted who scrambled Coastguard rescue 
helicopter R-WB to airlift the divers to recompression chamber 
for treatment, the helicopter was met by Poole Coastguard on 
arrival at the HLS.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2006 06/378 
Whilst on ascent a diver made a rapid ascent to the surface due 
to buoyancy problems, the diver was coughing blood and was 
flown direct to casualty hospital by Coastguard rescue 
helicopter R-WB, the diver was then flown to recompression 
chamber for further treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2006 06/205 
A diver conducted a 30 min dive to 47m with a 5 min stop at 6m 
and a 7 min stop at 3m.  3 hours later he dived to 40m for 30 
min with a 3 min stop at 6m.  10 min after surfacing he 
developed severe stomach cramp.  An ambulance was called.  
He took an indigestion tablet and fluids.  5 min later his leg 
'collapsed'.  He was placed on oxygen and taken by ambulance 
to hospital.  From there he was airlifted to a recompression 
facility for treatment. 
August 2006 06/381 
Dive vessel reported having a diver aboard suffering from 
suspected DCI following a dive to 42m, Yarmouth Coastguard 
linked the duty diving doctor to the vessel, the vessel was met 
by an ambulance on arrival at shore.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2006 06/380 
Portland Coastguard were alerted by a diving vessel of a diver 
aboard suffering from suspected DCI following a two dive day, 
first dive 40m for 40min second dive 2 hours 30 min later to 
24m for 40min using nitrox 36, conducted a precautionary stop 
of 3min at 6m.  Rescue helicopter R-WB airlifted the casualty to 
recompression chamber for treatment, casualty symptoms, pain 
in chest, 'pins and needles', both divers were airlifted, the 
helicopter was met by Poole Coastguard and an ambulance on 
arrival at the HLS.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2006 06/193 
A diver made a rapid ascent from a dive to 40m missing over 20 
min of decompression.  The emergency services were alerted 
and the diver was placed on oxygen.  He was then airlifted to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  (Media report). 
August 2006 06/382 
Dive vessel reported having a diver aboard suffering from 
suspected DCI following a dive to 38m for 23min.  The casualty 
was airlifted to hospital by rescue helicopter R 177, Portaferry 
Coastguard made ready the HLS.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2006 06/208 
Portland Coastguard were alerted by a diving vessel that a diver 
aboard had missed stops following a rapid ascent from a 31m 
dive; the bottom time had been 47min.  One of three divers lost 
buoyancy control and although attempting to re-descend could 
not get down, the divers were recovered and complained of 
tingling.  The casualty was airlifted to recompression chamber 
for treatment by Coastguard rescue helicopter R-WB.  The 
helicopter was met by Poole Coastguard and an ambulance at 
the HLS.  Note the diver had purchased a set of wings and had 
little experience with them, lack of weight made it impossible to 
remain at the decompression stop.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2006 06/386 
Clyde Coastguard coordinated the recovery of a diver from an 
island to the mainland for treatment suffering from DCI.

August 2006 06/251 
A diver conducted a 30 min dive to 30m with a 1 min safety stop 
at 3m.  2 hours 22 min later he dived to 33m for 45 min with a 1 
min stop at 6m and a 34 min stop at 3m.  During these dives he 
experienced problems with his dive computer and in reading it.  
He believes that decompression stops were missed.  He was 
placed on oxygen and taken by ambulance to a recompression 
facility for treatment.  He was released from hospital 24 hours 
later. 
August 2006 06/388 
Yarmouth Coastguard were alerted by a diving vessel, of a 
diver aboard another vessel suffering from suspected DCI, the 
casualty was airlifted by rescue helicopter R Anglia One, the 
helo was met by Coastguard teams from Mundsey, Happisburg 
and Winterton attended, the casualty was taken by ambulance 
to the hospital.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2006 06/387 
Portland Coastguard were alerted to two divers missing 
decompression stops following a dive to 27m, this was the 
second dive of the day and in reverse profile, the divers 
ascended and attempted to deploy their delayed SMB.  Whilst 
this was being done the divers fell back to the seabed, the 
divers completed stops according to the computer and on 
surfacing began feeling ill.  The divers were airlifted to 
recompression chamber by R-WB, being met by Poole 
Coastguard and ambulance.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2006 06/392 
Portland Coastguard received a call from a diving vessel 
reporting having two divers aboard suffering from suspected 
DCI, the divers were airlifted by R-WB to the HLS where it was 
met by Poole Coastguard and an ambulance for transportation 
to a recompression chamber.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2006 06/252 
A diver conducted a series of seven dives over a four day 
period.  Her last dive was to 32m and this was the deepest.  Her 
previous dive had been 19 hours 29 min earlier.  She dived with 
a buddy to a wreck.  There was a 1 knot current flowing.  At the 
end of the dive they ascended the shotline, closely followed by 
another pair of divers.  At a depth of 10m they found a third pair 
of divers on the shotline and they also found that the shot buoy 
had been pulled down to 10m, by the action of the current.  The 
diver deployed a delayed SMB and they left the shotline, the 
second pair of divers came with them.  They sank back to 15m 
before making a normal ascent with a 3 min stop at 6m.  The 
SMB then became entangled with the third pair of divers and 
they abandoned it, making their final ascent without it.  After the 
dive, the diver had a painful left shoulder and tingling and 
numbness in two fingers of her left hand.  This diver had 
suffered from a stiff left shoulder for two years.  She sought 
diving medical advice and they did not propose any treatment.  
Six days later she attended a recompression facility and 
received two sessions of treatment.  She was left with some 
residual numbness which improved with physiotherapy.  It was 
uncertain if this was a case of DCI. 
August 2006 06/228 
A diver conducted a series of six dives over a three day period.  
On the fourth day she dived to 31m for 41 min with a 1 min stop 
at 15m, a 2 min stop at 9m and a 6 min stop at 6m.  3 hours 35 
min later she dived to 18m for 33 min with a 3 min stop at 6m.  
After surfacing she noticed some pain in her left arm.  An hour 
later the pain continued and she noticed a rash on her left arm.  
She sought medical assistance and was placed on oxygen.  
The pain had subsided a little by this time and, after 20 min on 
oxygen, the rash disappeared.  She was then transferred to a 
recompression facility for treatment, after which she was 
symptom-free.  She was advised to take a PFO test. 
August 2006 06/393 
Portland Coastguard were alerted by a diving vessel of a diver 
aboard suffering from suspected DCI, the vessel was in 
harbour, Portland Coastguard requested the ambulance to meet 
the vessel and transport the casualty direct to recompression 
chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard report).

Liverpool Coastguard were alerted to a diver suffering from 
suspected DCI, the casualty was taken to hospital via a land 
ambulance.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2006 06/275 
A diver conducted a series of dives over a three day period.  
His maximum depth was 42m and he used both air and nitrox.  
He then took two days without dives.  On the next day he dived 
to 36m for a total of 62 min with the following stops; 2 min at 
15m, 3 min at 12m, 4 min at 9m, 6 min at 6m and 9 min at 3m.  
His dive gas was nitrox 22.  3 hours later he conducted a drift 
dive to 15m using nitrox 33.  His dive duration was 60 min 
including a safety stop.  20 hours 30 min later he boarded a 
plane for a short flight.  On arrival at the destination airport he 
felt unwell with nausea, dizziness, numbness in his right arm, 
tingling in his face and right arm and hand, weakness in his 
right hand and pain in his right arm and elbow.  He sought 
advice from a recompression facility and was recommended to 
make his way to them.  He was taken by ambulance, on 
oxygen, to the recompression facility where he received a 
series of three sessions of treatment for a neurological DCI. 
September 2006 06/232 
Two divers conducted a 50 min dive to 45m with a 8 min stop at 
3m.  3 hours 58 min later they dived to 33m for 50 min with a 13 
min stop at 3m.  Both dives included stops that were longer 
than required by their computers.  Once back on the boat, one 
of the pair reported that he had twisted his right hip.  This diver 
had a history of slight arthritic pain in this joint.  5 min later he 
reported that the pain was spreading down his right thigh.  He 
lay down and was placed on oxygen.  His right thigh then 
developed numbness and tingling.  The Coastguard was alerted 
and the boat returned to the shore.  The diver was given fluids.  
He was then airlifted to a recompression facility where he 
received treatment for DCI. 
 
September 2006 06/276 
A diver conducted a 41 min dive to a maximum depth of 23m 
with a 3 min safety stop at 5m.  15 min after surfacing she 
developed what she thought was indigestion.  It quickly 
developed into numbness and tingling in the legs, severe 
abdominal pain and then loss of mobility in her legs.  She was 
placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  Once 
ashore she was taken by ambulance to a helicopter and airlifted 
to a recompression facility.  She received a series of treatments 
for DCI over a four day period and made an almost complete 
recovery.

September 2006 06/212 
A diver was on a deep diving training course.  He reached a 
maximum depth of 24m.  At this depth he felt a tightness across 
his stomach and he began to cough.  He panicked and 
ascended from 24m to the surface in about 30 sec.  His dive 
duration was 23 min.  He was placed on oxygen and seemed to 
recover.  He then developed shoulder pain and shock.  The 
emergency services were alerted and medical advice sought.  
He was airlifted to a recompression facility for treatment. 
September 2006 06/244 
A diver using a rebreather with air diluent conducted a 62 min 
dive to 27m with no decompression stops.  2 hours 20 min later 
he dived to 16m for 39 min with no decompression stops.  The 
following day, after a 19 hour 9 min surface interval he dived to 
33m.  The dive duration was 60 min including a 1 min stop at 
20m, a 2 min stop at 14m and a 4 min stop at 6m.  During the 
ascent from this dive he experienced problems with his delayed 
SMB reel and thus made a slower than normal ascent.  At 12m 
his rebreather automatically changed its set point from 1.3 pO2 
to 0.7 pO2 and he was not able to reset it.  He completed all 
required stops.  About 30 min after the dive he noticed that his 
shoulder was itching.  His condition worsened and mottling of 
the skin was noticed.  He was placed on oxygen.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and the boat was met by an ambulance 
when it arrived back at the shore.  He was taken to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  He was discharged later 
that day.

Portland Coastguard coordinated the evacuation of a diver from 
a diving vessel complaining of tingling and ache in the chest, R-
WB airlifted the casualty transferring the casualty to a waiting 
ambulance, the HLS was prepared by Poole Coastguard.  
(Coastguard report). 
September 2006 06/234 
A diver conducted a 40 min dive to a maximum depth of 26m.  
She made a 3 min safety stop at 5m.  Within 1 min of leaving 
the water she felt light-headed, disorientated, weak, fatigued 
and almost unable to stand.  She was assisted to remove her 
kit.  She had a tingling in both hands from tight drysuit wrist 
seats which was normal for her.  She also had a numbness in 
her right hand which was not normal.  She was placed on 
oxygen.  The skipper was unable to contact the Coastguard by 
radio.  The boat returned to the harbour.  An ambulance was 
called by phone.  No signs of DCI were found.  She was kept on 
oxygen for 75 min.  She drove home and attended her local 
hospital the following day where she was given more oxygen.  
The next day she saw her doctor, but no action was defined.  
The following day she sought advice from a recompression 
facility and received a session of treatment.  She experienced 
no further symptoms other than extreme tiredness.

Injury / Illness 
 
 
October 2005 06/006 
A trainee diver complained of feeling unwell after a 30 min dive 
to a depth of 6m.  During the dive he had had buoyancy 
problems but no other issues.  It was thought that the diver was 
tired, having had an early start and other training in the morning.  
He took a day’s rest before continuing his training.  (Linked to 
06/007). 
October 2005 06/007 
A trainee diver completed a 23 min dive to a maximum depth of 
22m.  2 hours 30 min later he dived again.  10 min into the dive 
he was descending a shotline at a depth of 7m when he 
appeared to lose consciousness.  The instructor took hold of him 
and brought him to the surface.  He was recovered into a boat 
and he started to respond.  He was placed on oxygen.  Medical 
advice was sought and the diver was taken by ambulance to 
hospital.  No problems were found.  The diver reported that he 
became unwell while he was trying to clear his ears.  He was 
discharged the following day.  (Linked to 06/006). 
October 2005 06/043 
Two divers dived to a maximum depth of 20m.  One of the pair 
made a fast ascent from 20m to the surface, missing safety 
stops.  His dive duration was 30 min.  About 35 min later he 
started to feel dizzy and had blurred vision.  He was placed on 
oxygen for 30 min and recovered.  No further action was 
reported. 
October 2005 06/009 
A diver conducted a 32 min dive to a depth of 9m.  1 hour later 
he dived to 6m for 14 min.  During the ascent from this dive he 
became dizzy and felt as if he was spinning.  He felt a sharp pain 
in his chest.  At the surface the dizziness stopped.  He gave a 
distress signal and was towed to the shore.  He was placed on 
oxygen.  Medical advice was sought and a reversed ear was 
finally diagnosed. 
December 2005 06/034 
A trainee diver and an instructor entered the water and 
commenced a gradual descent.  The trainee experienced 
problems clearing his ears and they ascended a little.  He 
cleared his ears and they descended to a maximum depth of 6m.  
During the dive the trainee experienced some buoyancy 
problems and they ascended a couple of times during the dive.  
After the dive blood was seen coming from the trainee's nose 
and then from his left ear.  He sought medical advice and a 
suspected perforated eardrum was diagnosed.  He stated that he 
felt no real pain during the dive but he also stated that he had 
had intermittent, long term ear problems that he had not declared 
on his self assessment form. 
December 2005 06/032 
During a boat handling course an RHIB was involved in man-
overboard drills.  As the boat turned sharply it hit rough water 
and a trainee in the bows was thrown into the water and struck 
by the propeller.  He received deep cuts to his left foot and up to 
his knee.  He was taken by ambulance to hospital for treatment.  
It was found that he had also sustained broken bones in his right 
foot.  It is thought that his neoprene drysuit helped to protect him 
from more severe injuries. 
 
 
January 2006 06/039 
At a diving club pool night an individual was engaged in 
swimming lengths of the pool.  After about 30 lengths he was 
observed to stop swimming and just hung in the water.  The 
swimmer behind him noticed and tapped him on the shoulder.  
There was no response and quickly realising that there was a 
problem she rolled him over and called for assistance.  Others 
helped to remove him from the water.  Resuscitation techniques 
were applied including a defibrillator.  The casualty was taken to 
hospital and was reported to have been making a good recovery.  
This person had a history of heart problems. 
January 2006 06/041 
An instructor and two trainees entered the water to conduct 
controlled buoyant lift training.  One trainee acted as the casualty 
for the first period of training.  They rested, out of the water, for 
about 20 min and then began a second session.  The other 
trainee acted as the casualty and lifted her buddy from 6m to the 
surface.  At the surface she let go of her buddy and descended 
feet first to the bottom.  The instructor followed her and found her 
slumped on the bottom, unconscious, with her regulator in her 
mouth and breathing.  He lifted her to the surface with a 
controlled buoyant lift.  At the surface she regained 
consciousness and the instructor and the other student towed 
her to the shore.  No further actions were reported. 
January 2006 06/040 
A diver was loading diving cylinders into a metal storage cage.  
He put one cylinder in and as he was lifting the second one in 
the lid fell and hit him on the head.  He sustained one major and 
several minor lacerations to his scalp.  He went to the local A&E 
department for treatment. 
February 2006 06/059 
A group of five divers were diving on a wreck in a depth of 34m.  
One of the group noticed one of the others in difficulties near the 
shotline.  She was inverted and apparently not breathing.  This 
diver righted her, replaced her regulator and brought her to the 
surface, occasionally purging the regulator as he did so.  At the 
surface he summoned assistance.  They were recovered into the 
boat.  The casualty's buddy had surfaced by this time.  The 
emergency services were alerted and resuscitation techniques 
were applied.  After about 5 min the casualty started to revive.  
She was placed on oxygen.  The casualty, her buddy and the 
rescuer were airlifted to recompression facility where treatment 
was given.  She made a full recovery.  It was later found that she 
had become entangled in netting and fishing line which was on 
the wreck. 
April 2006 06/216 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 21m.  
During the dive one of the pair indicated that he was cold and 
wanted to ascend.  They ascended a shotline, making a 3 min 
safety stop at 6m.  They swam to the shore and left the water.  
Once out of the water the diver who had complained of feeling 
cold stumbled, collapsed onto the ground and started to fit.  He 
then stopped breathing.  His jaw was locked shut so his buddy 
administered rescue breaths via his nose.  The casualty took a 
few breaths and then stopped breathing again.  His jaw had now 
relaxed and rescue breathing via the mouth was applied.  
Another person assisted and gave CPR.  The emergency 
services responded and a defibrillator was used.  The casualty 
was airlifted to hospital where he began a recovery.

April 2006 06/094 
A diver completed one dive and in the afternoon was engaged in 
training drills from the shore.  He was asked to move a buoyed 
shotline.  With his buddy he swam on the surface to the buoy.  
He swam on his back.  He became breathless and took his 
regulator out.  On two occasions water broke over his head 
causing him to 'cough and splutter'.  At the buoy they descended 
to the seabed at 6m and completed an uneventful dive.  The 
following day he developed a cough.  The next day he had flu-
like symptoms.  The day after that he felt unwell, he was short of 
breath, he struggled to climb stairs, he was coughing up froth, 
had hot and cold flushes and was shivering.  The next day he 
went to his doctor and was treated for pulmonary oedema.  Ten 
days later he was fully recovered. 
April 2006 06/328 
Ambulance control reported to Milford Haven Coastguard they 
had an ambulance en route to Dale jetty, where a diver had been 
taken by a dive boat.  The ambulance control were not sure as to 
where the incident had happened but reported the casualty, 40 
years old, to have ingested water and was now not very well. 
Dale CRT was called and found diver, had not actually dived but 
was on the surface preparing to dive when he felt unwell and 
tried to vomit.  He was taken from the water immediately by the

An instructor and a trainee descended to a depth of 4m.  At this 
point the trainee indicated that she wanted to ascend and she 
inflated her BCD.  The instructor took control and they made a 
slow ascent to the surface.  At the surface the trainee was 
distressed and the instructor towed her ashore.  Once out of the 
water the trainee began to vomit frothy blood.  The trainee was 
taken to hospital.  She was found to be suffering from acute 
pulmonary oedema.  It was found that she had a pre-existing 
heart condition that she was unaware of, and this may have 
been exacerbated by the cold water.  She made a full recovery.

Lifeboat launched to help diver with illness.  (RNLI report). 
May 2006 06/187 
Three instructors and their trainees were engaged in a snorkel 
dive session.  One instructor and three trainees swam to a buoy 
which was marking an underwater object and prepared to 
conduct some surface dives.  The dive marshal of the group 
swam over and joined them.  The dive marshal conducted the 
first dive.  She dived down to the underwater object at a depth of 
5m.  She turned to come up but the rope of the buoy line caught 
on her fin strap and she could not surface.  She signalled to the 
divers on the surface.  The instructor swam down and helped her 
to the surface; on the way up the diver who had been caught in 
the rope lost consciousness.  About 0.5m from the surface the 
rope pulled tight and held the unconscious diver below the 
surface.  The instructor surfaced and two of the trainees held the 
unconscious diver's arm while the instructor dived again to try to 
free the rope.  The third trainee swam for help.  They managed 
to cut the rope and brought the casualty to the surface.  She had 
been unconscious for between 1 and 2 min.  At the surface they 
gave her rescue breaths and towed her to the shore.  Once 
ashore she was given further rescue breaths and she started to 
breathe by herself.  The emergency services were alerted.  The 
diver was wrapped in blankets and placed on oxygen.  She was 
airlifted to hospital and spent two days in an intensive care unit. 
June 2006 06/248 
An instructor and a trainee conducted training drills from a boat 
while two other trainees waited in the boat for their dive.  One of 
the trainees had complained of feeling seasick while the first pair 
kitted and, while they were diving, he became unresponsive.  He 
was placed in the recovery position and the boat returned to the 
shore.  Once ashore the emergency services were alerted and 
the casualty was given oxygen.  He was taken by ambulance to 
a playing field and then airlifted to hospital.  It was discovered 
that his collapse was due to low blood sugar, dehydration, 
seasickness and anxiety.  He was discharged later the same 
day. 
June 2006 06/217 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 28m.  The 
current was stronger than expected.  They drifted for the first half 
of the dive and then turned around to make their way back.  
Finning against the current caused their breathing rate to rise.  
One of the pair wedged himself between two rocks and deployed 
a delayed SMB.  The other diver finned hard to get to his buddy 
and to stay with him.  He started to become breathless and felt 
that he could not fill his lungs sufficiently.  He started to develop 
tunnel vision and his head began to 'fizz'.  He got to his buddy, 
they started to ascend and his symptoms cleared once they 
started to drift with the current again.  They left the water.  The 
diver's breathlessness continued on land and during his next 
dive.  He later sought medical advice and he was diagnosed as 
possibly mildly asthmatic and he was advised to take more 
exercise.

A group of divers completed two sets of dives and were returning 
to shore in an RHIB.  The RHIB was on the plane.  One of the 
divers reached for his hat, the boat hit a wave, and he slipped 
and fell onto the cylinder rack and the cylinders.  He complained 
of difficulty breathing.  He was moved into a comfortable position 
and given oxygen.  The Coastguard was alerted and the group 
was met by an ambulance when they reached the shore.  The 
casualty was taken to hospital and treated for a broken rib. 
June 2006 06/342 
Brixham Coastguard was alerted to a diver suffering from 
seasickness with symptoms of vomiting and hyperventilating with 
loss of feeling and tingling arms.  The diver was transferred to 
DDRC Plymouth for observation and treatment.  (Coastguard & 
RNLI reports). 
June 2006 06/348 
Portland Coastguard received a call from a diving vessel 
reporting an injury to a diver as he was entering the water from 
the vessel.  Coastguard helicopter airlifted the casualty to 
Dorchester hospital landing site, where it was met by Wyke 
Coastguard and Dorset ambulance.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2006 06/197 
Two RHIBs were on passage to an island for a training exercise.  
One of the boats, with three people on board, was travelling at 
about 25 knots when it hit a trough in the water.  The people 
were thrown into the air and one landed heavily.  He complained 
of a pain in his lower back.  Once at the island one of the boats 
was moored and the injured passenger was laid down in this 
boat.  The other divers went off to complete their emergency 
training exercise.  This exercise involved a helicopter with a 
doctor on board.  On completion of the exercise the doctor 
examined the injured person and he was airlifted back to the 
mainland.  The injured person attended a hospital and diagnosed 
with a muscle injury. 
June 2006 06/160 
Two divers entered the water to dive to a maximum depth of 
10m.  One of the pair had abandoned an earlier dive due to 
anxiety, the dive leader had done a deep dive earlier in the day.  
During the dive the anxious diver gave an unclear signal to the 
dive leader who did not understand.  The dive continued then the 
anxious diver signalled that he wanted to ascend and then 
immediately moved to the surface.  The dive leader conducted a 
normal ascent including a 3 min stop at 5m because of her 
earlier deep dive.  She kept an eye on the other diver who she 
could see on the surface above her.  Once on the surface she 
found that the anxious diver was in difficulty because of an 
asthma attack. Both divers were recovered into the boat.  They 
attempted to provide the asthma sufferer with oxygen but the 
dive group's oxygen cylinder was found to be empty and the 
boat's oxygen mask did not have an exhaust valve so the diver 
was not able to use it.  The diver was not carrying his asthma 
medication.  An ambulance met the group when the boat arrived 
back on shore.  The diver was taken to hospital.  It was later 
found that the troubled diver had been trying to signal that a seal 
was biting his fins and that this occurrence had caused him to 
have an asthma attack underwater, leading to his rapid ascent. 
July 2006 06/351 
Brixham Coastguard were alerted by a diving vessel by a 'Pan 
Pan' alert of a diver aboard suffering from cold sweats, coughing 
and vomiting following a 77m dive.  The casualty was airlifted by 
RN rescue helicopter R-193 to DDRC Plymouth.  (Coastguard 
report).

The Coastguard was alerted when a diver surfaced unconscious.  
The casualty was placed on oxygen.  A helicopter and a lifeboat 
were tasked to assist.  The casualty and his buddy were airlifted 
to hospital.  The casualty was conscious on arrival at hospital 
and was reported to be making a full recovery.  The lifeboat 
escorted the dive boat back to the shore.  (Coastguard & RNLI 
reports). 
July 2006 06/158 
A pair of divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 
22m.  Towards the end of the dive they were unable to find the 
shotline and one of the pair prepared to deploy a delayed SMB.  
While he did so his buddy moved into a prone position seemingly 
looking at the wreck.  The diver then realised that the prone diver 
was unconscious.  He had his regulator still held in his mouth.  
The buddy immediately inflated the unconscious diver's drysuit 
and they both rose rapidly to the surface.  At the surface the 
unconscious diver was recovered into the boat.  During the 
recovery the SMB line became tangled in the boat's propeller 
and this had to be removed.  Once aboard the boat the casualty 
recovered consciousness and he and his buddy were placed on 
oxygen.  The Coastguard was alerted and a lifeboat was tasked 
to take the divers to a recompression facility.  Both divers were 
given recompression treatment and released a day later.  The 
diver who had fallen unconscious remembers having problems 
with buoyancy in his drysuit boots towards the end of the dive 
and having to hold onto the wreck to try to manage the problem, 
but nothing after that until he was being lifted back into the boat. 
July 2006 06/355 
Portland Coastguard were alerted to a diver who had been 
assisted to the surface by his two companions following a dive to 
34m on nitrox 30, the diver has complained of a feeling of 
confusion at depth, there were symptoms of tingling in his arms 
and a feeling of general illness, the diving doctor recommended 
an airlift to recompression chamber for observation and possible 
treatment.  One buddy accompanied the casualty to the 
chamber, no further treatment given.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2006 06/190 
Two divers conducted a 20 min dive to a maximum depth of 6m.

She was placed on oxygen.  She was sick again.  She was given 
advice on how to seek further medical support and she went 
home. 
July 2006 06/180 
A diver dived to 8m for 21 min.  1 hour 59 min later he dived to 
6m.  During this dive he became unwell and the dive was 
aborted.  His dive time was 18 min.  At the surface the diver 
recovered quickly.  It is thought that the cause was impure air in 
his cylinder. 
July 2006 06/364 
Portland Coastguard received a call from a diving vessel 
reporting a diver aboard feeling unwell following a normal ascent 
from a 30m dive, the casualty complained of suffering from

laid down and given oxygen.  The Coastguard was alerted and 
the casualty was given water and some food, as he complained 
of feeling hungry.  Once the boat reached the shore the casualty 
was taken by ambulance to hospital.  After some food and rest 
he made a full recovery and was discharged from hospital later 
that day. 
August 2006 06/224 
A diver banged her head prior to a dive.  She dived with her 
buddy to 48m for 44 min with a 13 min stop at 6m.  During the 
ascent, at a depth of 15m, she developed a headache.  The 
headache continued after the dive and she did not take part in a 
planned second dive.  At the end of the day the headache 
persisted and she sought advice from a recompression facility.  
They advised her to go onto oxygen and attend the facility.  She 
did as suggested but tests revealed no symptoms of DCI.

min dive to a maximum depth of 12m then, after a 1 hour 30 min 
interval, he dived to a maximum depth of 6m.  He practiced 
ascending using an alternative air source.  At the surface he lost 
consciousness and stopped breathing.  He was recovered from 
the water and oxygen assisted resuscitation techniques were 
applied.  After 4 min he recovered consciousness.  An 
ambulance attended but the casualty refused to go to hospital.  
He saw his doctor later that day.  The casualty reported that he 
was taking medication for high blood pressure but he had not 
declared any health problems in his medical form and had not 
told the dive school. 
August 2006 06/439 
Two lifeboats launched to help diver with illness.  (RNLI report). 
August 2006 06/206 
A diver conducted a 27 min dive to 32m with a 2 min stop at 6m.  
5 hours later she dived to 32m for 33 min with a 3 min stop at 6m 
and a 1 min stop at 3m.  At the end of this dive she climbed the 
ladder onto the boat and then collapsed on to the deck.  She was 
breathless, incoherent and unable to stand.  Her diving 
equipment was removed.  Her lips and fingertips showed signs 
of cyanosis.  She was moved into the cabin and placed on 
oxygen.  After 10 min the cyanosis diminished and she became 
coherent and responsive.  She remained on oxygen for a further 
20 min by which time she was fully recovered.  She did not make 
any further dives and planned to seek further medical advice. 
August 2006 06/226 
Two divers entered the water and started their descent down a 
shotline.  An RHIB from another party ran over the top of the 
divers and one of them was struck on the leg by the propeller.  
The divers surfaced and were recovered into the boat that had 
hit them.  The boat's engine had been in neutral at the time of 
the impact and the diver only suffered bruising.  After a rest they 
completed the dive. 
August 2006 06/446 
A number of divers were using a buoy line connected to a wreck 
to make their ascent.  There was a slight swell and the buoy line 
was moving up and down.  One of the divers who was holding on 
to this line suffered a dislocated shoulder.  He was helped back 
to the boat and dekitted in the water.  Whilst in the water the 
diver was able to relocate his shoulder.  The condition was as a 
result of an old injury; it had become dislocated on a number of 
earlier occasions and he had learned how to resolve the 
condition himself.  He suffered no subsequent ill effects. 
August 2006 06/390

January 2006 06/063 
Two RHIBs were returning from a dive site in rough conditions.  
During the trip one of the outboard engine mountings broke.  
The cox stopped the boat and signalled for assistance from the 
other boat.  They decided to tighten the remaining bolt and to 
continue.  Shortly afterward in rough waves the engine swung 
up clear of the water, twisted and fell back.  It was now facing in 
another direction and this caused the boat to turn very quickly.  
The cox fell from the boat and the kill switch, although attached 
to him, did not work.  The boat ran over the cox at high speed 
and his right leg was hit by the propeller.  His midriff area was 
then dragged into the propeller, with his drysuit tangled in it.  
The engine stalled.  The other person in the boat tried to lift the 
engine but could not because the cox was attached to it, 
underwater.  The cox struggled to get to the stern of the boat to 
breathe.  His suit became untangled and he was able to escape 
and get back in the boat.  His only injury was some bruising.  
His drysuit and undersuit were shredded in the stomach area.

15 min apart.  The first pair finished their dive and ascended the 
shotline.  They were recovered into the boat and the boat was 
allowed to drift while the cox and another diver prepared for 
their dive.  During this time the second pair ascended the shot 
and found that the boat was not in sight.  They hung onto the 
shot buoy in worsening sea conditions.  One of the pair dumped 
his weightbelt to gain buoyancy.  They attempted to hail passing 
yachts.  Eventually their boat returned and they were safely 
recovered. 
April 2006 06/414 
Lifeboat launched to assist dive boat with engine problems.  
(RNLI report). 
April 2006 06/078 
A dive vessel with 7 persons on board made a 'Mayday' call on 
VHF Channel 16, reporting an engine fire whilst diving the 
wreck of the M2 5 miles NW of Portland Bill.  Although the fire 
was believed to have been extinguished, a nearby vessel 
GOOSE evacuated the divers and Weymouth RNLI all weather 
lifeboat launched and towed the TOP GUN safely into 
Weymouth harbour to be met by Wyke Coastguards and a fire 
appliance.  (Coastguard report).

into the water.  Two other dive boats assisted, recovering the 
divers from the water.  One of the divers' drysuits was unzipped.  
A lifeboat attended and towed the capsized boat back to the 
shore.  No subsequent ill effects were reported.  (Media report). 
April 2006 06/105 
A diver entered the water from an RHIB to conduct a solo drift 
dive.  5 min later a pair of divers enter the water with a similar 
dive plan.  They all planned to deploy a delayed SMB to make 
their ascent.  The boat moved in the direction of the expected 
current, however, the current was actually flowing in the 
opposite direction.  The pair and the single diver surfaced to 
find the boat missing.  The boat was unable to locate the divers 
and the Coastguard was alerted.  A lifeboat and a helicopter 
were tasked to search.  The solo diver swam to a nearby island 
and climbed to the highest point.  She was seen by the boat 
party and she and the pair were safely recovered into their boat.  
The Coastguard was informed and the search was called off.

dived those in the boat realised that they were overdue; a 
thunderflash was used and the boat searched for the divers.  
After a further 15 min the boat party contacted the Coastguard 
by mobile phone as the boat's radio did not appear to work.  
The Coastguard tasked two lifeboats and a helicopter to search, 
and alerted other shipping.  The divers were spotted by and 
recovered into a fishing boat 2 hours after they first entered the 
water.  They were transferred into a lifeboat and then taken by 
ambulance to hospital.  One of the divers was wearing a semi-
drysuit and was treated for hypothermia.  The other diver was 
wearing a drysuit.  Both were released from hospital later that 
day.

Portland Coastguard received a 999 call from a diving vessel 
reporting having broken down with divers still in the water, 
Weymouth lifeboat was launched and rescue helicopter R-WB, 
the diver was recovered by another vessel, the parent vessel 
was escorted to harbour by the lifeboat.  (Coastguard & RNLI 
reports). 
May 2006 06/112 
The Coastguard was alerted that two divers were overdue from 
a dive. The divers had been missing for over 70 min before the 
alarm was raised.   A search was initiated involving a helicopter, 
a police launch, two lifeboats and other craft.  A yacht reported 
hearing the divers shouting.  The divers were safely recovered 
from the water 5 miles from their expected exit point. 
May 2006 06/270 
Two divers conducted a 32 min wreck dive to a maximum depth 
of 25m.  When they returned to the anchor they discovered that 
the anchor line had parted from the anchor.  They deployed a 
delayed SMB and made their ascent.  In the boat the cox had 
realised partway through the dive that the boat was drifting.  He 
recovered the anchor line and made his way back to the wreck.  
The wind had taken the boat in one direction and the current 
had carried the divers in the opposite direction.  7 min after the 
divers were due to have surfaced the cox made a 'Mayday' call.  
When the divers surfaced they deployed flags and after a 
further 30 min one of the pair set off his EPIRB.  A search was 
conducted involving a naval vessel, a lifeboat, a helicopter and

May 2006 06/196 
A dive boat was stationed close to a wreck with two pairs of 
divers in the water.  The first pair surfaced and the boat 
approached to recover the divers.  As the boat neared the 
divers the engine cut out and could not be restarted.  The divers 
swam to the boat and the anchor was dropped to prevent the 
boat from drifting away.  The engine was examined but no 
obvious fault was found.  The Coastguard was alerted and 
passed on a message to the boat's shore party who were able 
to launch another boat to assist.  The second boat arrived and 
towed the disabled boat back to the harbour.  Another dive boat 
assisted by carrying some of the divers back.

Two divers had surfaced from a dive and were being recovered 
into an RHIB.  The first diver got into the boat and the second 
diver held on waiting for him to move out of the way.  The cox 
then put the boat into gear and started to drive off.  The diver in 
the water was dragged to the rear of the boat and felt a sharp 
pain in his legs as the propeller passed by.  Others in the boat 
shouted a warning and the cox stopped the boat.  The diver 
was recovered into the boat.  It transpired that the pain that he 
felt was cramp and that he had not been injured. 
June 2006 06/445 
An RHIB was returning from a wreck dive in calm conditions.  
The engine started to make an unusual sound and was 
stopped.  The engine and fuel system were checked and 
nothing untoward was found.  The engine was restarted and 
again it made the unusual sound.  The party was only 1.5 miles 
from their destination so they decided to continue at low speed.  
The noise got worse and the engine started shaking.  It was 
stopped again and inspection revealed that con-rods had come 
through both sides of the engine block.  The boat was 
anchored.  Two other dive boats came by and were hailed.  
One of these boats towed the disabled boat back to the 
harbour.

June 2006 06/161 
Two divers completed a dive to a maximum depth of 36m.  One 
of the pair deployed a delayed SMB to make the ascent.  There 
was a current and the divers drifted with it.  When the divers 
were at a depth of about 26m their boat ran over the SMB and it 
became entangled in the propeller.  The diver felt the reel being 
pulled and, thinking that it may have become tangled in a buoy, 
abandoned it.  The other diver then deployed his SMB and they 
made a normal ascent including planned stops.  They were 
safely recovered into the boat.  The first buoy and reel had been 
damaged by contact with the propeller and another diver had to 
enter the water to free it.

Two divers prepared to enter the water.  Their RHIB dropped 
them close to a shot buoy.  One diver had to swim around the 
back of the boat to get to the buoy.  The current carried him 
away from the buoy.  The current and a heavy swell prevented 
him from getting to the buoy.  He stopped trying and looked to 
signal to the boat but it was not in sight.  His buddy had reached 
the buoy and dived without him.  The diver was not found for 
over 15 min, when those in the boat spotted him, by chance, as 
they made their way back to the buoy having recovered other 
divers.  He was safely recovered into the boat. 
July 2006 06/362 
Milford Haven Coastguard were alerted by a member of the 
public of a diver waving for assistance from an orange dinghy,

Dive vessel reported having broken down with two divers in the 
water.  Coastguard rescue helicopter R-WB was scrambled to 
assist, they located the missing divers and stood by until they 
were safely aboard the parent vessel, the vessel then managed 
to restart one of her engines and make her own way back to 
port.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2006 06/203 
Two divers entered the water to conduct a drift dive over a 
wreck site.  The skipper of the boat asked them to enter the 
water negatively buoyant so that they could descend quickly 
and not miss the site.  The last pair entered the water and spent 
a few seconds at the surface dumping the last of the air from 
their drysuits.  The boat, which was a twin hull design, was 
close to the divers when it was put in gear and the divers were 
carried towards the propellers.  One of the divers' fins was 
caught in one of the propellers and it was cut and torn from his 
foot.  The other diver also had a fin cut and damaged but it 
stayed on his foot.  Others on the boat shouted a warning and 
the propellers were stopped.  The divers were recovered into 
the boat; neither was found to be injured. 
August 2006 06/377 
Diving vessel with 9 persons aboard suffered engine failure, 
Weymouth lifeboat were tasked by Portland Coastguard, the 
lifeboat towed the stricken vessel to shore.  It was later 
discovered the fault to be gearbox failure.  (Coastguard & RNLI 
reports). 
August 2006 06/192 
Three divers were conducting a shore dive.  One of the three 
indicated to his buddies that he was going to surface but that 
they should continue their dive.  When he surfaced the weather 
conditions had deteriorated and the tide swept him out to sea.  
When the pair of divers surfaced they realised that the third 
diver was missing.  The Coastguard was alerted and a search 
was initiated involving three lifeboats and a helicopter.  By the 
time the search started night had fallen and the weather 
conditions were poor, with strong winds and rain.  The missing 
diver eventually swam ashore 4 hours later about 3 miles away 
from his entry point.  He sought help at a local house and 
contacted the emergency services.  He was recovered by an 
ambulance. 
August 2006 06/384 
Portland Coastguard were alerted to a broken down dive vessel 
by a mobile telephone call from a shore contact.  The RHIB had 
broken down with divers in the water.  Weymouth lifeboats were 
launched and some of the dive party got back to their parent 
vessel.  The RHIB restarted its engines and recovered its 
divers, being escorted back to shore by the lifeboat.

An observer on a boat handling course was manoeuvring an 
RHIB in a harbour.  He was reversing the boat from one 
pontoon to another.  The boat swung towards a moored boat 
and the cox over-reacted, accelerated and hit the back of the 
moored boat.  The collision punctured the front section of the 
RHIB and damaged a propeller on an emergency outboard 
engine mounted on the back of the moored boat.  No injuries 
were sustained.

Ascents 
 
 
October 2005 06/255 
A diver made a rapid ascent from 7m and was placed on 
oxygen.  No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
October 2005 06/045 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 36m.  
During the ascent, at a depth of 8m, one of the pair lost control 
of his buoyancy and made a rapid ascent to the surface missing 
all his decompression stops.  He had been using nitrox 26 and 
had switched to nitrox 50 for his stops.  He was placed on 
oxygen for 25 min and monitored.  No adverse effects were 
reported. 
October 2005 06/044 
Two divers commenced a dive to a maximum depth of 20m.  At 
this depth one of the pair was unable to breathe easily and 
made a rapid ascent to the surface.  His buddy tried to slow the 
ascent.  His dive duration was 4 min.  Once out of the water he 
was placed on oxygen.  He reported a slight ache in his 
forearms.  Medical advice was sought and he was monitored.  
No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
October 2005 06/013 
Two divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 
35m.  When their computers indicated the approach of the end 
of no-stop time they moved to the top of the wreck.  They then 
deployed a delayed SMB and started their ascent.  They 
conducted a 3 min stop at 6m until their computers cleared.  At 
this point one of the pair experienced a problem with a tangled 
SMB line and, whilst trying to sort this out, made a faster than 
normal ascent to the surface.  Once in the boat it was found that 
their computers showed missed decompression.  They were 
monitored for signs of DCI but none were observed. 
October 2005 06/010 
An instructor and a trainee commenced a dive to practice the 
use of alternative air sources.  At the start of the dive the 
student had 180 bar in a 12l cylinder and the instructor had 150 
bar in a 15l cylinder.  They descended to a platform at a depth 
of 6m and conducted buoyancy and air checks.  The instructor 
gave a demonstration.  The trainee then gave air to the 
instructor and led an ascent to the surface.  They re-descended 
for further practice.  The instructor demonstrated again.  The 
trainee then gave the ‘out of air’ signal and spat out his 
mouthpiece.  He took the instructor’s octopus regulator and they 
started their ascent.  At 3m the trainee spat out the regulator 
and ‘shut down in panic’.  They made a rapid ascent to the 
surface.  At the surface the instructor swam with the casualty to 
a buoy for support.  Another instructor went to assist and they 
were recovered into a boat.  The trainee was placed on oxygen 
and quickly recovered.  No subsequent ill effects were 
experienced.  Post dive checks revealed that the trainee’s 
cylinder was empty. 
October 2005 06/305 
Clyde Coastguard were made aware of two divers on board a 
diving vessel having made a rapid ascent following a dive to 
34m, the dive vessel was requested to make for port where it 
was met by an ambulance and taken to Cumbrae chamber for 
treatment, the vessel was met by Cumbrae Coastguard.  
(Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
 
October 2005 06/014 
An instructor and a trainee conducted a shore dive to a 
maximum depth of 15m.  The outward leg was uneventful.  
They then turned and swam on a reciprocal bearing.  At one 
point they stopped to allow other divers to pass in front of them.  
The other divers’ fins cause a lowering of the visibility and the 
instructor took hold of the trainee to lead him through.  Once the 
visibility was clear again an air check was conducted.  The 
trainee had 70 bar remaining.  At this point the trainee panicked 
and rushed towards the surface.  The instructor caught up with 
him and dumped air from his BCD, even so the ascent was 
rapid from 6m to the surface.  At the surface the trainee got 
cramp and panicked again.  The instructor towed the trainee to 
the shore and he was placed on oxygen.  15 min later the 
trainee reported that he was coughing up blood.  Medical 
advice was sought and the trainee was taken to hospital.  No 
problems were found. 
November 2005 06/025 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 28m.  One 
of the pair prepared a delayed SMB to make their ascent.  He 
had to untangle the line from the winding knob of the reel.  He 
used the purge on his auto-air to inflate the buoy.  After 
releasing the buoy he lost control of his buoyancy and started to 
ascend.  He threw the reel away from his body but was unable 
to prevent himself from being carried to the surface.  At the 
surface he signalled for the boat to collect him.  He was placed 
on oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  He was taken to 
hospital where tests were made and further oxygen was 
administered.  He showed no signs of DCI and he was released 
later that day.  He thinks that the SMB line may have been 
caught on him in some way. 
November 2005 06/016 
A pair of divers descended a shotline.  One of the pair was 
carrying a fixed SMB and the line of the SMB became tangled in 
the shotline.  The diver abandoned the SMB.  In low underwater 
visibility he could not make his buddy understand that he no 
longer had the SMB.  They dived to a maximum depth of 24m.  
As they surfaced the buddy realised that they no longer had the 
SMB and deployed a delayed SMB.  She left the SMB clipped 
to her during deployment.  The reel jammed and the diver was 
dragged to the surface from 10m.  Her buddy made a normal 
ascent.  The computer of the diver who had made the rapid 
ascent had shown no requirement for stops at 10m but it 
showed an emergency state at the surface.  She was placed on 
oxygen and medical advice was sought.  Medical examination 
revealed no adverse effects and no further action was needed. 
November 2005 06/017 
A pair of divers entered the water to conduct the use of 
alternative air source and mask clearing drills.  They first dived 
to a maximum depth of 15m then they found a flat area at 6m 
and commenced training using alternative air sources.  One 
diver passed his octopus regulator to his buddy, but when it was 
passed back he failed to secure it in its intended position.  This 
diver then took his buddy's regulator and breathed from this for 
a while.  When he reverted to his own regulator he cleared it by 
purging it and this caused a free flow.  He reached for his own 
octopus regulator but could not find it because it was not in its 
normal position.  He breathed from his free flowing regulator 
and ascended rapidly to the surface.  His buddy remained at 
6m.  The diver could not return to his buddy because he now 
had insufficient air.  He signalled distress and the boat 
approached.  The buddy heard the boat and surfaced.  Both

were safely recovered from the water.  Their total dive duration 
was 16 min. 
November 2005 06/027 
A diver conducted a series of three dives.  The first to 15m for 
25 min.  The second after a surface interval of 2 hours 20 min 
to 15m for 37 min and the third after a surface interval of 2 
hours to 8m.  During this third dive her feet came out of the 
boots of her drysuit.  She put some air into her suit but it went 
into her empty boots and she started a feet-first buoyant ascent.  
Her buddy tried to slow her down and helped her to the surface.  
The buddy then went back down to look after some trainees.  
The other divers then surfaced and helped the buoyant diver 
ashore.  Later that evening she found a rash on her wrist, hand 
and leg.  She had aching joints and felt dizzy and ill.  She 
sought medical advice and went to her local hospital A&E.  She 
was advised that DCI was unlikely and spent the night on 
oxygen.  The following morning her symptoms had resolved. 
November 2005 06/028 
Two divers started a dive.  During the descent, at a depth of 
2m, a fin of one of the divers came loose and they surfaced to 
refit it.  They re-descended and, at 6m, the diver who had had 
the loose fin lost control of his buoyancy and rose to the 
surface.  They went down again.  After 13 min they were at 
14m, then they started to drift up, with the diver who had had 
the earlier problems 2m above the other.  The lower diver swam 
up to his buddy and attempted to dump air; they didn't succeed 
and both divers made a rapid ascent to the surface.  At the 
surface the troubled diver had a nose bleed; his buddy towed 
him to the shore and summoned assistance. Once ashore he 
felt faint and nauseous.  He was placed on oxygen.  After 10 
min he had recovered. 
November 2005 06/309 
Falmouth Coastguard was contacted by a diving vessel 
reporting having a diver aboard having made a rapid ascent 
from 15m due to losing his dive gear, the diver was placed on 
oxygen as a precaution and monitored, no further action taken.  
(Coastguard report). 
November 2005 06/257 
A diver made a rapid ascent from 12m having experienced 
multiple free flows.  At the surface the diver was shocked and 
breathless.  The diver was placed on oxygen.  No subsequent ill 
effects were reported. 
November 2005 06/312 
Falmouth Coastguard received a call from a diver who had 
missed decompression stops some 2 hours 30 min earlier, the 
diver was medi-linked to a diving specialist doctor at QAH, the 
diver had made a 39m dive for 40min missing 25 min of stops, 
the diver explained he had surfaced for another cylinder then 
went to 3m to decompress, losing his weightbelt, he then 
ascended.  The diver was suffering from a bleeding ear so 
called the Coastguard as a precaution, the diver was 
recommended to attend an A&E for 6 hours oxygen delivery, 
the diver was taken by private car to hospital 10 miles away.  
(Coastguard report). 
December 2005 06/031 
Three divers dived down a shotline to a depth of 14m and then 
followed a drop-off down to 35m.  After about 5 min they found 
themselves in a downwards current.  They ascended gradually 
to the top of the drop-off in a depth of 22m.  They pulled 
themselves along the bottom, against a current, to a depth of 
19m.  Their dive duration was 17 min and they decided to 
ascend.  One of the three deployed a delayed SMB.  The diver 
with the SMB signalled for the others to let go of the bottom and 
ascend with him on the line.  He let go and took the hand of one 
of the divers and placed it around the line.  This diver then let 
go of his line and took hold of the pillar valve of the diver with 
the SMB.  The diver had become buoyant, the diver with the 
SMB was unable to get to him to help and he dumped air to try 
to slow the ascent.  They were carried to the surface missing 
decompression stops.  Their dive duration was 19 min.  The 
third diver surfaced 2 min later.  Once back in the boat the 
buoyant diver was placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was 
alerted.  The diver was taken to hospital but no subsequent ill 
effects were reported. 
December 2005 06/035 
Three divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 36m.  
With 6 min of decompression stops indicated on his computer 
one of the three deployed a delayed SMB and began an 
ascent.  At this point one of his weights fell out of its pouch and 
despite finning downwards to slow his ascent he was carried 
rapidly to the surface.  He gave the emergency signal and was 
recovered into the boat.  He was placed on oxygen and given 
fluids.  Over 12 min later the other two divers surfaced and the 
boat returned to shore.  Once ashore medical advice was 
sought.  The diver was kept on oxygen and monitored for 
problems.  None were found and no further action was reported. 
December 2005 06/037 
Two divers entered the water to dive to 40m in a quarry.  One of 
the pair was wearing new thermal trousers under his neoprene 
drysuit.  On entering the water this diver was unable to descend 
due to excessive buoyancy.  He added 2 kg to his weightbelt.  
He was still too buoyant and 'in frustration' added a further 4 kg.  
He was now overweight and sank quickly.  He finned down a 
slope to 30m.  He put a lot of air into his BCD to maintain 
neutral buoyancy.  He went over an underwater cliff edge and 
started to descend in visibility of about 1m.  His poor buoyancy 
control caused him to hit the side of the cliff and this released a 
cloud of silt that reduced the visibility to nothing.  He lost his 
buddy and had difficulty reading his computer, which he put 
down to narcosis.  His buddy took his hand and made an 
'ascend' signal.  They started to fin up, but with no visual 
reference and lots of air in his BCD he started a rapid ascent.  
He dumped all the air from his BCD and stopped at 9m.  He 
then started to sink rapidly again.  His BCD would not inflate.  
He then realised that he was still pressing the dump control.  He 
put air into his BCD and stopped his descent at about 23m.  He 
then decided that he needed to be at the surface and made a 
buoyant ascent.  At the surface he spat out his regulator and 
vomited.  His total dive duration was 16 min.  He slowly finned 
ashore.  His buddy made a normal ascent.  The buoyant diver 
was placed on oxygen for 10 min.  He developed no symptoms 
of DCI.  He was left with the feeling that his ears were blocked.  
Four weeks later he still had deafness in his right ear which his 
doctor suggested was due to a blocked eustachian tube.

A diver conducted a dive to a depth of 18m for 38 min with a 3 
min stop at 3m.  30 min later he dived again with a different 
buddy.  They dived to a depth of 34m on a wreck.  During the 
dive the diver became anxious that his decompression 
requirement was mounting and he deployed a delayed SMB.  
His buddy swam towards the bow where the shotline was 
situated but the diver thought the shot was at the stern.  At this 
point his dive duration was 25 min and he had 30 min of stops 
showing on his computer.  He had 80 bar in his cylinder.  He 
began his ascent but lost control of his buoyancy and was 
carried to the surface, missing all stops.  He was recovered into 
the boat and placed on oxygen.  The party included a diving 
doctor and a recompression technician who monitored his

Diver medical.  A link call was established between a dive boat 
and the dive doctor at Aberdeen to receive advice on a diver on 
board who had made a rapid ascent from a dive.  The doctor 
confirmed that recompression was required and the diver was 
delivered to the Millport hyperbaric facility by the dive boat.  
(Coastguard report). 
March 2006 06/259 
A diver got into difficulties, panicked and made a rapid ascent 
from 18m.  The dive duration was 8 min.  The diver ingested 
water during the ascent.  The diver was placed on oxygen for 
30 min.  No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
March 2006 06/072 
Three divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 30m.  
One of the divers was using a drysuit for the third time and she 
had changed the thermal undersuit.  This diver experienced 
buoyancy control problems at 30m.  She became separated 
from the other divers and made a rapid, uncontrolled, ascent to 
the surface.  Her dive duration was 10 min.  She was placed on 
oxygen.  No subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
March 2006 06/073 
Two divers dived to 32m.  At this point the regulator of one of 
the divers began to free flow.  He used his buddy's pony 
regulator and they made an ascent.  They lost buoyancy control 
at about 20m and made a faster than normal ascent to the 
surface.  Both were placed on oxygen.  No subsequent ill 
effects were experienced. 
March 2006 06/074 
A diver made a 28 min dive to 20m with a 1 min stop at 3m.  1 
hour 52 min later he dived again.  He entered the water with two 
others.  They did a buoyancy check at 3m and then descended 
to 5m.  The diver then had buoyancy problems and descended 
to 10m, the others followed.  He then descended to 19m and 
again the others followed.  They then started to ascend.  During 
the ascent one of the other two drifted away from the group and 
the third diver went to bring him back.  During this time the diver 
who had had the buoyancy problems made a rapid ascent to 
the surface.  The other divers surfaced safely and they all met 
up on the surface.   The diver who had made the rapid ascent 
was placed on oxygen and medical advice was sought.  After 
30 min the oxygen therapy was stopped and no further action 
was required. 
March 2006 06/260 
A diver made a rapid ascent after experiencing a regulator free 
flow at a depth of 18m.  The diver was placed on oxygen for 20 
min and no subsequent ill effects were reported. 
March 2006 06/075 
A diver dived to 21m on a training course.  2 hours 34 min later 
he dived again with two others.  During this dive he lost control 
of his buoyancy and started to rise.  The instructor managed to 
slow the ascent but then they started to sink.  They sank to 20m 
then made a faster than normal ascent to the surface.  All 
divers were placed on oxygen.  No subsequent ill effects were 
experienced. 
April 2006 06/077 
Three divers conducted three dives in a day.  Their second dive 
was to 22m for 22 min.  On the third dive one of the three's 
regulators began to free flow.  He used one of his buddies' 
octopus regulator and they made a rapid ascent to the surface.  
The third diver made a normal ascent.  The diver with the free 
flow was distressed at the surface.  He and his buddy were 
placed on oxygen for 30 min.  No further action was reported. 
April 2006 06/084 
Three divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 22m.  At 
20m one of the divers' regulators began to free flow.  He 
switched to his pony regulator and one of his buddies turned his 
main cylinder off.  The buddy did not turn the cylinder back on 
again as the diver expected.  The buddy signalled that he 
should ascend and deployed a delayed SMB which he gave to 
the diver with the free flow.  The diver with the free flow 
ascended and the other two continued their dive.  The lone

diver made a fast ascent to the surface missing a safety stop.  
At the surface the water was choppy and he tried to orally 
inflate his BCD.  While doing so he inhaled water.  He shouted 
for help and he was recovered from the water.  He was placed 
on oxygen for 30 min.  No subsequent ill effects were 
experienced. 
April 2006 06/327 
Shetland Coastguard received a call from dive boat reporting 
having a diver aboard having made a rapid ascent, the diver 
was transferred to hospital for observation.  (Coastguard 
report).

A diver made a rapid ascent after experiencing a regulator free 
flow at a depth of 18m.  The diver was placed on oxygen.  No 
subsequent ill effects were reported. 
April 2006 06/329 
Dive vessel called Shetland Coastguard reporting having a 
diver aboard having made a rapid ascent from 25m, the vessel 
was met by an ambulance and the diver transferred to Hospital.  
(Coastguard report). 
April 2006 06/267 
Two divers entered the water and commenced a dive on a 
wreck to a maximum depth of 37m.  Once on the wreck the 
octopus regulator of one of the divers began to free flow.  
Neither he nor his buddy could stop it.  The mass of bubbles in 
the water made it very difficult for him to see.  He reached for 
his pony regulator and started to breathe from it.  He made a 
rapid ascent to the surface, missing planned safety stops.  His 
buddy followed at a more normal rate.  At the surface the diver 
with the free flow was out of air.  He swam to the boat.  Both 
divers were safely recovered.  The diver who had made the 
rapid ascent was placed on oxygen and taken to a 
recompression facility. 
April 2006 06/096 
Two divers conducted their second dive of the day.  They 
reached a maximum depth of 18m and deployed a delayed 
SMB to make their ascent after 20 min.  The diver who 
deployed the SMB then used his drysuit direct feed to adjust his 
buoyancy.  The valve jammed and this caused him to make a 
rapid ascent from 15m to the surface.  His buddy went with him, 
trying to slow the ascent.  They were recovered into the boat 
and the buoyant diver was placed on oxygen.  The other divers 
were recalled and the boat returned to shore.  The divers were 
monitored, but no symptoms were experienced and no further 
action was taken. 
April 2006 06/334 
Portland Coastguard received a distress call from a diving 
vessel, reporting having a diver aboard who had missed 
decompression stops following a rapid ascent from 15m.  
Coastguard rescue helicopter R-WB airlifted the casualty to a 
recompression chamber where the aircraft was met by Poole 
Coastguard and a waiting ambulance.  (Coastguard report). 
April 2006 06/134 
A pair of divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 35m.  
At a depth of 17m, one of the pair lost control of her buoyancy 
and made a fast ascent to the surface.  During the ascent one 
of her feet came out of her drysuit boot.  She was recovered 
from the water and placed on oxygen.  Her dive duration was 24 
min.  No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
May 2006 06/340 
Falmouth Coastguard were alerted by a dive boat of a diver 
making a rapid ascent from 40m, the diver was administered 
oxygen, Newquay lifeboat attended the vessel, the diver 
developed no symptoms, no further treatment was required.  
(Coastguard & RNLI report). 
May 2006 06/125 
Two divers descended a shotline to a depth of 35m.  At the 
bottom visibility was very low.  After 12 min one of the pair 
indicated that he wanted to ascend.  This diver then began to 
deploy a delayed SMB, however he had a problem with a clip 
and was not able to do so.  The other diver then deployed his 
delayed SMB.  He inflated the buoy with exhaust air from his 
regulator.  The reel appeared to run freely.  The diver then 
realised that he was ascending rapidly.  He was unable to 
release the reel and was carried directly to the surface.  He was 
recovered into the boat and placed on oxygen.  His buddy made 
a normal ascent.  The diver subsequently sought medical 
advice and was given precautionary recompression treatment.  
The dark conditions prevented the diver from realising that he 
was being dragged upwards early enough.  The reel had been 
clipped to his BCD and the line had become jammed between 
two moulded components of the reel. 
May 2006 06/135 
A pair of divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 35m.  
After a while they ascended to a shelf at 22m.  They then 
became disorientated, lost buoyancy control and made a fast 
ascent to the surface.  Their dive duration was 20 min.  They 
were placed on oxygen.  No subsequent ill effects were 
reported. 
May 2006 06/118 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 23m.  
During their ascent, at a depth of 20m, one of the pair breathed 
water through her regulator.  She started a fast ascent.  Her 
buddy managed to slow the ascent at 6m.  The ascent to the 
surface from 6m was rapid.  They gave the emergency signal at 
the surface and she was towed ashore.  She was given oxygen 
and examined for symptoms of DCI.  The troubled diver 
complained of feeling sick.  Medical advice was sought.  The 
troubled diver developed stomach cramps and was put back on 
oxygen and taken by ambulance to hospital.  40 min after 
surfacing the buddy developed a tightness in his thighs and 
calves and he was placed on oxygen.  A few minutes later his 
symptoms resolved.  He too was taken by ambulance to 
hospital. 
May 2006 06/119 
Two divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 
28m.  They were unable to find the shotline to ascend so they 
settled on the bottom and deployed a delayed SMB.  One of the 
divers became agitated that they were incurring decompression 
stop requirements.  The agitated diver reeled in the line and 
they ascended.  The other diver's computer indicated that they 
needed to complete a 1 min stop at 10m plus a 10 min stop at 
3m.  During the 10m stop the agitated diver did not engage the 
ratchet on the reel and they started to descend.  The agitated 
diver then signalled that he was out of air.  The other diver gave 
him his pony regulator.  The agitated diver took two breaths but 
the regulator was not properly in his mouth and he spat it out 
and made rapidly for the surface from a depth of 16m.  The 
other diver surfaced alone making a 10 min stop at 3m.  The 
agitated diver was recovered into the boat and the boat then 
started a search for the second diver, not realising that he was 
conducting stops.  The Coastguard was alerted and a lifeboat 
was launched to assist.  When the second diver surfaced he 
was some way from the boat and it was a while before he was

spotted and recovered.  When the second diver surfaced it was 
realised that the first diver had missed stops.  He was given 
oxygen and monitored for signs of DCI.  No symptoms 
developed. 
June 2006 06/126 
Two divers conducted a dive to 27m for 35 min with a 3 min 
stop at 6m.  5 hours later they dived to 31m.  They deployed a 
delayed SMB and started their ascent.  At 10m one of the pair 
lost control of his buoyancy and made an uncontrolled ascent to 
the surface, missing 7 min of stops.  He was recovered into the 
boat and placed on oxygen.  His buddy was concerned for his 
safety and he surfaced a little later having missed 2 min of 
stops.  He too was placed on oxygen.  Both were monitored for 
signs of DCI.  No symptoms developed and no further action 
was taken. 
June 2006 06/189 
A pair of divers prepared to make a dive to a depth of 34m.  
One of the pair found that her cylinder had somehow lost air 
and was at 70 bar.  She used another cylinder.  Her normal 
cylinder was 10l and the replacement was 12l so she removed 
some of her weight.  They descended to the wreck and, after 25 
min, they deployed a delayed SMB to make their ascent.  The 
diver who had swapped cylinders was too buoyant and she was 
carried rapidly to the surface, missing decompression stops.  
Her buddy went with her.  Their dive duration was 29 min.  They 
were placed on oxygen.  No symptoms were reported but the 
divers did seek hospital advice. 
June 2006 06/128 
Two divers descended a shotline to a wreck in a maximum 
depth of 18m.  At the bottom one of the pair put some air into 
her BCD to achieve neutral buoyancy.  The inflator valve 
jammed and she became buoyant.  She alerted her buddy and 
attempted to dump air.  Her buddy held on to her and slowed 
the ascent.  The diver disconnected the direct feed hose but 
was unable to prevent a buoyant ascent to the surface.  Both 
their computers indicated a fast ascent warning.  Neither 
suffered any subsequent ill effects. 
June 2006 06/343 
Solent Coastguard were alerted by a dive boat of a diver having 
made a rapid ascent from 25m following difficulty deploying a 
delayed SMB, following medical advice the diver was airlifted to 
recompression chamber for treatment by Coastguard rescue 
helicopter.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2006 06/345 
Liverpool Coastguard were alerted to a diver having made a 
rapid ascent from 19m in Coniston water, a medi-link call was 
established with a diving doctor to pass medical advice, 
Liverpool Coastguard requested Helimed 63 and Cambrian 
ambulance service to attend. The casualty was airlifted to 
hospital for treatment, the helicopter was met by Hoylake 
Coastguard on landing.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2006 06/344 
Portland Coastguard were alerted by diving vessel of a diver 
aboard having made a rapid ascent from 25m following a dive 
to 43m. The diver was airlifted by R-WB to Poole hospital where 
they were met by Poole Coastguard and a waiting ambulance 
for onward transportation to recompression chamber.  
(Coastguard report). 
June 2006 06/265 
A diver made a rapid ascent from 24 m.  The diver was placed 
on oxygen for 20 min and no subsequent ill effects were 
reported. 
June 2006 06/122 
Four divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 46m.  
Three of the divers were using rebreathers with trimix and the 
fourth was on open circuit air with nitrox 50 for decompression.  
During their ascent they made a 2 min stop at 27m, a 2 min 
stop at 18m and a 2 min stop at 9m.  They were at 6m with 2 
min of stops remaining when they were caught in a down 
current and quickly carried down to 30m.  The rebreather divers 
all experienced high oxygen partial pressures and they bailed 
out onto open circuit.  Three of the group then re-ascended to 
6m where they deployed a delayed SMB and conducted a 
further precautionary stop.  One of the rebreather divers had 
been swept deeper than the others and had not been able to 
equalise his ears quickly enough.  This diver ascended directly 
to the surface missing 2 min of decompression.  He was 
recovered into the boat and placed on oxygen.  Blood was seen 
to be coming from his right ear.  The Coastguard was alerted. 
The three other divers were recovered; their total dive time was 
40 min.  The boat returned to the shore.  The diver who had 
missed stops was then airlifted to a recompression facility 
where he was given precautionary recompression treatment.  
He did not develop any signs of DCI but was diagnosed with a 
ruptured eardrum. 
June 2006 06/123 
Two divers descended to a maximum depth of 35m down the 
face of a reef.  They then ascended to 25m.  At this point one of 
the pair lost control of his buoyancy and made a feet first ascent 
directly to the surface.  His buddy followed at a normal rate and 
surfaced about 12 min later.  The buoyant diver was recovered 
into the boat and placed on oxygen.  The Coastguard was 
informed.  There were no subsequent ill effects and no further 
actions were reported.  The buoyant diver was using a drysuit 
but did not have ankle weights.  His total dive duration was 12 
min. 
June 2006 06/141 
A diver was ascending from a dive.  At 16m he noticed that he 
was ascending too fast, he raised his hand to dump air from his 
drysuit cuff dump but no air was released.  He rose rapidly to 
the surface.  No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
June 2006 06/144 
A pair of divers conducted a dive to a wreck.  They took 5 min 
to descend to the deck of the wreck in a depth of 26m.  They 
briefly dived to the seabed, at a depth of 32m, to place the shot 
weight for easy recovery.  After 42 min they deployed a delayed 
SMB to make their ascent.  They took 8 min to ascend from 
26m to the surface, making a 2 min stop at 10m and a 3 min 
stop at 5m.  Upon surfacing, one of the divers' computers 
sounded a warning and indicated that a 9 min stop at 9m had 
been missed.  He was placed on oxygen.  No subsequent 
symptoms were reported.  The diver believes that he must have 
mis-read the computer during his ascent. 
June 2006 06/143 
Two divers completed a dive to a maximum depth of 25m.  
Towards the end of the dive the dive leader deployed a delayed 
SMB from the top of the wreck at a depth of 22m.  They took 9 
min to ascent to 6m.  They stopped at 6m for 1 min.  The other 
diver's computer showed that he needed to stop at 4m for 1 
min.  However, at 4m he lost control of his buoyancy and 
ascended directly to the surface.  He was recovered into the 
boat and placed on oxygen.  He developed no symptoms and 
no further action was taken.

A diver was at 35m engaged in a deep diving course.  Her 
regulator began to free flow and she made a fast ascent to the 
surface.  At the surface she was briefly unconscious.  She was 
recovered from the water and placed on oxygen.  She was 
taken by ambulance to hospital from where she was discharged 
later that day. 
June 2006 06/286 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 30m.  He was 
using nitrox 36.  His ascent from 16m to 11m was too quick and 
he went back down to 15m.  His ascent back to 10m was 
normal then he ascended to the surface in 2 min, missing 3 min 
of stops on his computer which was set for air.  Back in the boat 
he was placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  
Medical advice was sought.  No symptoms developed and no 
further action was taken.  It was later found that the function of 
the diver's drysuit cuff dump was impaired by his undersuit. 
June 2006 06/146 
A diver was engaged in a deep dive as a part of a training 
course.  At a depth of 32m she took the regulator out of her 
mouth and rushed for the surface, pulling herself up a line.  Her 
total dive time was 3 min.  At the surface she was helped by 
other divers.  Once out of the water she was placed on oxygen.  
She made a quick recovery. 
June 2006 06/130 
Portland Coastguard were alerted by a diving vessel of a diver 
aboard who had made a rapid ascent from 45m feet first!!  The 
casualty was airlifted to Poole by CG R-WB where it was met by 
Poole Coastguard and an ambulance. The vessel was met by 
Lyme Regis Coastguard on arrival in harbour.   Partly caused 
by lack of dive fitness and familiarity with kit on a deep dive with 
no work up dives.  (Coastguard Report). 
June 2006 06/350 
Brixham Coastguard were alerted by a diving vessel of two 
missing divers, the divers made a rapid ascent from 36m having 
become separated at depth, the divers were recovered by 
parent boat and returned to shore, where they were met by an 
ambulance, the divers were transferred to an air ambulance for 
transportation to DDRC Plymouth.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2006 06/162 
Two divers conducted a 27 min dive to 37m including a 6 min 
stop at 6m.  2 hours 30 min they dived again.  Their second 
dive was a drift dive to a maximum depth of 18m.  As they 
descended one of the pair felt his weightbelt was loose.  He 
tightened it and they began the drift.  The other diver held a reel 
connected to an SMB.  The reel had a lanyard connected to it 
and the diver who had had the weightbelt problem held onto this 
lanyard.  10 min into the dive the weightbelt fell away from the 
diver and he started to ascend.  He was unable to grab the belt 
and he pulled himself down with the lanyard.  This pulled the 
other diver upwards.  The other diver was able to make himself 
negatively buoyant and to turn the buoyant diver into a vertical 
position.  They sank back down to the seabed.  They then made 
an ascent to the surface together.  The ascent was slightly 
faster than normal.  Both divers were placed on oxygen as a 
precaution.  Neither suffered any subsequent ill effect and no 
further action was needed. 
June 2006 06/147 
A trainee diver and his buddy dived to a maximum depth of 
21m.  During the dive the trainee experienced difficulties with 
his regulator.  He signalled that he wanted to ascend.  During 
the ascent he lost control of his buoyancy and made a fast 
ascent to the surface.  His dive duration was 12 min.  He 
arrived at the surface alone and was recovered by others into a 
boat.  Once in the boat he started to recover.  He was placed on 
oxygen and appeared to make a full recovery.  The mouthpiece 
of his primary regulator was perished and this may have 
allowed water to enter as he breathed in. 
July 2006 06/156 
Three divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 26m.  
One of the three was diving with a manifolded twin cylinder 
system that was relatively new to him.  The system had two 
separate regulators and he normally dived with the manifold 
open.  On this occasion the manifold valve was left closed in 
error and the diver was not aware of this.  As the dive 
progressed the diver noticed that his two contents gauges read 
differently; one was falling and the other was constant.  He 
assumed that the gauge was stuck.  He noticed that his low 
gauge had reached 50 bar but did not alert the others.  He 
subsequently believes that he was suffering nitrogen narcosis.  
After a dive time of 35 min this diver suddenly ran out of air.  He 
signalled 'out of air' and attempted to get to one of his buddies' 
octopus regulator.  He was unable to release it from its clip.  He 
then grabbed the buddy's pony regulator which was on a cord 
around the buddy's neck and he breathed from this.  He 
struggled to keep this regulator in his mouth because of the way 
it was secured to the buddy.  The troubled diver could have 
used his own second regulator but, at the time, he did not think 
of this.  The two divers began to ascend but then sank back 
down to the bottom.  The third diver then took hold of both of 
them and brought them to the surface.  They made a rapid 
ascent missing decompression stops.  The first two divers 
needed assistance to get back into the boat.  The diver whose 
pony cylinder was being used was coughing blood.  He was 
placed on oxygen.  The Coastguard was alerted and all three 
were airlifted to a recompression facility.  They all received 
recompression treatment and were released later that day.  No 
symptoms of DCI were experienced by any of the divers.  The 
diver who was coughing blood was found to have cut his inner 
lip by biting too hard on his mouthpiece. 
July 2006 06/157 
A pair of divers conducted a wreck dive.  They descended a 
shotline and arrived on the wreck at a depth of 21m.  They 
swam to the stern of the wreck at a depth of 27m and then 
headed back to find the shotline.  Visibility was poor and they 
were not able to locate the shotline.  The dive leader's computer 
indicated 2 min of no stop time left.  They moved higher on the 
wreck and the computer indicated 6 min no stop time.  They 
were still unable to locate the shotline and they deployed a 
delayed SMB to make their ascent.  The dive leader's computer 
now showed that a 2 min stop was required.  The computer was 
relatively new to him and he mistakenly thought that the stop 
was 6m, when it was actually 3m.  They stopped for 2 min at 
6m but because of the stop depth error the computer still 
showed a 2 min stop requirement.  The dive leader now had 25 
bar remaining and his buddy had 15 bar.  They could hear the 
boat engine near them and the dive leader did not want to try to 
make a stop at 3m so they surfaced.  Their dive duration was 
34 min.  The dive leader's computer went into an error state.  
The divers were recovered from the water and placed on 
oxygen.  A lifeboat was already on its way to the boat because 
of another incident that had happened concurrently.  The divers 
were taken to a recompression facility.  Neither showed signs of 
DCI and no treatment was required.  (Incident 06/158 relates). 
July 2006 06/443 
A diver made a rapid ascent from 9m.  The diver was placed on 
oxygen and suffered no subsequent ill effects.

July 2006 06/266 
A diver made a rapid ascent from 18m.  The diver inhaled some 
water during the ascent.  The diver was placed on oxygen and 
no subsequent ill effects were reported. 
July 2006 06/168 
Three divers entered the water to conduct a wreck dive to a 
maximum depth of 27m.  After a few minutes one of the three 
surfaced in distress.  His dive duration was 9 min.  He was 
recovered into the boat and placed on oxygen.  He stated that 
his regulator had flooded and this had led to him aborting the 
dive and making a rapid ascent.  He was transferred to the 
shore.  No symptoms developed and no further action was 
reported.  The boat was in a party of two that had travelled from 
the mainland to a group of islands.  The additional boat 
journeys made led to the use of the boat's reserve fuel earlier 
than planned.  They set out to return to the mainland but the 
sea conditions worsened, fuel consumption increased and they 
realised that they would run out of fuel.  They sought shelter in 
a safe anchorage off one of the islands and contacted a local 
commercial dive boat by radio.  This vessel towed the two boats 
safely to the mainland. 
July 2006 06/358 
Brixham Coastguard were alerted by a diving vessel of a diver 
having made a rapid ascent from 18m following a dive to 30m.  
(Coastguard report). 
July 2006 06/179 
Two divers dived to a depth of 22m.  At this point one of the pair 
experienced a problem with air in his drysuit boots and he made 
a rapid ascent to the surface.  His dive duration was 14m.  No 
subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
July 2006 06/169 
Two divers were taken to a recompression facility for treatment 
after surfacing too quickly.  (Media report). 
July 2006 06/181 
A pair of divers dived to a maximum depth of 13m.  One of the 
pair lost control of her buoyancy and made a rapid ascent to the 
surface.  Both divers then made several ascents and descents 
before aborting the dive.  Their dive duration was 13 min.  No 
subsequent ill effects were reported. 
July 2006 06/250 
Two divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 
29m.  There was a current flowing and when they were dropped 
into the water one of them missed the shot buoy.  This diver 
was towed back to the shot buoy while the other diver 
descended alone.  They conducted separate dives on the 
wreck.  One of the pair was intent on completing a task on the 
wreck and did not monitor his air.  When his buddy signalled 
that is was time to ascend he stayed on to complete his task, 
extending the dive plan.  They then had to swim against the 
current to get back to the shotline.  As they began to ascend the 
shotline one of the pair had 11 min of decompression 
requirements and the other had 8 min.  At 6m the diver with the 
lower decompression requirement gave his buddy the 'out of air 
signal'; the buddy had 100 bar remaining.  The buddy's octopus 
regulator, which had been working when checked before the 
dive, was found not to be working.  They began to share the 
buddy's main regulator.  The diver who was out of air then let go 
of the shotline which created a pull on the regulator hose.  Both 
began to panic and they made a rapid ascent to the surface.  
They were recovered into the boat and placed on oxygen.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and the boat returned to the shore.  An 
ambulance arrived and the divers were then airlifted to a 
recompression facility. 
July 2006 06/221 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 29m.  After 
about 32 min one of the divers was down to 75 bar and they 
agreed to ascend.  The diver with 75 bar deployed a delayed 
SMB and they started their ascent.  The diver reeled in the line 
but, at a depth of 13m, he became aware that he was spinning 
round in the water.  He thought that the line was snagged 
somewhere behind his head.  Whilst trying to resolve this 
problem he made a rapid buoyant ascent to the surface over 
the following 30 seconds.  His buddy conducted a normal 
ascent.  Both were recovered from the water.  Once ashore the 
diver who had made the rapid ascent developed a headache 
and complained of chest and back pain.  The diver was placed 
on oxygen and medical advice was sought.  After a further 1 
hour the symptoms resolved and no further action was taken. 
July 2006 06/272 
Two divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 
35m.  One was using nitrox and the other was using air.  When 
the air diver had 5 min of stops showing they deployed a 
delayed SMB and started their ascent.  The air diver followed 
the SMB line and the nitrox diver held the reel and wound in the 
line.  The nitrox diver indicated that they should speed their 
ascent, to avoid further decompression penalties.  At about 8m 
the air diver's computer malfunctioned and cleared all 
decompression requirements.  She continued directly to the 
surface without conducting any stops.  Once back in the boat 
she explained that her computer had cleared and that she 
thought that her buddy had signalled that they needed to 
surface quickly because of a problem.  She was placed on 
oxygen and given fluids.  Advice was sought from a 
recompression facility and the Coastguard was alerted.  The 
diver was airlifted to the recompression facility and although 
she had no symptoms of DCI she was given a precautionary 
treatment. 
July 2006 06/367 
Falmouth Coastguard were alerted by a diving vessel of a diver 
having made a rapid ascent from 12m suffering bleeding from 
the ears, a medi-link call was made to the INM recommending 
treatment.  Rescue helicopter R-193 was tasked to recover the 
diver and buddy and airlift for treatment to the DDRC in 
Plymouth.  The dive vessel was met by Mevagissey Coastguard 
to obtain details.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2006 06/372 
Solent Coastguard were alerted by a diving vessel of a diver 
having made a rapid ascent from 33m, the casualty was airlifted 
to decompression chamber for treatment by rescue helicopter 
R-IJ, Hillhead Coastguard team responded to establish the 
helicopter landing site (HLS).  (Coastguard report). 
 
 
August 2006 06/278 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 32m.  At 
the end of the dive they attached a reel to a piece of wreckage 
and deployed a delayed SMB.  One of the divers held the buoy 
open while the other filled it.  As the bag ascended it dragged 
the diver who was holding it open upwards.  She was carried to 
the surface.  She released the clip attaching the line to the buoy 
and it sank back to the diver holding the reel.  This diver made 
a normal ascent reeling in the slack line.  During his ascent he 
met another diver and completed his stops with that diver, using 
his buoy.  The diver who had made the rapid ascent was placed 

  NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2006 
34  ©BSAC - 2006 
on oxygen.  It was not known how the SMB caused the diver to 
be dragged upwards.  She suffered no subsequent ill effects. 
August 2006 06/274 
Two divers dived to a maximum depth of 37m.  One of the 
divers was using a pony cylinder and had not reduced her 
weight accordingly and was thus heavy underwater.  She 
became tired during the dive and, during the ascent, she made 
an unintended sudden descent from 25 to 33m when she 
released air from her BCD.  Her buddy assisted her to re-
ascend.  They made a rapid ascent to the surface, missing a 
decompression stop due to low air.  The diver was exhausted at 
the surface and she was assisted from the water.  She was 
placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  Once 
ashore she was taken by ambulance to hospital for tests.  She 
developed no symptoms of DCI and was discharged 3 hours 
later. 
August 2006 06/279 
Two divers conducted four dives over a three day period to 
depths of about 40m.  After a 22 hour surface interval they 
made a fifth dive.  They descended a shotline to a wreck in a 
maximum depth of 42m.  One of the pair felt too heavy and 
added air to her drysuit but it escaped through the dump valve.  
She then added some air to her BCD.  The diver then noticed 
that she was light and kept having to dump air from her BCD.  
She realised that the inflator to her BCD was continually leaking 
air into the bag.  She disconnected the inflator and they 
deployed a delayed SMB.  She showed her buddy that she had 
disconnected the hose and he mis-understood and tried to 
reconnect it for her, which she prevented.  The reel of the SMB 
jammed and dragged them both upwards.  The buddy was 
holding the reel and also the buoyant diver.  They managed to 
stop at 20m at which point the buoyant diver was having 
difficulties with staying down.  Not wishing to drag her buddy up 
she let go of him and was carried to the surface.  The buddy 
followed at a slower rate.  The buoyant diver had missed 24 min 
of decompression stops; the buddy had missed stops too.  Both 
were recovered into the boat and placed on oxygen.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and the divers were airlifted to a 
recompression facility where they received precautionary 
treatment. 
August 2006 06/374 
Shetland Coastguard was requested to have an ambulance 
standing by for a diver who had surfaced missing 
decompression stops.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2006 06/183 
Three divers dived to a maximum depth of 32m.  At this point 
one of the three panicked and made a rapid ascent to the 
surface.  One of the other divers went with her and the third 
made a normal ascent.  Their dive duration was 6 min.  The 
divers who had made the rapid ascent were placed on oxygen.  
Neither diver suffered any ill effects and no further action was 
taken. 
August 2006 06/202 
Two divers descended a shotline to conduct a wreck dive to a 
maximum depth of 30m.  The shotline was not on the wreck and 
they attached a distance line and moved in the direction of the 
wreck.  The line ran out and they left the reel and continued on.  
They did not find the wreck and returned to the reel.  At this 
point one of the pair had only 80 bar remaining in his 12l 
cylinder.  This diver signalled that he wanted to ascend.  At 24m 
the diver's contents gauge was in the red area and he switched 
to his 3l pony cylinder.  He was starting to panic and his 
breathing rate rose.  He soon used the air in his pony cylinder 
and took the alternative air source of his buddy.  The buddy was 
using twin 12l cylinders.  The divers had ascended and 
descended a number of times during the air switching process.  
They stopped for about 2 min at 6m and then surfaced.  They 
were recovered into the boat.  The diver who had donated air 
complained of a headache.  Both were placed on oxygen for 10 
min and given fluids.  Medical advice was sought and the divers 
were monitored for further problems.  None occurred and no 
further action was taken. 
August 2006 06/379 
A party of three divers dived on a wreck to 30m, the plan was to 
ascend at 100bar, however the party could not find the shotline 
so had to ascend up the delayed SMB line, two of the divers ran 
very low on air, the third shared with one of the divers, during 
the ascent at least one diver made a rapid ascent.  As a 
precaution all three divers were airlifted by Coastguard rescue 
helicopter R-WB to recompression chamber, the helicopter was 
met at the HLS by Poole Coastguard team and an ambulance.  
(Coastguard report). 
August 2006 06/383 
Diver made a rapid ascent from 21m, Dover Coastguard made 
a medi-link call as a precaution, no symptoms were present, no 
further medical attention required.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2006 06/385 
Clyde Coastguard received a call from a dive vessel reporting 
having two divers aboard having missed decompression stops 
following a dive to 34m, a medi-link call was established and 
the divers were met by Oban Coastguard team and a waiting 
ambulance for transportation to chamber for treatment.  
(Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
August 2006 06/227 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 30m.  
They planned a 3 min stop at 6m.  During this stop one of the 
pair lost control of his buoyancy and rose quickly to the surface.  
His dive duration was 30 min.  He was recovered into the boat 
and placed on oxygen.  The other diver completed the stops 
and surfaced normally.  The diver who had missed the stops 
was kept on oxygen for 90 min, no symptoms of DCI occurred 
and no further action was taken.  The dive had been planned as 
a no-stop dive but the divers did incur stops and this caused 
them concern during the ascent and is thought to have 
precipitated the buoyant ascent. 
August 2006 06/447 
Two divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 
33m.  With a 6 min decompression stop requirement showing 
on their computers they deployed delayed SMBs to make their 
ascent.  One of the divers was initially pulled up by the 
ascending buoy but he then seemingly started to ascend 
normally.  His buddy turned to observe two other members of 
his team and when he turned back the diver had gone.  The 
diver had made an uncontrolled ascent to the surface in 1 min, 
missing about 4 min decompression.  The buddy made a 
normal ascent.  The buoyant diver arrived at the surface tangled 
in his buoy line.  He re-descended to 8m for 1 min but the 
tangled line pulled him to the surface.  He was placed on 
oxygen and medical advice was sought by phone.  The diver 
was monitored but no symptoms developed and no further 
action was taken. 
August 2006 06/229 
A diver dived to 36m for 39 min with a 3 min stop at 6m.  Nearly 
24 hours later she dived to 30m for 35 min with a 3 min stop at 

NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2006                          
©BSAC - 2006   35 
6m.  5 hours 16 min later she dived to a maximum depth of 
30m.  During the descent she noticed that one of her BCD 
straps was twisted and the right shoulder dump cord was 
twisted into the strap but still working.  Some time into the dive 
she signalled to her two buddies that she was unhappy and 
wanted to ascend.  She started to rise.  She tried to dump air 
from her BCD but nothing happened.  She attempted to dump 
air from her suit.  She rose from 23m to the surface in 90 
seconds.  Her dive duration was 20 min.  She was using nitrox 
28.  Once out of the water she drank water and breathed nitrox 
40.  No symptoms were noted and no further action was taken. 
September 2006 06/231 
An instructor entered the water with a trainee and another diver.  
As they descended to a platform in a depth of 6m they became 
slightly separated, with one diver descending slowly because of 
previous ear clearing problems.  The instructor then saw the 
trainee sinking face upwards attempting to refit a fin that had 
come off.  He signalled the other diver to stay at the surface and 
followed after the trainee.  He reached her at a depth of 10m.  
The trainee appeared to have regained control but then she 
overinflated her BCD and made a rapid ascent to the surface.  
The instructor followed.  At the surface he assisted the buoyant 
diver out of the water.  No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
September 2006 06/209 
Two divers, using nitrox, descended to a maximum depth of 
33m over a 12 min period.  One of the pair experienced 
problems with his mask.  They made their way back up, 
following a sloping contour.  At 20m the diver with mask 
problems started to become buoyant.  He picked up some rocks 
to help him retain control and, with the help of his buddy, they 
continued their ascent to a depth of about 9m.  At this point the 
rocks were dropped and the diver made a rapid buoyant ascent 
to the surface.  His buddy followed at a slower rate.  The 
computer of the diver who had made the fast ascent indicated 
an ascent warning and he was placed on oxygen for 20 min.  
The buddy's computer was clear.  No subsequent ill effects 
were reported. 
 
September 2006 06/213 
Two divers were diving at a depth of 22m.  The fins of one of 
the divers came off and his buddy helped to refit them.  They 
then started a fast ascent.  They managed to make a 1 min stop 
at 4m.  Their dive duration was 21 min.  A little later the diver 
whose fins had come off became concerned and sought 
assistance.  He was placed on oxygen and made a recovery.  
No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
September 2006 06/211 
Two divers were diving to a maximum depth of 20m.  One of the 
pair became disorientated, lost control of his buoyancy and 
made a rapid ascent to the surface.  His dive duration was 10 
min.  He was placed on oxygen.  No subsequent ill effects were 
reported. 
September 2006 06/402 
Following a rapid ascent Portland Coastguard connected the 
vessel with a diving doctor, the doctor recommended the diver 
be kept under observation, no symptom developed.  
(Coastguard report). 
September 2006 06/448 
A diver made a rapid ascent from a wreck dive to a maximum 
depth of 32m missing decompression stops.  He thought that a 
new combination of drysuit and undersuit may have been the 
root cause of the problem. 
September 2006 06/442 
Two divers planned a descent to a maximum depth of 50m.  
One of the pair was over-weighted and he descended quickly.  
He put air into both his BCD and his suit to regain neutral 
buoyancy.  His buddy followed.  They reached the bottom at 
20m, exchanged 'OK' signals and set off down an underwater 
rock face.  At about 27m the buddy indicated that he had a 
problem with his regulator which was free flowing.  The other 
diver turned his cylinder off and on a number of times but this 
did not resolve the problem.  The cylinder emptied of air.  The 
other diver gave him one of his alternative air sources.  The 
donor diver wanted to deploy a delayed SMB to aid their ascent 
but the diver who was out of air started to ascend.  The donor 
diver was concerned about his need to dump air from both his 
suit and BCD but he over dumped and they sank back down 
from 17m to 22m.  The donor diver's computer indicated that 
they should make a 3 min safety stop, but the diver who was 
out of air took them both to the surface.  No subsequent ill 
effects were experienced.  The donor diver reported that he had 
failed to correctly adjust his weighting for the use of a twin 
cylinder system in fresh water.  He found that he was 3kg over-
weighted.

October 2005 06/132 
Two divers conducted a series of dives together.  One of the 
divers normally used two dive computers but dived with just one 
because the other had a flat battery.  The other diver used a 
computer that she had recently bought second-hand.  On the 
third day of a five day trip both computers indicated that 
decompression stops were required.  They stopped at 6m for 
about 5 min; the second-hand computer cleared first and then 
the other.  Once back on the boat the second-hand computer 
sounded an alarm and locked itself.  The following day they 
dived to 35m.  On ascent both computers indicated a 2 min stop 
at 9m followed by a 18 min stop at 6m.  At this point the second-
hand computer indicated that a further 17 min was required 
whilst the other diver's computer had cleared.  They had 
previously concluded that the second-hand computer must be 
faulty and the two divers decided to ascend.  The second-hand 
computer was checked and no fault was found.  Two weeks later 
they conducted a dive consisting of 30 min at 20m and 15 min at 
7m.  1 hour 30 min later they dived to 20m for 56 min.  Towards 
the end of this dive the second-hand computer indicated that 20 
min of stops were required whilst the other diver's computer had 
2 min of no-stop time left.  Again it was assumed that the 
second-hand computer was at fault.  Subsequent to the dive the 
divers consulted diving tables and realised that the second-hand 
computer had been correct and that the other diver's computer 
must have been wrong.  Examination of this computer then 
revealed that it had been set to nitrox 38.  The divers had been 
using air.  It is thought that the setting had been changed by the 
computer being left wet, in a bag, and on a moving boat.  It was 
suggested that the boat's movement may have caused the 
appropriate wet terminals of the computer to have been 
contacted thus resetting it incorrectly. 
November 2005 06/046 
Three divers commenced a night dive in a quarry.  Some time 
into the dive two of the group saw the third diver sinking rapidly 
and they lost contact with him.  They surfaced and raised the 
alarm.  Surface and underwater searches were conducted.  The 
third diver surfaced safely about 25 min later having joined up 
with another pair of divers who were unknown to him.  He 
realised his mistake when he became separated a second time.  
No ill effects were experienced. 
March 2006 06/071 
A diver was on a rebreather training course at a depth of 20m.  
He inhaled water and began to panic.  The instructor gave the 
trainee his alternative air source and they made a rapid ascent to 
the surface.  Their dive duration was 20 min.  Both were placed 
on oxygen.  No subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
April 2006 06/085 
Two divers were engaged in a training course.  They completed 
one dive and 50 min later started another.  They were on a wreck 
at a depth of 15m when the regulator of one of the divers started 
to free flow.  The instructor offered his alternative air source but 
the diver spat it out.  The instructor then offered his main 
regulator; taking the octopus regulator himself.  Again the diver 
refused.  While this was happening they dropped over the side of 
the wreck and sank to 22m.  The instructor brought the diver to 
the surface.  They made a faster than normal ascent.  At the 
surface the diver who had had the free flow fell unconscious.  He 
was recovered from the water and first aid and oxygen was 
given.  The diver recovered.  He was taken by ambulance to 
hospital from where he was discharged later that day. 
June 2006 06/188 
A diver planned a dive to 35m to extend her depth experience.  
She had previously dived to 31m.  During her pre-dive checks 
she found that her pony regulator was leaking air slightly.  She 
agreed with her buddy that she would dive with it switched off 
and that the buddy would turn it on again if it was required.  At 
the bottom, they found themselves in a current and the diver 
became concerned that she could not keep up with the dive 
leader.  Her breathing rate increased.  She managed to calm 
herself down but was concerned that if she did need her pony 
cylinder she could not turn it on on her own.  The dive leader 
stopped and came back to her and they exchanged 'OK' signals.  
The dive leader signalled that she wanted an air check.  The 
troubled diver was unable to find her gauge, which had become 
unclipped.  The dive leader thought that they were both suffering 
the effects of narcosis and signalled that they should ascend.  
The dive leader took hold of the troubled diver and used a 
controlled buoyant lift to help her up to 20m.  At this depth the 
troubled diver found her contents gauge and realised that she 
had enough air to complete the dive; this allowed her to become 
more calm.  The dive leader deployed a delayed SMB and they 
made a normal ascent including safety stops.  Their dive 
duration was 38 min.  No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
June 2006 06/249 
Three divers dived on a wreck at a depth of 13m.  Towards the 
end of the dive one of the three deployed a delayed SMB and 
they drifted off the wreck.  The diver with the reel then lost 
control of his buoyancy and rose to 7m before he was able to 
regain control.  He remained at that depth and completed 
decompression stops before surfacing.  One of the other divers 
attempted to stop his ascent but was unable to do so.  The other 
divers remained on the bottom, deployed another delayed SMB 
and then made a normal ascent.  No subsequent ill effects were 
experienced. 
July 2006 06/164 
A diver was testing a rebreather in a swimming pool after a 
mouthpiece replacement.  Within 2 min underwater his breathing 
became laboured.  He switched to open circuit and then back to 
closed circuit.  He conducted a diluent flush.  All seemed correct 
but then he became breathless again within 1 min.  He switched 
to open circuit and swam into the deep end of the pool.  He 
switched back to closed loop again and very quickly went back to 
the same problem.  He stated that he felt as if he was "breathing 
through a straw".  He switched back to open circuit and left the 
pool.  Shortly afterwards he developed a bad headache.  He 
subsequently discovered that the scrubber cartridge was empty.  
He had forgotten to re-fill it again after its last use. 
August 2006 06/185 
A pair of divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 
46m.  They used twin 12l cylinders containing nitrox 26 and 
carried nitrox 70 for their decompression.  The sea state was 
rough and underwater visibility was low.  They descended a 
shotline to the wreck.  The lead diver attempted to turn on his 
main torch at 25m but it had failed.  He used a back up torch and 
the other diver took the lead.  They swam above the seabed at a 
depth of 45m towards the bows of the wreck.  Visibility was about 
3m but the light level was very low, with only items in the torch 
beams visible.  They swam down the side of the wreck, about 2 
to 3m away from it.  11 min into the dive they realised that the 
side of the wreck could no longer be seen.  They assumed that 
they had swum away from the wreck and they turned towards it 
and swam on.  What they did not realise at the time was that 

NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2006                          
©BSAC - 2006   37 
they had been swimming past a very large hole in the wreck and 
had turned and were now swimming into the wreck itself.  They 
found a wall and followed it.  13 min into the dive they came to a 
junction with two other walls, and found themselves trapped in 
an enclosed space, unable to ascend or back out.  The divers 
became panicked.  One of them accidentally kicked and 
dislodged the mask of the other and they became separated.   
One of the pair saw a hatchway below him and swam down.  He 
found the seabed and moved forwards until he could see clear 
water above him.   He waited outside the 
 
 
wreck for his buddy.  When his buddy did not appear he 
deployed a delayed SMB and tied it off on the wreck.  He then 
tied another reel to the wreck and made his way back inside to 
see if he could find his buddy.  After a while he realised that he 
was not going to find him and made his way back out.  He then 
made his way to the surface completing 24 min of stops on the 
way.  His total dive time was 66 min.  The other diver took longer 
to escape from the wreck and he surfaced missing 14 min of 
stops; he was placed on oxygen.  The emergency services were 
alerted and the diver who had missed stops was given 
precautionary recompression treatment.

An instructor and two trainees conducted a dive to a maximum 
depth of 20m.  Towards the end of the dive the instructor 
demonstrated how to inflate a delayed SMB using his octopus 
regulator.  The regulator started to free flow.  The instructor 
made a controlled ascent to the surface with the trainees. 
February 2006 06/061 
Two divers were engaged in a nitrox training course.  They 
completed a 32 min dive to a maximum depth of 14m with 
practice decompression stops; 5 min at 9m and 5 min at 6m.  
54 min later they dived to a maximum depth of 14m.  During this 
dive the alternative air source regulator of one of the pair 
started to free flow when he used it to inflate a delayed SMB 
mid-water.  The other diver gave him his alternative air source 
and turned the free flowing cylinder off then on again.  The free 
flow continued.  The diver with the free flow switched to his own 
pony regulator and they completed the dive as planned 
including practice stops as before.  The water temperature was 
4.5 deg C. 
February 2006 06/062 
Two divers were engaged in a training course.  15 min into their 
dive, at a depth of 12m one of the pair experienced a free flow 
of his octopus regulator whilst using it to inflate a delayed SMB.  
The other diver gave him his alternative air source and then 
turned the free flowing cylinder off then on again.  The free flow 
stopped.  The diver reverted to his own main regulator and the 
dive continued without further incident. 
February 2006 06/060 
Three divers were at a depth of 10m engaged in a training 
exercise.  One of the three used his octopus regulator to inflate 
his delayed SMB; this regulator began to free flow.  One of the 
other divers gave him his alternative air source and the third 
diver turned the free flowing cylinder off.  The diver with the free 
flow then switched to his own pony regulator.  The divers then 
ascended.  At the surface the cylinder was turned back on to 
allow the diver to inflate his BCD.  The regulator free flowed 
again so the cylinder was switched off as soon as the BCD was 
inflated.  All divers left the water safely.  Their dive duration was 
25 min. 
March 2006 06/070 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 19m.  At 
18m the regulator of one of the divers started to free flow.  He 
was using twin cylinders with two regulators.  He was unable to 
reach the isolation valve.  He surfaced breathing from the free 
flowing regulator.  He was placed on oxygen for 30 min.  No 
subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
March 2006 06/167 
A trainee and an instructor entered the water to participate in a 
training dive using a lifting bag.  They descended to a maximum 
depth of 22m.  At 20m the instructor attached the lifting bag to a 
shot weight and demonstrated how to fill it with his octopus 
regulator.  He deflated the bag and the trainee filled it with her 
octopus regulator.  The trainee's regulator began to free flow.  
The trainee took the instructor's alternative air source and the 
instructor turned the cylinder off.  When he turned it back on 
again the regulator continued to free flow.  He turned the 
cylinder off again and they made an ascent to the surface with 
the trainee using the instructor's alternative air source.  They 
made a safe ascent including a short safety stop. 
April 2006 06/238 
Two divers descended a shotline to the seabed at a depth of 
15m.  At this point one of the pair pressed the button of his 
drysuit inflation valve.  The valve fell out in his hand.  The diver 
disconnected the feed hose and they aborted the dive.  The 
drysuit was brand new and a circlip was found to have come off. 
April 2006 06/268 
Two pairs of divers entered the water to dive together to a 
maximum depth of 36m.  As they approached their target depth 
the regulator of one of the divers began to free flow.  His buddy 
gave him his pony regulator.  The diver with the free flow began 
to suffer from a mask flooding problem.  The four divers began 
their ascent.  At 15m the free flow stopped but the diver 
continued to experience mask flooding.  His buddy gave him his 
octopus regulator but he was unable to clear it.  After two 
attempts he cleared the regulator.  At 10m he switched back to 
his main regulator and they made a normal ascent with two 
safety stops.  Once out of the water the diver was treated for 
shock. 
April 2006 06/099 
Two divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 
34m.  They explored the wreck for a while then one of the 
divers indicated to the other that he had lost his weightbelt.  
They were unable to find the missing weightbelt in the poor 
conditions on the wreck.  The other diver deployed a delayed 
SMB and then dumped air from his BCD and drysuit.  The diver 
without the weightbelt held on to him and they started to wind 
themselves up the SMB line.  They made a 2 min stop at 15m 
and a 2 min stop at 12m.  They dumped further air and made a 
3 min stop at 9m.  The diver without the weightbelt was now 
quite buoyant and pulling upwards on the back of the other 
diver.  They managed to complete a 5 min stop at 6m and a 4 
min stop at 3m by which time both of their computers had 
cleared.  Both were safely recovered from the water and no 
subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
May 2006 06/107 
Three divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 
30m.  They descended a heavily weighted shotline.  During the 
ascent up this shotline the weightbelt of one of the divers fell 
off.  One of the other divers saw this and took hold of the diver 
and the shotline.  The diver did not realise that his weightbelt 
had gone.  They ascended slowly.  At 6m the buoyant diver 
began to rise to the surface despite the efforts of his buddies.  
The buoyant diver's computer showed no decompression 
requirements.  The other two required 2 min at 3m.  They had 
not broken the surface and descended to 3m to conduct their 
stops while keeping watch on the buoyant diver on the shot 
buoy.  All were safely recovered from the water and no 
subsequent ill effects were reported. 
May 2006 06/159 
An instructor and two trainees entered the water and 
descended to a depth of 21m.  They checked and adjusted their 
buoyancy and then set off finning into a current.  One of the 
trainees noticed that it was becoming harder for him to breathe.  
He took his buddy's octopus regulator and signalled that he 
wanted to ascend.  The instructor gave the trainee his 

NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2006                          
©BSAC - 2006   39 
alternative air source and all three ascended safely to the 
surface.  It was found that the regulator had malfunctioned. 
June 2006 06/127 
Two divers commenced a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 
29m.  12 min into the dive one of the pair heard a loud 'crack'.  
His buddy signalled that the diver had a problem with one of his 
hoses and that he was losing air.  The diver looked at his 
contents gauge and saw that this was decreasing rapidly.  They 
started their ascent.  At 15m the diver's air supply was 
exhausted and he took his buddy's octopus regulator.  They 
continued their ascent, making a 5 min safety stop at 4m.  They 
were safely recovered into the boat.  It was subsequently found 
that the diver's octopus hose had split. 
June 2006 06/277 
A diver breathing air used one cylinder of a twin cylinder system 
and had that cylinder refilled.  His next dive was to a depth of 
59m.  While descending the shotline he noticed that the air in 
the refilled cylinder was 'not very nice'.  He switched to the other 
cylinder and the air was normal.  During his ascent from the 
dive he switched back to the refilled cylinder and again noticed 
that the air had a bad taste.  He took the cylinder back to the 
shop where it was refilled; a problem was found with the 
compressor filter and the shop owner paid for the diver to have 
his cylinders cleaned. 
June 2006 06/200 
Two divers were conducting a wreck dive at a maximum depth 
of 19m.  During the dive, the weightbelt of one of the pair fell off.  
His buddy saw this happen and grabbed both diver and 
weightbelt.  He was then able to help the diver to refit the belt.  
The dive continued without further incident. 
June 2006 06/201 
An instructor and two trainees descended a shotline to dive on 
a wreck.  They reached the wreck at 7m, adjusted their 
equipment, and continued down to a depth of 19m.  At this point 
one of the trainees lost her weightbelt and began to make a 
buoyant ascent.  The instructor took hold of the trainee and 
made himself negatively buoyant.  They then made their way 
along the wreck back to the shotline.  They made a controlled 
ascent up the shotline.  The second trainee followed.  The 
divers were safely recovered into their boat.  No subsequent ill 
effects were reported. 
July 2006 06/171 
A diver left two cylinders to be refilled at an air station.  He 
asked for nitrox 28 and labelled the cylinders accordingly.  The 
following day he conducted a gas analysis on both cylinder and 
found that both contained air.  He reported the problem to the 
air station. 
August 2006 06/204 
Two divers entered the water from a boat to conduct a wreck 
dive.  They exchanged 'OK' signals then there was a loud bang 
and mass of bubbles was seen to be escaping from behind one 
of the divers.  The other diver turned off the cylinder from which 
the air was escaping.  He reported that a high pressure hose 
had failed adjacent to the ferrule that attached it to the first 
stage.  Both divers were recovered into the boat.  The failed 
equipment was replaced and the divers completed their dive 
without further incident. 
August 2006 06/225 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 30m.  
Some time into the dive, one of the pair, who was using a 
rebreather, noticed a leak in his neoprene drysuit.  The leak got 
worse and the legs of the drysuit began to fill with water.  The 
divers decided to abort the dive and began to ascend the 
shotline.  The leak was in the neck seal and air was lost from 
the suit.  This made it difficult for the diver to ascend, and the 
condition was made worse by the inertia of the water in the suit.  
At the surface the diver's BCD was fully inflated and he ditched 
his weightbelt to enable him to stay at the surface.  The divers 
were both safely recovered from the water and no subsequent 
ill effects were experienced. 
September 2006 06/233 
A diver on an instructor course entered the water from a 
hardboat using a backward roll entry.  As she did so her 
delayed SMB and reel, which were attached to her via a D ring 
on her BCD, caught on a cleat on the boat.  The D ring was torn 
from her BCD and the SMB and reel remained in the boat; the 
student felt under pressure to continue the dive without this 
equipment.  The student and her instructor descended a 
shotline to a wreck; the underwater visibility was 1 to 2m.  The 
student led the dive and descended to the stern of the wreck.  
As she did so the visibility dropped to 0.5m and when she 
turned around she could no longer see the instructor.  She 
looked around for him and lost sight of the wreck.  Her depth 
was 35m.  She made an ascent to the surface, concerned that 
she had no SMB in an area busy with boats.  The instructor 
deployed a delayed SMB and made his ascent.  The boat 
headed towards the SMB.  The dive manager on the boat 
spotted the unmarked diver directly in the boat's path; he 
advised the skipper and both divers were safely recovered. 
September 2006 06/294 
A diver was about to enter the water when another member of 
the party noticed that her BCD had a fault.  The BCD had a 
fitting for an emergency cylinder and this fitting was found to 
have sheared off; she was not using the emergency cylinder.  A 
similar problem had occurred previously on another BCD and 
was thought to be due to the fitting catching on something as 
the BCD and cylinder were lifted back into the boat.

Overseas Incidents 
 
 
Fatalities 
November 2005 06/018 
Two pairs of divers planned a dive to a maximum depth of 80m 
using rebreathers with trimix 14/50.  At 80m the pairs 
separated.  After about 15 min one pair came back to the 
shotline to start their ascent.  They saw the other pair moving 
back towards the line.  The first pair started their ascent and 
they noted bubbles coming up from below them, indicating that 
the other pair was ascending too.  At their first stop they 
deployed a delayed SMB and drifted under this to complete 
their ascent.  Once at the surface they saw the SMB of the 
other pair.  The other divers did not surface and after a long 
wait the SMB was pulled up.  They found a reel with 50m of line 
but no divers.  An extensive surface search was conducted but 
the divers were not found.  The two divers' bodies were later 
recovered from a depth of 63m. 
February 2006 06/064 
Three divers dived on a wreck in a maximum depth of 50m.  
After 27 min they started their ascent completing the following 
stops; 3 min at 12m, 7 min at 9m, 5 min at 6m and 3 min at 3m.  
After a surface interval of 2 hours 26 min they dived again.  One 
diver entered the water before the others and descended to the 
shotline to the wreck.  They planned to meet on the wreck.  
They agreed that they would not enter the wreck.  When the 
other two reached the wreck they could not see the third diver.  
They swam around the wreck and found his stage cylinder 
outside an entrance to the engine room.  One of the divers 
looked inside but could not see anyone.  They continued their 
dive and on their return the cylinder was still there.  They looked 
again for the third diver but found nothing.  The divers returned 
to the shotline and one of them ascended while the other 
returned to look for the third diver.  He entered the wreck and 
called out through his mouthpiece.  He heard a reply from the 
third diver.  He realised that the diver was on the lower level of 
the wreck without his reel.  Visibility inside the wreck was poor 
due to disturbed silt.  The searching diver was now low on air 
and made his way to the shotline to make his ascent.  During 
the ascent a cloud of bubbles was seen to rise from the wreck 
and a partially inflated delayed SMB rose up towards them.  
After they surfaced a search was conducted down current but 
nothing was found.  It is thought that the missing diver was 
trapped inside the wreck. 
 
 
 
Decompression Illness 
November 2005 06/026 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 97m using 
trimix 12/52.  He started his ascent after a dive time of 13 min 
and decompressed using nitrox 32 and 50 and then pure 
oxygen.  Once back in the boat he noticed small aches in the 
middle muscles of his arms.  He breathed oxygen for 15 min.  
After about 40 min he noticed visual disturbances.  He was 
placed on oxygen.  He started to vomit.  The emergency 
services were alerted and the boat returned to shore.  He lost 
consciousness on arrival at the shore.  He was taken to a 
recompression facility by ambulance and required resuscitation 
on two occasions during the transfer.  He received 
recompression treatment and a further two sessions a day for 
the next week.  He was left with damage to his sense of 
balance.  Tests showed that he had a PFO;  this had not been 
found during a previous test. 
March 2006 06/093 
A group of divers were briefed for a dive on a reef.  They were 
warned that towards the end of the dive they might encounter a 
current and if they did so a signal would be given.  They would 
then swim against the current for about 50m to go round the 
end of the reef and then they would be collected by their boat.  
The dive progressed and the dive leader signalled one of the 
divers to move nearer to the reef wall.  He mis-understood the 
signal and thought that a strong current was imminent.  He 
finned hard and quickly moved ahead of the group, descending 
as he did so.  The dive leader passed the rest of the group to 
another dive leader and went after the disappearing diver.  At 
27m the diver ran out of air.  The dive leader caught up with him 
and gave him her octopus regulator.  She used a controlled 
buoyant lift to bring him to 10m.  At this point she was unable to 
vent the diver's BCD fully and they rose to the surface without 
completing any stops.  Once back in the boat both were placed 
on oxygen for 30 min.  They went to a recompression facility 
and the dive leader received a series of treatments for a skin 
DCI. 
May 2006 06/102 
A diver conducted a dive to 44m with a 2 min stop at 24m, a 2 
min stop at 14m and a 4 min stop at 5m.  1 hour later she dived 
to 42m for a total time of 29 min including a 2 min stop at 24m, 
a 2 min stop at 13m and a 6 min stop at 5m.  Decompression 
was conducted using nitrox 50.  During the second dive she 
failed to notice her computer's requirement to make a stop at 
14m.  The computer then required her to switch to tables, which 
she did.  30 min after the second dive she noticed a feeling of 
heat and intense itching in her left shoulder.  The feeling spread 
round her right shoulder and down the front of her chest.  At first 
she thought that this was an allergic reaction to her undersuit.  
Soon the itching became an intense pain that ran from under 
her right arm across her chest to her right breast.  The skin 
showed a dark blue mottling and swelling.  She was placed on 
oxygen and taken ashore.  Medical advice was sought and the 
diver went to hospital.  A lymphatic DCI was diagnosed.  She 
was placed on a saline drip.  Her symptoms were resolving and 
she was taken off oxygen.  The following day she was left with a 
slight tenderness in the area that had been affected.  
Dehydration was thought to have been a factor. 
June 2006 06/239 
A diver conducted a 36 min dive to 35m with a 3 min stop at 
6m.  5 hours later he dived to 30m for 31 min with a 3 min 
safety stop at 6m.  During this stop he started to cough.  Back 
on the boat he cough up some blood but the coughing stopped 
after 5 min and he thought no more of it.  The following day he 
dived to 36m.  On ascent he deployed a delayed SMB at 14m 
and continued his ascent.  At 7m he began to experience 
breathing difficulties.  He started a safety stop at 6m but after 2 
min he began to cough uncontrollably.  He signalled to his 
buddy that he was having difficulties and they ascended to the 
surface.  Once back in the boat he continued to cough and 
there was blood in the mucus.  He was placed on oxygen and 
the party returned to the shore.  After an hour the coughing 
stopped.  Advice was sought from a recompression facility.  The 
diver went to a hospital for a chest X-ray and other tests; 
nothing abnormal was found.  The diver had suffered a recent 
accidental blow to his chest.  The subject was advised to refrain 

  NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2006 
42  ©BSAC - 2006 
from diving pending further expert medical opinion. 
July 2006 06/218 
A diver conducted a series of fifteen dives over a six day period.  
No dive was deeper than 29m and safety stops were conducted 
at the end of each dive.  1 hour 30 min after the last dive she 
felt dizzy and had a migraine aura.  30 min later she found a 
slight mottling on both her upper arms.  The symptoms 
resolved.  She had had a severe skin DCI three years earlier 
and had tested negative for a PFO.  As a result of this second 
incident she was tested again and again nothing was found.  
She was advised to dive using nitrox and to take a day's break 
in the middle of future dive series. 
July 2006 06/152 
A diver with symptoms of DCI attended a hospital.  He had a 
sharp pain in his right shoulder, pain in his right elbow and 
muscular weakness of his right hand.  He was transferred to a 
recompression facility for treatment. 
September 2006 06/253 
A diver conducted a dive to a depth of 32m for 40 min with a 3 
min safety stop.  The average depth during this dive was 17m.  
After 2 hours 30 min the diver dived to 31m for 43 min with a 
safety stop at the end.  Again the average depth was 17m.  1 
hour later the diver complained of dizziness.  The diver was 
diagnosed with a vestibular DCI.  She also had signs of a skin 
DCI on her torso.  She was placed on oxygen and airlifted to a 
recompression facility where she was treated. 
 
 
 
Illness / Injury 
October 2005 06/011 
Two divers entered the water after a full briefing.  They 
descended against a wall.  At 3m one of the pair indicated a 
problem with his ears and ascended 1m.  He then descended to 
the seabed in a depth of 6m at which point he experienced a 
pain in his forehead.  They ascended to the surface.  Once back 
in the boat he reported sinus and ear pain.  Medical advice was 
sought and anti-inflammatory drugs and a nasal spray were 
prescribed for ear and sinus barotrauma. 
October 2005 06/186 
Five pairs of divers conducted a night dive from the shore in a 
bay.  After about 40 min four pairs had returned but the fifth pair 
could not be seen in the bay.  The divers on the shore spotted 
the lights of the missing divers outside the bay.  The shore party 
crossed some salt pans to get closer to the fifth pair.  These 
divers were making their way slowly back to the bay in rough 
water.  The shore party suggested that they exit the water 
outside of the bay, across some rocks.  The first diver 
approached the rocks.  The water surged and members of the 
shore party grabbed him, however, two of the shore party were 
swept into the sea.  One of the shore party who was swept in 
was not wearing a diving suit.  As he was recovered from the 
water his legs were scraped across some sharp rocks and his 
shoulder was dislocated.  The other shore party member and 
the other diver were then recovered from the water.  The injured 
person was helped back to the party's vehicles.  The 
emergency services were alerted and the injured person was 
taken to hospital for treatment and released later that night.  
The injured person had suffered a dislocated shoulder on 
previous occasions. 
November 2005 06/029 
Whilst underwater a diver picked up an old bottle that he found 
on the seabed.  The bottle shattered and he received a cut to 
the base of his left thumb.  He made a normal ascent with his 
buddy.  They were recovered into their boat and first aid was 
given.  The diver was taken to hospital and several stitches 
were required.  A tendon had been cut requiring micro-surgery 
to resolve. 
November 2005 06/033 
A trainee diver entered the water with an instructor and started 
a descent.  At about 3m he indicated a problem with his ears.  
They ascended a little and the student was then able to proceed 
down to a maximum depth of 9m.  Upon surfacing he was found 
to have suffered a nose bleed.  Three days later he conducted a 
similar dive.  He experienced no problems during this dive but 
after the dive it was found that he had had a second significant 
nose bleed.  He sought medical advice. 
December 2005 06/048 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 31m.  About 
10 min into the dive, at a depth of about 20m, he began to feel 
anxious and experienced breathing difficulties.  As the dive 
progressed his condition worsened.  After a further 5 min he 
signalled to the rest of the group that he was going to ascend.  
His condition became worse as he ascended.  At the surface he 
gave the emergency signal and got back into a boat.  He was 
placed in the recovery position, on oxygen.  He was transferred 
back to his own boat, still on oxygen.  When the group leader 
returned, about 30 min after the casualty had surfaced, he 
alerted the emergency services.  He was taken by boat to a 
medical centre where he was treated for pulmonary oedema of 
immersion.  He was referred to a cardiologist. 
January 2006 06/092 
A diver conducted a series of two dives per day for four days.  
Prior to the dive trip she had been feeling tired and run down 
but her GP confirmed that she was fit to dive.  On the fifth day 
she dived on a shallow reef.  Towards the end of the dive she 
inadvertently descended to 17m.  She quickly noticed and made 
her way back up to 10m.  She then ascended, making a 3 min 
safety stop at 6m.  Her ascent from 6m was a little fast.  Her 
dive duration was 50 min.  10 min after leaving the water she 
noticed 'pins and needles'.  She was not concerned as she 
often got this feeling in her hands and feet, last thing at night, 
when she was tired.  The symptoms persisted and, once 
ashore, she sought medical advice.  No symptoms of DCI were 
found and she was placed on oxygen for 2 hours.  She was 
given a vitamin B injection and rehydration salts.  The following 
day the symptoms were still present.  A diagnosis of peripheral 
neuritis was made.  She had a final check-up the next day and it 
was confirmed that she was fit to fly home.  On arrival home 
she felt tired and unwell and she took the next week off work.  
Her symptoms worsened.  She felt more tired and nauseous.  
Twelve days after returning she felt 'spaced out' and had a 
tightness across her head.  She contacted a recompression 
facility and received four sessions of recompression treatment.  
It was suggested that she be tested for a PFO prior to diving 
again.  It was suggested that antidepressant medication and 
Sudafed that the diver had taken before the dive together with 
the nicotine patch that she had been wearing may have been 
contributing factors.  Although unclear, the final diagnosis 
excluded DCI. 
March 2006 06/068 
A diver was finning over a wreck in a depth of 17m.  She was 
wearing pool fins.  Her right foot struck part of the wreck and 
she received a cut to her foot.  Medical attention was required.

March 2006 06/069 
A group of divers planned a dive on a wreck to a maximum 
depth of 35m.  One pair started their descent but at 27m one of 
the pair, who was using a rebreather with air as the diluent, 
experienced problems breathing.  He signalled to his buddy 
then deployed a delayed SMB and they started an ascent.  At 
14m he handed the reel to his buddy.  At 9m he switched to his 
baleout system.  At 6m he lost control of his buoyancy and rose 
to the surface.  His buddy followed.  At the surface he was 
distressed and breathless.  He was recovered into his boat.  He 
stated that he thought that he was suffering from carbon dioxide 
poisoning.  He was placed on oxygen.  The emergency services 
were alerted and the other divers were recalled.  The casualty 
was taken ashore and then by ambulance to hospital.  He was 
released later that day.  No fault was found with his rebreather.  
It was suggested that the hoses of his rebreather may have 
been trapped, twisted or collapsed, thus causing an increase in 
breathing resistance. 
April 2006 06/124 
Three divers dived to a depth of 15m.  At this point the dive 
leader saw that the face mask of one of the other divers was 
forced very tightly onto her face causing her eyes and lids to 
bulge.  He indicated to her to equalise the mask but she did not 
do so.  The dive leader brought her to the surface using a 
controlled buoyant lift.  When they reached the surface they 
swam towards the shore.  Once in standing depth they stopped 
and discussed the problem.  The third diver had not surfaced so 
the dive leader returned to find this diver still on the bottom.  
They resurfaced.  All three regrouped and then conducted an 
uneventful dive.  The diver who had had mask squeeze 
suffered from facial bruising and red eyes. 
May 2006 06/106 
Two divers descended an anchor line to a wreck.  The water 
was very calm and as they descended one of the pair released 
her hold on the line and drifted down.  At 20m she encountered 
a current that carried her away from the line and downwards.  
She tried to swim against the current but quickly became out of 
breath.  Her buddy went after her.  They reached a deep part of 
the wreck at 40m and were able to regain control.  Due to her 
struggle to regain control and the rapid descent the diver who 
had been swept away from the line was unable to clear her ears 
and she suffered a ruptured eardrum.  They aborted the dive 
and made a safe ascent to the surface.  Oxygen was given as a 
precaution. 
May 2006 06/288 
A trainee diver conducted a 45 min dive to a maximum depth of 
6m.  2 hours 30 min later he dived again.  He had difficulty 
clearing his ears on the descent.  Once back on the boat blood 
was found in his mask.  30 min later he complained of problems 
with his ear.  It was later found that he had suffered a perforated 
eardrum. 
June 2006 06/198 
A diver conducted a series of dives from a 'live-aboard' dive 
boat.  She then flew home.  On arrival home she was lethargic 
and dizzy.  She sought medical advice and was referred to an 
'Ear, Nose and Throat' department at hospital.  No problems 
were found but she was given two sessions of precautionary 
recompression treatment. 
August 2006 06/207 
A diver had just completed a 48 min dive to 30m with a 5 min 
stop at 6m.  At the end of the dive she climbed a ladder back 
into the boat.  Someone removed one of her fins.  At this point 
the skipper moved the boat and the diver lost her balance and 
fell backwards.  She fell onto a metal water tank and injured her 
right arm in the triceps region.  She suffered bruising and skin 
discolouration and was in pain for the next 24 hours.  She 
continued to dive. 
August 2006 06/289 
A group of six divers entered the water from a boat.  A surface 
marker buoy was thrown from the boat towards the group and a 
gust of wind caught it and carried it into them.  One of the divers 
was struck by the reel.  Someone from the boat entered the 
water and helped the injured diver.  All the divers were 
recovered into the boat.  The injured diver had a 5cm cut above 
his right eye.  He was given first aid treatment.  Once ashore he 
attended hospital where the injury was treated with three 
stitches. 
September 2006 06/242 
A group of eight divers conducted a dive to a planned depth of 
30m.  During the dive two of the group decided to go down to 
50m.  At this depth one of the pair started to behave irrationally, 
digging in the sand and tapping her head.  Her buddy took hold 
of her and brought her up.  At 40m she started to improve.  She 
then started to panic and her buddy had a problem controlling 
the ascent.  At the surface they were recovered into a boat and 
brought ashore.  Their dive duration was 20m and they had 
missed decompression stops.  The distressed diver was placed 
on oxygen.  The emergency services were alerted and she was 
taken to hospital where she remained for two days.  Her 
problem was a result of nitrogen narcosis.  No subsequent ill 
effects were experienced. 
September 2006 06/290 
A group of divers were getting out of a boat.  As one of the 
divers stepped out of the boat into shallow water a large wave 
lifted the boat.  The boat caught the bottom of the diver's 
cylinder and lifted it up causing the pillar valve to strike the back 
of the diver's head.  He took his cylinder off and was assisted 
out of the water.  He was treated for a minor cut to his head.  
No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
September 2006 06/292 
An instructor working with two trainees on controlled buoyant lift 
skills made two ascents from 5m.  He then dived to 18m for a 
total dive time of 42 min.  1 hour 30 min later he dived again to 
18m for 39 min.  4 hours after this dive he noticed a stiffening 
and pain in his right shoulder.  He thought that the cause was a 
muscular strain and took pain killers.  2 hours later the pain 
continued and the diver was placed on oxygen and medical 
advice was sought.  He attended a recompression facility and 
received treatment.  The pain did not resolve and it was 
concluded that it was not DCI.  He was given further pain killers. 
 
 
 
Boating and Surface 
October 2005 06/015 
One fuel tank of a petrol engined RHIB was filled with diesel 
fuel in error.  The engine cut out when the fuel tanks were 
changed over.  Others recovered the boat and divers safely to 
the shore. 
January 2006 06/054 
A dive boat arrived at a wreck site and commenced trying to 
locate the wreck.  A dive guide entered the water and was 
towed backwards and forwards to find the site.  Another boat 
eventually located the site.  The guide then made two dives to 

  NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2006 
44  ©BSAC - 2006 
30m to secure a bow line and a stern line to the wreck.  The 
divers made their first dive down the stern line and returned the 
same way.  They dived to a maximum depth of 30m for 43 min 
with a 5 min stop at 6m.  1 hour 30 min later they dived down 
the bow line.  On arrival at the wreck they noticed that the bow 
line was being cut by abrasion against the side of the wreck.  
On returning to the bow line to ascend they found that it was not 
there.  They moved against a current to the stern line.  Two 
pairs ascended the line.  One pair completed their stops but 
one of the divers stayed with the second pair in case they 
needed additional air for their stops.  With about 2 min 
decompression left the line went slack and started falling down 
towards them.  They started towards the surface.  As they 
approached the surface they saw a boat coming towards them.  
One of the three swam down and to one side.  The second 
diver was struck by the boat and pushed under the bow.  The 
third dive took hold of her and fended them off of the boat.  
They were recovered into their boat without further incident. 
September 2006 06/293 
A dive boat was in transit between dive sites in rough sea 
conditions.  Two divers were on deck when a large wave swept 
one of them overboard.  She was able to swim back to the boat 
and was assisted back onboard. 
September 2006 06/295 
A group of divers were diving from a boat that was secured to a 
wreck.  At the end of the dive they were carrying out safety 
stops on a line secured to the stern of the boat.  When they had 
finished their stops they swam at a depth of 3m to one of two 
ladders which were secured to the stern platform of the boat.  
One diver was on the ladder and two others were swimming 
towards it when the captain started the engine and put the boat 
in gear.  The prop wash knocked the diver off the ladder and 
carried the other two violently away from the boat and 
underneath another boat about 30m away.  The divers were 
recovered by tenders to the dive boat.  They later learned that 
the bow line had parted and the captain had manoeuvred his 
boat to avoid a possible collision with the other boat.  No 
injuries were reported. 
 
 
 
Ascents 
January 2006 06/049 
Two divers entered the water to conduct a shore dive.  They 
dived to a maximum depth of 21m.  After 20 min they started 
their ascent.  At 8m one of the divers, who was using a drysuit, 
lost control of his buoyancy and made a rapid ascent to the 
surface; his buddy surfaced normally.  He was placed on 
oxygen for 20 min and given water to drink.  Medical advice was 
sought.  The casualty was monitored for symptoms of DCI; 
none were found and no further action was taken. 
 
 
 
Technique 
October 2005 06/024 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 27m.  One 
of the pair was using nitrox 35, the other was using air.  Both 
had computers and they agreed to follow the air diver's 
computer and limit their decompression to a maximum of 10 
min.  During the dive the nitrox diver checked the air diver's 
computer, but it was quite small and he did not understand it.  
They started their ascent after 39 min and ascended to 6m and 
made a 5 min stop.  The nitrox diver had had no decompression 
requirement, he signalled to the air diver asking if they could 
ascend and the air diver indicated that they could.  They 
completed the dive.  Unknown to others at the time, the air 
diver's computer had registered missed stops and moved into 
error mode.  When they planned their second dive the air diver 
said that his computer had no planning mode and the tables 
would not allow a sensible second dive.  They therefore 
planned to make the second dive using the air diver's computer 
and limit decompression to a maximum of 10 min.  After a 
surface interval of 1 hour 48 min they dived to 28m.  After about 
30 min the nitrox diver thought that they should be approaching 
the need for a 10 min stop on the air diver's computer and he 
looked at it.  It made no sense to him.  They swam on and the 
diver realised that he had been trying to read it up-side-down.  
He read it again and realised that it was in an error state.  He 
asked the air diver if this was 'OK' and got a 'problem' signal.  
They ascended the boat's anchor line making a 2 min stop at 
9m and a 10 min stop at 6m.  The nitrox diver was now at 50 
bar and they ascended to the surface.  Afterwards the air diver 
stated that his computer had been in an error state after the first 
dive.  He was placed on oxygen for 45 min and monitored for 
DCI.  No symptoms were seen and no further action was taken. 
July 2006 06/240 
Two divers swam in a cross current, following a guide rope, at a 
depth of 14m.  During the swim the two became separated and 
surfaced separately.  Their dive duration was 35 min.  No 
subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
September 2006 06/243 
Two divers descended an anchor line to a wreck in a maximum 
depth of 20m.  As planned, they swam along the wreck to an 
entry point.  Underwater visibility was poor.  One diver entered 
the wreck but shortly afterwards lost contact with her buddy.  
She looked around for him and then made a normal ascent.  
Her buddy surfaced some time later having looked for her for 2 
min and then completing a 3 min safety stop. 
September 2006 06/291 
An instructor and a trainee descended a shotline.  The trainee 
had problems clearing her ears and the descent was halted for 
30 seconds.  They reached a depth of 19m.  After 15 min the 
trainee felt her weightbelt slipping down and she became very 
agitated.  The instructor decided to abort the dive and used a 
controlled buoyant lift to bring them both to the surface.  The 
ascent took over 1 min and the instructor's computer did not 
show any missed stops.  However the computer did show that 
part of the ascent had been rapid.  Both instructor and trainee 
were placed on oxygen and given water.  The boat returned to 
shore and the divers went to hospital for a check up.  No 
symptoms were found.  The trainee's outer ear was found to 
show bruising and she was advised to refrain from diving for 
one week. 
 
 
 
Equipment 
April 2006 06/194 
Two divers conducted a night wreck dive to a maximum depth 
of 9m.  16 min into the dive, one of the pair turned his pressure 
gauge around to check his air.  The gauge blew off the end of 
the hose, and out of the rubber housing.  The diver's buddy 
heard the noise and passed him his alternative air source.  The 
divers surfaced, signalled 'OK' to their cover boat and swam to 
the shore.  No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
April 2006 06/195

Two divers entered the water for a night dive, and started their 
descent down the chain of a buoy.  One of the pair noticed 
water entering his mask but felt that he could solve the problem.  
The problem continued and he stopped just short of the bottom 
to try to resolve the problem.  He unclipped his torch to use this 
to attract his buddy's attention.  He dropped the torch, but was 
able to recover it.  Once on the bottom his buddy tried to assist 
him, but could see no problem with the mask.  The troubled 
diver felt as if he was spinning round and became concerned 
that he might pass out.  He grabbed hold of his buddy.  The 
buddy assisted him to the surface.  They were recovered into 
their boat.  The diver had ingested some water and was sick in 
the boat and again once back on shore.  He was monitored for 
subsequent problems but none occurred.  It was later found that 
the seal around the lens of the mask was faulty. 
August 2006 06/241 
A pair of divers dived on a wreck to a maximum depth of 35m.  
One diver was using nitrox 30 and the other was using air.  
They planned to ascend slowly up the wreck structure, never 
incurring more than 10 min decompression on their computers.  
20 min  into  the dive,  at a depth of 28m,  they discovered  that  
 
 
 
one of their dive computers  was flashing and not giving 
decompression information.  They decided to abort the dive and 
spent 5 min trying to find the shotline.  They were unable to do 
so and they deployed a delayed SMB and started their ascent.  
At 6m the failed computer appeared to be working again and it 
indicated no decompression requirements.  They conducted a 3 
min safety stop and left the water without incident.  After the 
dive it was found that the computer had been incorrectly set for 
use with nitrox 48 for that dive and the preceding 29 dives. 
 
 
 
Miscellaneous 
July 2006 06/449 
A number of live-aboard dive boats were moored up together.  
During the night divers from one of the boats poured hot chilli 
sauce into a number of divers' regulators on one of the other 
boats.  The sauce was found the following morning prior to any 
diving and attempts were made to clean it out.  Some of the 
regulators subsequently required new mouthpieces.  The divers 
expressed concerns about the effects that this would have had 
if the sauce were to have been inhaled at depth.
