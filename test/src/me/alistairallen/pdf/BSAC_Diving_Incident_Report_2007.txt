Introduction 
 
This booklet contains the 2007 Diving Incidents Report, produced by The British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC) in the 
interest of promoting diving safety.  It is important to note that it contains details of UK sports diving incidents 
occurring to divers of all affiliations, plus incidents occurring worldwide involving BSAC members.  
 
Report Format 
The majority of statistical information contained within this report is also shown in graphical form.  Please note that all 
statistical information is produced from UK data only and does not include Overseas Incidents unless noted as ‘All 
Incidents’. 
 
The contents of this report are split into an overview of the year, and then the details of nine incident categories plus some 
historical analyses.  The various sections can be found as shown below:- 
 
 i) Overview Page  1 
 ii) Fatalities Page 5 
 iii) Decompression Incidents Page  7 
 iv) Injury / illness Page  15 
 v) Boating & Surface Incidents Page  21 
 vi) Ascent Problems Page  26 
 vii) Technique Problems Page  34 
 viii) Equipment Problems Page  35 
 ix) Miscellaneous Incidents Page  36 
 x) Overseas Incidents Page  37 
 xi) Numerical & Statistical Analyses Page  40 
 xii) List of Abbreviations Page  42 
 
 
Within each category the incidents are listed in the order of their occurrence, not necessarily that of Incident Reference.  
They are laid out in the following form: 
 
  MONTH/YEAR OF INCIDENT  INCIDENT REF.    
  Brief Narrative of Incident.................................................................................... 
  ........................................................................................................ 
 
The nature of many diving incidents is such that there is usually more than one cause or effect.  Where this is the case the 
incident has been classified under the more appropriate cause or effect. For instance an incident involving a fast ascent, 
causing decompression illness, will be classified under 'Decompression Incidents'.

Overview 
 
has seen a further drop back in the number of 
incidents reported in the UK to a total of 349.  
The chart below shows the total of UK incidents 
reported annually over the last 17 years and it can be seen that 
after a doubling during the 90s, there was a levelling out from 
2000 onwards to a total of 400 incidents per year.  It is unclear if 
the fall this year is marking the beginning of a new trend, if it is 
just part of a normal fluctuation (the last five years are similar in 
size and pattern to the previous five years), or was it an impact 
of the rather poor weather conditions experienced in the 
summer of 2007.  Future years will provide the answer.

The distribution of reported incidents is shown in the following 
chart and it conforms with the expected pattern. 
As can be seen, 68% of these incidents have occurred in the 
summer period.  This is totally consistent with previous years, 
reflecting the increased number of dives that take place during 
the better weather.

Incidents by category 
The incident database categorises all incidents into one of nine 
major categories, and the following chart shows the distribution 
of the 2007 incidents into those categories.  
The highest number of incidents (91) relate to ‘Ascents' and this 
represents a major change. 
In previous year incidents of Decompression Illness (DCI) have 
always been the biggest category but the last five years have 
seen a continued fall in the number of these incidents.  
Conversely the number of Ascent related incidents has risen 
dramatically over the last ten years; there have been a number 
of minor pertubations and this year’s total is slightly down over 
last year but, overall, the trend has been one of a strong 
increase.  This trend has been highlighted in past reports and 
this year the number of Ascent related incidents overtook 
incidents of DCI and became the most numerous category.   
Typically these incidents involve a rapid ascent, often with 
missed decompression stops.  However, if such an ascent were 
to have resulted in a DCI then it would have been recorded in 
the more serious ‘DCI’ category. 
 
More detail on DCI, Ascent and Boat / Surface incidents can be 
found later in this overview together with an analysis of the most 
serious category;  Fatalities.

The pattern of depths in the 0m to 50m range is very similar to 
that normally seen and reflects the amount of diving that takes 
place in these depth ranges.   
The number of incidents reported in the greater than 50m range 
is 9, which is in line with previous years.  One of these incidents 
was a fatality. 
  
The BSAC advises that no air dive should be deeper than 50m, 
and that dives to 50m should only be conducted by divers who 
are appropriately trained and qualified.   
The recommended limit for divers trained to Sports Diver 
standard is 35m and then only when they have received 
appropriate training for diving at this depth. 
The BSAC recommends that mixed gas diving should be to a 
maximum depth of 80m and then only when the diver holds a 
recognized qualification to conduct such dives.  
See the BSAC website for more details of these and other 
diving depth limit recommendations.  
 
The next chart shows the depths at which incidents started.

Inevitably the data are biased towards the shallower depths 
since many incidents happen during the ascent or at the 
surface.  Critical among these are the DCI cases where almost 
always the casualty is out of the water before any problems are 
noted.  This partially explains the large occurrence of ‘Surface’ 
cases as this includes divers with DCI who have left the water. 
Other surface incidents involve boats and boating incidents. 
 
 
Diver qualifications 
The next two charts show the qualification of those BSAC 
members who were involved in reported incidents.

Divers’ use of the Emergency Services 
Divers’ use of the emergency services shows a monthly 
distribution aligned to the distribution of all incidents, and is 
clearly correlated with the number of dives that are taking place. 
 
Last year saw a dramatic drop in our demands upon the 
Coastguard service, but this year the numbers have risen again 
to a total of 204 incidents reported with a Coastguard 
involvement.  This number is in line with the average over the 
last ten years.   
 
This year the Coastguard have changed the way that they 
provide data to us and, as a result, we are getting more 
information on each event.  The benefits are twofold.   
Firstly, it enables us to derive more information about the actual 
nature of an incident and what can be learned from it.   
Secondly, it is easier to identify and link these reports with 
reports from other sources and thus build a more accurate 
picture of an incident and avoid duplication.   
We are very grateful to the MCA for this information.

There were 92 incidents reported that involve the RNLI and this 
continues the trend highlighted last year of a slow reduction in 
divers’ calls on the lifeboat service. 
The following chart shows the distribution of the RNLI related 
incidents throughout this incident year.  It is in line with the

Incidents involving Lifeboats: 92
 
In 2007 95 incidents involved the use of helicopters.  This 
number follows the trend of the last three years of a steady 
reduction from the high of 137 recorded in 2005.   
Helicopters are often tasked to support searches for missing 
divers and to transport divers with DCI to recompression 
facilities.

Fatalities 
12 fatal incidents occurred in the UK during the 2007 incident 
year.  This is significantly below the average of 17.7 fatalities 
per year over the previous ten years.  However, comparisons of 
this nature need to be made with caution since a small change 
can make a big apparent difference to the comparison.   
Although it is clearly good that this number is way below the 
average of recent years it hides the sad fact that 7 of these 
people were BSAC members.  The ten year average for BSAC 
fatalities in the UK is 6.0 fatalities per year and thus, from a 
member’s perspective, the year has, unfortunately, been about 
average.   
 
The factors associated with these fatalities can be summarised 
as follows:- 
• Two cases involved divers who suffered heart attacks.  One 
of these cases involved a 79 year old man who was snorkel 
diving.   
There are two other cases where it seems very likely that 
an acute medical problem was the root cause, but there is 
currently no hard evidence to prove this.  
• Four cases involved divers using rebreathers and while the 
role of the rebreather in the incident is not clear; problems 
with, or misuse of, the system can not be ruled out. 
• Two cases involved divers who became trapped inside 
wrecks and ran out of air.  One of these cases was a double 
fatality.  
• Two cases involved three people diving together and in 
both these cases an underwater separation occurred.  In 
both cases there is a lack of full information but it is very 
probable that the separation was a contributory factor to the 
outcome.   
• One case involved solo diving.   
• One case involved a dive to a depth greater than 50m.  This 
was a diver who dived to 75m (using a rebreather) and 
surfaced, missing all decompression stops.  
 
Often multiple causes were involved in an incident and in five of 
the fatal incidents there is insufficient information available to be 
clear about the exact chain of events and root causes. 
 
Finally there were three reported fatality overseas.   
Two of these involved the deaths of BSAC members.  Both of 
these cases involved separation underwater; in one case there 
had been three divers together.   
In the third case a BSAC member reported on the death of a 
non-BSAC member where the casualty had dived, using a 
rebreather with trimix, to a depth of 76m. 
 
 
 
Decompression incidents 
The BSAC database contains 81 reports of DCI incidents in the 
2007 incident year, some of which involved more than one 
casualty.  When these multiple cases are counted the result is 
89 cases of DCI. 
This number dramatically continues the decline in cases of DCI 
from a peak of 173 individual cases reported in 2002 and 
returns us to below the typical levels reported in the late 90s. 
  
An analysis of the causal factors associated with the cases for 
2007 indicates the following major features:- 
24 involved diving to deeper than 30m 
24 involved rapid ascents 
28 involved repeat diving  
13 involved missed decompression stops  
Some cases involved more than one of these causes. 
 
Whilst cases of DCI may have declined, cases of abnormal 
ascent (rapid ascent and/or missed stops) have significantly 
increased (as summarised below), and it is just good fortune 
that these abnormal ascents did not resulted in DCI. 
 
Some of the ‘Injury and Illness’ incidents are also thought to be 
DCI related, but they are reported by the RNLI as ‘Diver illness’ 
and the cause of the illness is not defined. 
The number of incidents in this category in 2007 is at a level 
similar to the average of recent years.   
 
 
 
Ascent related incidents 
In previous years I have highlighted the rise in the number of 
incidents associated with abnormal ascents.  This year’s report 
contains 91 ascent related incidents and, while this number is 
slightly down on last year’s peak of 99, it must be taken in 
context of a lower total number of reported incidents.  This 
category of incidents is now the biggest, having suffered a 
dramatic rise over the last ten years. 
 
As I have stated before, the great majority of these incidents 
relate to poor buoyancy control and rapid ascents, often 
resulting in missed decompression stops. 

 ` NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2007 
4        ©BSAC - 2007 
Better training is the key; BCD and drysuit control, and the use 
of associated equipment, especially delayed SMBs. 
 
These are avoidable problems and instructors should make this 
a priority area for attention. 
 
Many DCI cases have their roots in these problems; they have 
been recorded under the DCI heading but the causal factors are 
often the same, so the actual number of abnormal ascents will 
be significantly higher than shown above.   
 
 
Boating and surface incidents 
'Boating and Surface' incidents are the third largest category.  
 
Recent years have seen a very marked decline in the number of 
these incidents from a maximum of 124 in 1998.  In 2007 there 
were 71 such incidents reported, a little up on last year but still 
consistent with an overall downward trend. 
 
54% of these incidents involved engine problems and 38% 
involved lost divers; this is entirely consistent with previous 
years.   
 
Many of the engine problems could have been prevented by 
better planning (to avoid running out of fuel) and correct 
servicing.   
 
The lost diver category is one that has been the subject of 
much comment in the past.  Good planning, care and attention 
from the cox and dive manager, and effective surface detection 
aids are critical.   
Planning, care and attention will help to prevent the divers from 
becoming lost in the first place, and effective surface detection 
aids will enable the divers to be found rapidly should the first 
part fail. 
This year saw one notable case where divers were safely 
recovered, at nightfall, having been in the water for over 9 
hours. 
 
 
 
 
 
Conclusions 
Key conclusions are:- 
• Reported incidents are down this year.  The reason for this 
is unclear.  Plausible explanations are: a normal 
perturbation in the statistics; less diving during the year due 
to poor weather; improved diver safety; or a combination of 
these factors.  Future years will throw more light on this 
issue. 
• The number of fatalities is significantly below the norm of 
previous years. 
• No new causal factors for fatalities have been identified.  
Continuous skills practice, rigorous buddy checks and 
diving within one’s current ability limits, with a slow 
progression to new areas, are the critical keys to safe 
diving. 
• Incidents associated with abnormal ascents continue to 
show a dramatic rise and attention must be given to training 
in this area and the continuous practice of ascent skills. 
 
As has been stated many times before, most of the incidents 
reported within this document could have been avoided had 
those involved followed a few basic principles of safe diving 
practice.  The BSAC publishes a booklet called 'Safe Diving' 
(latest edition published at the end of 2006). which summarises 
all the key elements of safe diving and is available to all, free of 
charge, from the BSAC website or through BSAC HQ. 
 
Remember you can never have too much practice and the 
further you stay away from the limits of your own personal 
capabilities the more likely you are to continue to enjoy your 
diving. 
 
Please browse through the details in this report and use them to 
learn from others’ mistakes. They have had the courage and 
generosity to record their experiences for publication, the least 
that we can do is to use this information to avoid similar 
problems. 
 
Finally, if you must have an incident please report it on our 
Incident Report form, available free from BSAC HQ or via the 
BSAC website.   
As always, your anonymity is assured – great care is taken to 
preserve the confidentiality of any personal information 
recorded in BSAC Incident Reports.

Fatalities 
 
March 2007 07/026 
An instructor and two trainees were engaged in a trimix training 
course.  The instructor was using a rebreather and the students 
were using open circuit equipment.  They dived to a maximum 
depth of 75m.  The two students started their ascent and the 
instructor remained at depth some time longer.  The two 
students were conducting their first stop when they saw the 
instructor making a rapid ascent up the shotline.  They offered 
him an alternative gas source but he refused this, inflated his 
BCD and rose directly to the surface missing all stops.  The 
emergency services were alerted and the diver was taken to 
hospital where he was declared dead. 
March 2007 07/035 
A diver under training entered the water to make his second 
open water dive.  He and his instructor entered the water and 
dived to a depth of 6m.  Underwater visibility was poor and this 
worsened as the divers stirred up silt on the bottom.  As a result 
of the poor visibility they surfaced.  At the surface the trainee 
was behind the instructor.  The trainee removed his mouthpiece 
and shouted for help.  The instructor turned round and found 
the trainee rolling around on the surface; he then started to sink.  
Another instructor who was nearby swam to help and he dived 
below the surface, took hold of the trainee, inflated his BCD and 
brought him back to the surface.  At this point the trainee was 
breathing but unconscious.  The casualty was towed to the 
shore and quickly recovered from the water.  Once out of the 
water he stopped breathing.  Resuscitation techniques were 
applied and the emergency services were called.  The casualty 
was taken to hospital where he was declared dead.  The post-
mortem results were inconclusive.

A rebreather diver and her buddy commenced a deep dive.  
She became entangled in a shotline as the supporting buoy 
collapsed and she started to sink.  Her buddy followed her down 
to a depth of 40m where he tried to free her but also became 
entangled.  He became disorientated, ran low on gas and had 
to surface.  He was airlifted to a recompression chamber and 
treated for shock and possible DCI.  A search was conducted 
for the missing diver using an ROV and her body was recovered 
five days later.  Press reports of the coroner's inquest state that 
a valve diaphragm in the casualty's regulator was found to be 
ruptured. 
April 2007  07/039 
Two divers entered the water for a shore dive.  One of the pair 
was too buoyant and experienced an octopus regulator free 
flow.  After two attempts they decided to abort the dive.  They 
climbed back over rocks and then sat for a while talking about 
the dive's problems.  After about 15 min they started climbing 
over more rocks to get to the exit point.  Without warning one of 
the divers slumped into a rock pool.  His buddy asked if he was 
alright but got no response.  The buddy called for assistance.  
The emergency services were called and resuscitation 
techniques were applied.  He was taken to hospital where he 
was pronounced dead.  A post-mortem revealed that the 
casualty had three blocked arteries and had suffered a heart 
attack.

May 2007 07/064 
A rebreather diver entered the water ahead of his two buddies 
and dived to place a decompression cylinder on a shotline.  He 
resurfaced and spoke to a fourth diver who was preparing to 
enter the water.  Although they had planned to dive together, 
when the two buddies entered the water the first diver had 
already left the surface again.  They continued their dive and, 
several minutes later, they saw the torchlight of the first diver.  
They found him lying on the bottom at a depth of 50m; he was 
unconscious, his mouthpiece was out of his mouth and he was 
tangled in some branches and other debris.  They freed him 
and sent him to the surface.  They started their ascent and met 
the fourth diver coming down.  The fourth diver returned to the 
surface and found the casualty on his back with his mask off, he 
recovered him to the side, removed him from the water and 
started resuscitation procedures.  10 min later the casualty's 
two buddies surfaced and contacted the emergency services.  
The casualty was taken to hospital where he was declared 
dead.  It is thought that the casualty was diving with a 
rebreather that he had built himself. 
May 2007 07/065 
Two rebreather divers entered the water and commenced their 
dive down a shotline to a wreck.  They conducted a bubble 
check at 6m and exchanged OK signals at 20m.  They reached 
the top of the wreck at 32m.  One of the pair indicated that all 
was not well.  The dive leader signalled that they should ascend 
and they started to do so.  2m into the ascent the troubled diver 
became agitated, closed and removed his rebreather 

  NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2007

mouthpiece and placed his bale out regulator into his mouth.  
He then spat this regulator out and began to panic.  His buddy 
placed the regulator back into his mouth and attempted to purge 
it; he discovered that it was not turned on.  He turned the 
cylinder on and attempted to put the regulator into the diver's 
mouth, but the diver was not able to take the regulator and he 
fell unconscious.  The pair had sunk to the bottom at a depth of 
35m.  The buddy dropped the casualty's weightbelt and inflated 
both their jackets.  They made a buoyant ascent to the surface.  
Their total dive time was 6 min.  At the surface the casualty was 
not breathing.  The buddy called for help and tried to give 
rescue breaths.  This was difficult to do because of their inflated 
BCDs and side mounted gas cylinders,  Their boat reached 
them quickly but they could not get the casualty back into the 
boat.  His rebreather was removed and he was held by the boat.  
The Coastguard was alerted and 5 min later a helicopter 
arrived.  After some difficulty the casualty was airlifted to 
hospital where he died three days later.  The buddy was airlifted 
to a recompression chamber for precautionary treatment.  The 
casualty had had a problem with his rebreather one month 
earlier and had suffered from hypercapnia.  (07/075 relates). 
June 2007 07/073

One pair and one trio of divers conducted a dive on a wreck in a 
maximum depth of 25m.  The pair of divers failed to resurface 
and the Coastguard was alerted when it was clear that they 
were overdue.  A surface search was conducted involving a 
lifeboat, a helicopter and a number of other crafts.  About 1 hour 
15 min later the trio of divers returned to the wreck to search for 
the missing divers; they found nothing.  Divers from two other 
dive boats came to assist and the first missing diver's body was 
located inside the wreck and brought to the surface.  The divers 
waited for the underwater visibility in the wreck to clear and they 
then recovered the second diver's body, also from inside the 
wreck.  It is thought that the lost divers' air supplies were 
exhausted. 
August 2007 07/237 
The Coastguard was alerted when a diver became overdue 
after a wreck dive.  A search was initiated involving a helicopter 
and a lifeboat.  Other divers returned to the wreck and found 
and recovered the missing diver's body.  It seems that he had 
become stuck in a small gap in the wreck and had run out of air. 
August 2007 07/180 
The alarm was raised by people on a beach when a snorkel 
diver was seen to be in trouble.  The snorkel diver was 
recovered to the shore and resuscitation techniques were 
applied.  He was airlifted to hospital where he was declared 
dead.  The casualty was 79 years old and it was suggested that 
he had suffered a heart attack.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2007 07/204 
Two divers entered the water to conduct a drift dive at a 
maximum depth of 25m in a 3 knot current.  At the bottom 
visibility was only about 2m and they deployed a buddy line.  
Their plan was to deploy a delayed SMB as soon as they 
reached the bottom.  One of the divers went to deploy his SMB 
but discovered that the buoy had become detached and was 
missing.  He signalled to the other diver but his signal was not 
understood and the other diver passed him his reel which also 
did not have its SMB attached.  The first diver checked the 
buddy to see if he could locate the SMB but he couldn't.  The 
diver was concerned that if they stayed down too long without 
an SMB they would lose contact with the boat so he signalled 
the ascent.  The buddy returned the OK signal but did not 
ascend.  The diver pulled on the buddy line and signalled again; 
they began to ascend.  The diver leading the ascent noticed 
that the buddy's buoyancy control was not good and that he 
didn't seem to be monitoring his instruments properly.  At the 
start of the ascent they dropped back a number of times, they 
then made a rapid ascent from 15m to the surface.  Their dive 
duration was 17 min.  At the surface the buddy stated that he 
felt sick, he then spat out his regulator and vomited.  He did not 
replace his regulator and began to lose buoyancy.  The other 
diver put air into the distressed diver's BCD and gave an 
emergency signal to the boat.  The distressed diver then 
became unconscious.  The other diver and the boat's skipper 
recovered the unconscious diver into the boat with some 
difficulty.  The emergency services were alerted and divers from 
a nearby dive boat came to assist.  The casualty was given 
oxygen and then resuscitation techniques were applied.  The 
casualty was airlifted to hospital where he died.  The casualty 
had been diving on air and with a pony cylinder containing 
nitrox 50 for decompression; the other diver was using a 
rebreather.

trawled up with a lobster pot.  The divers made a buoyant 
ascent, one diver was placed on oxygen and suffered tingling in 
arms and legs, both divers were airlifted to a recompression 
chamber for treatment, the helicopter was met by Poole 
Coastguard and an ambulance.  (Coastguard report). 
October 2006 07/275 
Rescue helicopter R-169 from RAF Chivenor lifted three divers 
from the Exmouth area for transportation to DDRC in Plymouth.  
(Coastguard report). 
October 2006 07/278 
A dive RHIB contacted Brixham Coastguard reporting having a 
diver aboard suffering from suspected DCI, the diving vessel 
returned to port where the vessel was met by Plymouth 
Coastguard team and West Country ambulance service, for 
transportation to recompression chamber for treatment.  
(Coastguard report). 
December 2006 07/016 
Two divers conducted a 52 min dive to a depth of 20m.  1 hour 
20 min later they dived to 21m for 37 min.  Some time was 
spent at the end of both dives at a depth of 6m.  About 1 hour 
after surfacing from the second dive one of the divers began to 
feel unwell.  He was placed on oxygen .  His condition did not 
improve and diving medical advice was sought.  He was airlifted 
to a recompression facility for treatment. 
December 2006 07/022 
Three divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 45m 
using trimix 18/45.  After a dive duration of 33 min they started 
their ascent.  They planned to make their first stop at 21m, then 
ascend and switch to nitrox 50 for further stops.  However, one 
of the divers surfaced missing these stops; his buddies 
surfaced normally.  The diver who had made the rapid ascent 
was placed on oxygen and given fluids.  Others suggested that 
the Coastguard should be alerted and that he should seek 
medical advice but these proposals were rejected.  In the 
following days the diver developed mild symptoms of DCI.  He 
attended a recompression facility and was recompressed. 
February 2007 07/029 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 50m using 
trimix 19/34.  During her ascent she made the following stops: 1 
min at 31m, 1 min at 27m, 1 min at 24m, 2 min at 18m, 3 min at 
15m, 4 min at 12m, 3 min at 9m, 4 min at 6m, 15 min at 4.5m.   
Some of these latter stops were using nitrox 80.  Her previous 
dive had been two weeks earlier.  At the surface the sea 
conditions had become rough and she had some difficulty 
getting back in the boat.  1 hour later she developed symptoms 
of dizziness and nausea.  1 hour after this she developed a pain 
in her right elbow.  She started to breathe nitrox 80 and the 
Coastguard was alerted.  She was taken by lifeboat to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  She was left with residual 
shoulder and elbow pain.  She reports that she was in the first 
week of her menstrual cycle. 
February 2007 07/032 
A diver was involved in refresher training in a swimming pool.  
She dived to a maximum depth of 4m.  Some time into the dive 
she experienced severe ear pain, she was instructed to clear 
her ears but was unsuccessful.  She came to the surface, still in 
pain, and the lesson was aborted.  The following day she awoke 
with a severe pain in her ears and face.  She saw her doctor 
and was advised to rest.  The pain got worse and she went to 
her local casualty department.  She was diagnosed with a 
pressure related injury and possible mild DCI.  She was sent 
home with pain killers.  She then contacted a recompression 
facility for advice and attended for examination.  She was 
diagnosed with sinus damage and was advised that her 
symptoms would resolve in two days.  Two days later the 
symptoms persisted and the pain was getting worse.  She 
contacted the recompression facility again, DCI was diagnosed 
and she was given a number of recompression treatments 
which resolved her symptoms.

The Coastguard was alerted when a diver with symptoms of 
DCI was making his own way to a recompression facility.  
(Coastguard report). 
March 2007 07/057 
Two pairs of divers entered the water from the shore.  It was 
noticed that the weightbelt of one of the divers did not 'look 
right'; the weightbelt was checked and the decision made to 
continue.  They followed a line to a wreck at a maximum depth 
of 20m.  The diver who had had the weightbelt problem moved 
to an upright position; the clasp of the weighbelt became 
undone and the weightbelt slipped down.  The diver held onto 
the weightbelt and they made their way back along the line.  

  NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2007

The seabed sloped gently upwards.  At 18m the belt came off 
completely and the diver's buddy fixed it around the diver's 
torso.  They made their way back up to 11m at which point the 
belt fell off.  The buoyant diver was in a feet up posture and he 
started to ascend.  His buddy went with him and managed to 
turn him the right way up during the ascent.  They ascended to 
the surface at a rate of 10m per min.  The buoyant diver was 
panicking and his buddy towed him to the shore.  He was 
helped from the water and dekitted.  He was showed no 
symptoms but he was placed on nitrox 28.  The following day 
the buoyant diver engaged in some heavy work and then 
noticed a lump on his wrist which he was able to easily move 
around.  He reported to his local hospital and was placed on 
oxygen.  The lump dissipated.  That night he was taken to a 
recompression facility and the following day received one 
session of recompression therapy.  The day after that the lump 
re-appeared.  DCI was diagnosed. 
March 2007 07/285 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 23m.  During 
the dive he lost his weightbelt and he made a rapid ascent from 
11m.  His dive duration was about 30 min.  He developed a 
headache and a weakness in his left arm.  The following day he 
attended a hospital for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
March 2007 07/157 
A diver conducted a dive using a rebreather to a maximum 
depth of 36m.  During the dive she became separated from her 
buddy but continued solo as previously agreed.  Her dive 
duration was 48 min including a 2 min stop at 14m and a 3 min 
stop at 3m.  She sneezed several times during the dive.  Later 
she felt a little unwell.  This feeling continued and three days 
later she visited her doctor with symptoms of severe lethargy 
and loss of balance.  She was referred to a recompression 
facility where a severe cerebral DCI was diagnosed.  She 
received a series of fourteen recompression treatments which 
fully resolved her symptoms.  She was tested for a PFO and a 
large shunt was found. 
April 2007 07/059 
Two divers conducted a dive to 17m for 25 min with a 1 min 
safety stop at 6m and a 3 min safety stop at 3m.  After a 2 hour 
surface interval they entered the water again, with an instructor, 
to conduct a navigation exercise.  They dived to a maximum 
depth of 17m.  Underwater visibility was low and, at a depth of 
15m, one of the two divers became disorientated and started to 
feel panicky.  She began to float upwards.  The instructor 
signalled the second diver to ascend and then turned back to 
the troubled diver, but by this time she had gone.  He again 
signalled to the second diver to ascend and then made his way 
to the surface to locate the troubled diver; at the surface he saw 
that she was 15m away from him.  He shouted at her to keep 
her mouthpiece in and to inflate her BCD.  He swam to her and 
checked that her BCD was inflated.  He started to tow her to the 
shore.  The second diver surfaced and assisted.  They helped 
her from the water and de-kitted her.  During her drive home the 
troubled diver noticed a pain in her knee.  She spoke to the 
other divers by phone; they sought medical advice and 
arranged to meet up with her.  They took her to hospital where 
she was given morphine and oxygen.  She was then taken to a 
recompression chamber and given two sessions of 
recompression treatment.  It was suggested that narcosis may 
have been involved. 
April 2007 07/060 
A trainee diver completed five dives over a weekend.  On the 
first day he made three dives to depths between 4 and 15m.  
On the second day he dived twice to a maximum depth of 8m.  
He awoke during the night with a headache and shoulder pain.  
He took painkillers which resolved the shoulder pain but not the 
headache.  The following morning he attended a recompression 
facility for examination.  He received recompression treatment.  
The following day the shoulder pain had resolved and he was 
given a further session of recompression therapy.  It was not 
certain if he had suffered DCI or a muscular strain. 
April 2007 07/183 
An instructor and two trainees entered the water to conduct 
basic drills, they then conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 
6m.  Their dive duration was 36 min.  Later that day they dived 
to conduct further drills in a maximum depth of 8m.  The 
instructor demonstrated alternative air sharing with both 
students in turn between 6 and 3m.  Both students then 
practiced the drill themselves from 6 to 3m and then from 6m to 
the surface.  The same process was then repeated for a 
controlled buoyant lift drill.  Their dive duration was 39 min.  At 
the surface the two students both completed a 20m rescue tow.  
The group then made a surface swim to the exit point.  The 
following day they descended a shotline to a depth of 8m.  They 
then swam to a depth of 10m where they practiced buoyancy 
control drills.  They then swam back to a depth of 8m for a few 
minutes and then to 6m where they made a 1 min safety stop.  
They then surfaced and got back into a boat.  Later that day 
one of the trainees complained of a pain in his right elbow, he 
was given water to drink.  He then developed a tingling 
sensation and pain down the outside of his right arm.  He was 
placed on oxygen.  His symptoms included a mild light 
headedness and elbow pain.  He was taken to a recompression 
facility for treatment. 
May 2007 07/104 
Two divers conducted a dive to a wreck at a maximum depth of 
34m.  Towards the end of the dive they swam away from the 
wreck and deployed a delayed SMB.  The dive leader signalled 
the ascent and started to reel in the buoy line.  At about 16m 
the dive leader realised that water was leaking into his mask.  
He tried blowing out through his nose to clear it but he was 
unable to get rid of the water.  His attempts to clear the mask 
increased the flooding.  He was breathing heavily and became 
buoyant, rising above his buddy.  He raised his cuff dump but 
made a rapid ascent to the surface.  At the surface he looked 
for his buddy but could not see him.  He dumped the SMB reel 
and inflated his BCD.  He gave an emergency signal to the boat 
and then lost consciousness.  His dive duration was 16 min.  
His buddy surfaced shortly afterwards, took hold of the casualty 
and brought him to the boat.  Others in the boat helped to 
remove his kit and lift him out of the water.  By this time he was 
turning blue and foaming at the mouth.  Resuscitation 
techniques were applied and he made a quick recovery.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and the casualty was placed on 
oxygen.  The casualty was transferred to a lifeboat and airlifted 
to hospital.  The lifeboat returned for the buddy who was taken 
to a recompression facility for treatment for DCI. 
May 2007 07/083 
The Coastguard was alerted when a diver developed symptoms 
of DCI. The diver was airlifted to a recompression facility for 
treatment.  Lifeboats also attended. 
May 2007 07/108 
A diver conducted a 36 min dive to a depth of 46m with a 4 min 
stop at 6m and a 2 min stop at 3m.  2 hours 35 min later he 
dived to 45m for 28 min with a 7 min stop at 6m and a 3 min 
stop at 3m.  During the 6m stop he felt some pain in his right 
shoulder and elbow.  During the boat trip back to the shore the 
pain worsened.  Once ashore he experienced a feeling of heat 
and itching across his chest.  There was bruising and a rash on 
his chest.  He was placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was

©BSAC - 2007  9 
alerted.  He was taken by helicopter and ambulance to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  He made a full recovery.  
He planned to take a PFO test. 
May 2007 07/147 
Two divers dived to a maximum depth of 16m for 31 min.  They 
used a delayed SMB for their ascent and planned a 3 min 
safety stop at 6m.  A heavy swell made it difficult for them to 
hold the 6m depth and they rose and fell between 3m and 8m.  
One of the divers felt quite cold.  Two hours later this diver 
developed a stiffness in her right upper arm and a tingling in her 
fingers.  One hour later she also developed tingling in her toes.  
The following day she attended a recompression facility and 
was diagnosed with DCI.  She received three treatments over a 
three day period which improved her symptoms. 
May 2007 07/343 
The Coastguard was alerted when a diver developed symptoms 
of skin DCI.  He was brought ashore and taken by ambulance to 
hospital and then to a recompression facility for treatment.  
(Coastguard report). 
June 2007 07/113 
Two divers conducted a dive to 22m for 39 min with a 5 min 
stop at 6m.  2 hours 30 min later they dived to 30m.  During the 
ascent one of the pair lost control of her buoyancy and they 
made a faster than normal ascent to 5m.  They tried to conduct 
a stop at this depth but were not able to do so.  Their dive 
duration was 8 min.  One hour later both divers complained of a 
slight tingling.  They were placed on oxygen and advised to 
seek medical help.  Later that evening one of the pair was 
treated for DCI and the other was recompressed the following 
day. 
June 2007 07/344 
The Coastguard was alerted when a diver developed a pain in 
his left shoulder.  The diver was brought ashore and seen by a 
doctor.  He was then taken to a recompression facility for 
treatment for DCI.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2007 07/117 
Two divers using rebreathers conducted a 90 min dive to a 
maximum depth of 35m; they made no specific decompression 
stops.  1 hour later one of the pair began to feel unwell and 
sick.  He was placed on oxygen and taken by ambulance to 
hospital and then on to a recompression chamber for treatment. 
June 2007 07/116 
Two pairs of divers conducted a dive to a depth of 21m.  During 
the dive they checked air and a diver in one pair became 
concerned that a diver in the other pair was becoming low on 
air.  He took hold of this diver and gave him his octopus 
regulator.  He then opened his own drysuit dump valve and put 
air into the other diver's BCD.  They made a rapid ascent to the 
surface.  The buddy of the diver who was low on air went with 
them; the fourth diver made a normal ascent and joined them at 
the surface 3 min later.  Later, the diver who had been low on 
air experienced pain in his arm and a numbness in his left arm 
and leg.  The other diver had a pain in his neck and both had 
skin rashes.  They sought assistance and both divers were 
placed on oxygen.  They were taken to a recompression 
chamber for treatment.  The buddy, who had ascended with 
them, also received recompression treatment. 
 
June 2007 07/118 
A diver completed a series of three dives; two to 40m and 
another to 30m.  He then developed a rash on his chest, slight 
discomfort on his right hand side, aching joints and a 'warm 
feeling' around his heart.  Police notified the Coastguard and 
the diver was airlifted to a recompression chamber for 
treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2007 07/121 
The Coastguard was alerted when three divers developed 
symptoms of DCI.  All three had made rapid ascents from 
depths between 18 and 33m.  The boat returned to shore and 
the three divers were taken by ambulance to a recompression 
facility for treatment.  Four of the divers' buddies were also 
taken to the recompression facility for precautionary treatment.  
(Coastguard report). 
June 2007 07/128 
A diver conducted a 40 min dive to a depth of 14m with a 3 min 
stop at 6m.  20 hours later he dived to 17m with three other 
divers.  He was using a new mask and had continuous trouble 
trying to clear it.  During the dive he felt a 'strange sensation' in 
his back.  He returned to the shotline with the other divers and 
they ascended to 6m and carried out a safety stop.  He 
surfaced with a dive duration of 40 min.  At the surface he felt 
very fatigued.  The previous day he had been bitten by an 
insect and thought that he might have been experiencing an 
allergic reaction.  Once back in the boat he took two aspirins 
and laid down for a rest.  Later that evening he felt very tired 
again and sought diving medical advice.  He went to a 
recompression facility where a severe DCI was diagnosed.  He 
received three sessions of recompression treatment over a 
three day period. 
June 2007 07/349 
A diver suffering from symptoms of DCI was taken by 
ambulance to a recompression facility for treatment.  
(Coastguard report). 
June 2007 07/148 
A diver conducted a series of dives over a six day period with 
one day off in the middle.  Her last dive was to a maximum 
depth of 35m for 40 min.  Three days later she developed 
altered sensation in her hands, a numbness in her finger ends 
and hands, and pains in her elbow and knee joints.  She sought 
diving medical advice and was given three sessions of 
recompression therapy over a three day period; her symptoms 
were fully resolved.  All her dives were within computer limits 
and involved little decompression.  Her car journey home, which 
took place after her computer had cleared, took her to altitude. 
June 2007 07/129 
A diver conducted five dives over a five day period.  On her last 
dive she descended to a maximum depth of 27m with her 
buddy.  After 25 min they decided to surface.  The diver's 
computer showed that she needed to make a 5 min stop at 3m 
and her buddy a 2 min stop at 3m.  They ascended normally to 
6m and carried out a 1 min safety stop and then ascended to 
the 3m stop.  The diver who required the 5 min stop rose above 
her buddy and stopped at 2.5m.  Her computer registered an 
alarm.  She was unable to get back down to 3m and, after 3 
min, she ascended to the surface.  Shortly after leaving the 
water she complained of a slight feeling of 'pins and needles' in 
both hands.  She was placed on oxygen.  Her computer 
indicated that she had missed 8 min of stops at 3m.  Her buddy 
had not missed stops and had no symptoms.  The Coastguard 
was alerted and both divers were airlifted to a recompression 
facility.  The diver with symptoms was recompressed.  The diver 

  NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2007

was advised to take a PFO test.  She had commenced her 
menstrual cycle the day before and it is thought that this may 
have been a factor in her DCI. 
June 2007 07/307 
A rebreather diver dived to 72m.  His bottom time was 18 min 
and his total dive duration was 98 min.  20 min after surfacing 
he began to feel sick.  After a further 25 min he began to vomit.  
The Coastguard was alerted and the diver was airlifted to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2007 07/131 
A pair of divers conducted a 30 min dive to a maximum depth of 
20m.  Shortly after leaving the water one of the divers 
complained of a headache and a tingling in her fingers.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and the diver was placed on oxygen.   
The casualty became more distressed and she was taken by 
ambulance to hospital.  DCI was suspected and a PFO test was 
planned. 
June 2007 07/132 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 32m.  At 
18m one of the pair lost control of his buoyancy and made a 
faster than normal ascent to the surface missing 4 min of 
decompression stops.  His dive duration was 24 min.  His 
buddy completed the stops.  The diver who had missed stops 
experienced a 'fuzzy head' shortly afterwards.  He was placed 
on oxygen and medical advice was sought.  He was taken by 
ambulance to a recompression chamber for treatment. 
June 2007 07/308 
A diver conducted a 48 min dive to 28m including a 5 min stop 
at 6m and a 2 min stop at 5m.  He conducted a second dive to 
27m for 30 min with a 3 min stop at 6m.  Back on shore he 
developed pains in his upper arms and shoulders.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and the diver was airlifted to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  This diver had had DCI 
previously and had been diagnosed with a PFO two years 
earlier.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2007 07/127 
Two divers conducted a 30 min dive to a maximum depth of 
35m.  Later they dived to a maximum depth of 30m.  During this 
second dive, one of the pair experienced problems with a 
drysuit dump valve and started to make a buoyant ascent.  He 
tried to release air through his cuff seals and his buddy tried to 
slow the ascent.  They both rose to the surface quicker than 
normal.  Their dive duration was 27 min.  Their condition was 
monitored.  At the same time another pair in the group became 
separated.  One of the pair deployed a delayed SMB; the reel 
jammed and he made a rapid ascent to 15m at which point he 
was able to stop.  However, whilst sorting out the reel he rose 
rapidly to the surface.  Medical advice was sought and all three 
divers were placed on oxygen.  Shortly afterwards one of the 
first pair complained of tingling and 'pins and needles' in his 
arms and hands and the other diver of that pair started 
vomiting.  The third diver also started to vomit.  The divers were 
airlifted to a recompression facility.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2007 07/165 
Two divers conducted a 30 min dive to a maximum depth of 
32m.  A few minutes after getting back into the boat one of the 
pair complained of stomach pains and doubled over in pain.  
After a few minutes of trying to vomit he developed a pain in his 
knees.  He was placed on nitrox 50 and then oxygen.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and the casualty was given water.  He 
developed back pain.  On oxygen his symptoms worsened and 
then became fully resolved.  He was airlifted to a recompression 
chamber for treatment.  The casualty had conducted ten dives 
prior to this one in the last five days. 
June 2007 07/352 
The Coastguard was alerted when a diver developed symptoms 
of DCI.  The diver was brought ashore and taken by ambulance 
to a recompression facility for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2007 07/160 
Two divers dived to the top of a wreck at a depth of 27m.  There 
was a current running and they held onto the wreck and 
descended to 29m.  One of the pair was seen to be over-
weighted and they re-ascended to 27m.  After 10 min the dive 
leader indicated to the over-weighted diver that she should 
deploy a delayed SMB.  This diver had not done this before.  As 
the over-weighted diver ascended she reeled in the SMB and 
her mask started to flood.  She indicated the problem to the 
dive leader but was not able to clear the mask.  At 14m the dive 
leader's weightbelt started to slip off and she held onto the belt 
with one hand and the other diver with the other hand.  The dive 
leader felt her ears hurting and looked at her computer to find 
that they had dropped back to 20m.  The over-weighted diver 
was panicking and could not ascend.  The dive leader crossed 
her legs to trap the weightbelt and put some air into her BCD.  
At 14m she realised that her weightbelt was hanging from her 
crotch strap.  They began a fast ascent and despite attempting 
to dump air they made a rapid ascent to the surface missing a 
planned safety stop.  Back in the boat the over-weighted diver 
said she felt unwell.  The boat's skipper refused to deploy his 
oxygen set until there were symptoms.  The unwell diver was 
given nitrox 44.  She developed a headache and was placed on 
oxygen.  The dive leader developed a pain in her calf.  A 
recompression chamber was contacted by phone and, once 
ashore, both divers attended for recompression treatment. 
July 2007 07/353 
A diver made a rapid ascent from 23m.  He developed a pain in 
his shoulder and was placed on oxygen.  The Coastguard was 
alerted and the boat returned to shore.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2007 07/143 
A diver using trimix dived to 59m for a bottom time of 20 min.  
The following day he dived to 55m for a bottom time of 20 min.  
On the third day he dived to 57m for a bottom time of 20 min 
using trimix 17/24.  He ascended to his first stop at a depth of 
42m but became panicked and started to ascend.  At 12m he 
composed himself, switched to nitrox 80 and then surfaced.  His 
dive duration was 26 min.  His computer indicated that he had 
missed 37 min of stops.  He felt a pain in his upper arm and 
was placed on oxygen.  He was taken to a recompression 
facility for treatment.  On arrival he had a skin rash on both 
shoulders.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2007 07/144 
A pair of divers conducted a dive to a depth of 14m.  
Underwater visibility was low so they decided to terminate the 
dive.  They intended to stop at 5m for 3 min but made a fast 
ascent directly to the surface.  Their dive duration was 12 min.  
One of the pair developed a nose bleed and felt an unusual 
sensation in her arm.  The Coastguard was alerted and medical 
advice was sought.  The casualty was airlifted to a 
recompression facility for treatment which resolved her 
symptoms.  The casualty was inexperienced in diving in UK 
waters and thinks that she over-inflated her BCD.  (Coastguard 
report).

A diver conducted a dive to a wreck at a depth of 32m using 
nitrox 32.  The diver was wearing an additional jumper under 
their drysuit and had difficulty descending so the diver used the 
shotline to assist the descent.  The diver deployed a delayed 
SMB to make the ascent but the reel jammed at 27m.  The 
diver continued the ascent by winding the line around the reel, 
this resulted in a slow ascent.  The diver struggled to maintain a 
stop at 9m due to excessive buoyancy and, after 2 min they 
made an uncontrolled ascent to the surface.  The diver was 
placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  The diver 
developed a pain in their left knee and hip.  The diver was 
airlifted to a recompression facility for treatment.  (Coastguard 
report). 
July 2007 07/151 
A diver with signs of DCI was airlifted to a recompression 
facility.  (Media report). 
July 2007 07/153 
A diver conducted a dive to a depth of 30m.  After 26 min she 
conducted a 1 min stop at 9m and a 6 min stop at 6m.  After 
this dive her left shoulder, armpit and chest felt very itchy.  She 
took antihistamine tables.  She ate lunch, felt thirsty but didn't 
drink much.  After a 2 hour surface interval she dived to 23m for 
a drift dive.  A delayed SMB was deployed after 25 min and she 
made a slow ascent to 9m for a 1 min stop and then to 6m for a 
3 min stop.  During this stop she experienced a discomfort in 
her left breast which felt like suit squeeze.  She left the water 
and de-kitted.  Within minutes the discomfort became an 
intense pain which lasted for about 25 min.  The following 
morning the breast was swollen, uncomfortable and felt as if it 
were on fire.  Diving medical advice was sought and she was 
told that it was not diving related.  Then advice was sought from 
a recompression facility and she was aked to attend for 
examination.  She received recompression treatment which 
greatly eased her symptoms.  (Coastguard report).

A diver conducted a 30 min dive to 24m.  After the dive he 
developed chest pains and had difficulty breathing.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and the diver was airlifted to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2007 07/358 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 60m.  
They experienced a free flowing regulator and made a rapid 
ascent to the surface missing all stops.  Their dive duration was 
20 min.  They were recovered into their boat and placed on 
oxygen.  One of the divers developed a pain in their arms.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and the divers were airlifted to a 
recompression facility.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
July 2007 07/154 
A pair of divers conducted a dive to 30m.  One of the pair 
experienced mask squeeze.  He tried to adjust the mask.  The 
mask flooded and he cleared it.  He tried to signal to his buddy 
that he was uncomfortable.  The buddy misunderstood the 
signal, panicked and dragged him to the surface without any 
stops.  Their bottom time was 10 min.  The pair were placed on 
oxygen for 1 hour 30 min.  The following day he dived to 35m 
with two other divers.  On the ascent from this dive he planned 
to make a 10 min decompression stop at 15m.  He lost control 
of his buoyancy during this stop and made a rapid ascent from 
9m to the surface missing 9 min of decompression.  He was 
recovered into the boat and placed on oxygen.  He developed a 
tingling sensation in his left hand and right foot.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and the diver was airlifted to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2007 07/359 
The Coastguard was alerted when a diver developed a 
headache and a tingling in their arms.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2007 07/163 
Two divers conducted a dive to a wreck in a maximum depth of 
40m.  Their bottom time was 30 min and they completed 10 min 
of decompression on nitrox 80.  One of the divers was cold and 
shivering during the stops.  Shortly after surfacing one of the 
pair felt unwell and complained of blurred vision and black spots 
in his left eye and pain in his upper left arm.  He was placed on 
oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  The diver and his 
buddy were airlifted to a recompression facility.  The diver with 
DCI received treatment.  It was suggested that alcohol 
consumption the previous night may have contributed. 
July 2007 07/164 
A diver conducted a no stop dive to a maximum depth of 30m.  
About 11 hours later he dived again to 30m.  After the dive he 
developed 'pins and needles' in his side.  The Coastguard was 
alerted and the diver was airlifted to a recompression facility for 
treatment. 
July 2007 07/316 
A diver using trimix 10/50 conducted a dive to a maximum 
depth of 84m.  The following day he dived again to 84m for a 
total duration of 145 min with an extra 15 min at 6m as an 
additional safety stop.  After this dive he developed skin DCI.  
He was placed on oxygen and given fluids.  The Coastguard 
was alerted and diving medical advice was sought.  The diver 
was monitored and, as no other symptoms developed, no 
further action was taken.  (Coastguard report).

A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 28m.  His 
regulator flooded and he attempted to locate his pony regulator.  
Whilst doing so he lost his mask, inhaled some water, and 
made a rapid ascent to the surface.  After the dive he was 
'vague but orientated' and he had numbness in his hand and 
feet.  He was placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was 
alerted.  The diver was airlifted to a recompression facility.  
(Coastguard report). 
August 2007 07/174 
A diver conducted a 42 min dive to a maximum depth of 23m 
with a 1 min safety stop at 6m.  1 hour 40 min later she dived to 
24m for 54 min with a 1 min safety stop at 6m.  Some time after 
this dive she noticed bruising on her right shoulder and stomach 
which was itchy and sore when scratched.  She sought medical 
advice by phone and was told that she had indications of DCI 
and that emergency support would be organised.  She was 
placed on oxygen and waited.  Sometime later she was advised 
to contact the Coastguard and seek their help.  The Coastguard 
was alerted and the diver was taken by ambulance and 
helicopter to a recompression facility where she was treated for 
DCI.  Her symptoms fully resolved.  This diver had had similar 
episodes one and three years earlier and she was told that she 
almost certainly had a PFO for which she was seeking medical 
advice. 
August 2007 07/322 
A diver completed a 32 min dive to a maximum depth of 26m.  
After the dive he complained of pains across his chest and 
numbness in both legs.  The Coastguard was alerted and the 
diver and his buddy were airlifted to a recompression facility 
where the diver was treated for DCI.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2007 07/321 
The Coastguard assisted with a diver suffering from DCI and a 
back injury.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2007 07/360 
A diver conducted two dives in one day; the second was to 
about 15m.  He then developed a tingling and numbness in his 
right hand.  The Coastguard was alerted.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2007 07/169 
A trainee conducted a dive to 27m for 20 min.  Later they 
conducted a drift dive to a maximum depth of 18m.  During the 
dive the trainee became tired and out of breath and sank back 
down from 3m to the bottom.  The trainee became panicked 
and put air into their BCD.  The trainee's mask started to flood 
and caused them to gag and rush to the surface missing stops.  
Their dive duration was 20 min.  At the surface the trainee was 
exhausted and coughing up fluid.  The trainee's ears hurt and 
their hearing was muted.  The trainee remained exhausted and 
began to feel dizzy.  The Coastguard was alerted and the 
trainee was taken to a recompression facility for treatment.  
(Coastguard report). 
August 2007 07/178 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 28m using 
nitrox 36.  He spent most of the dive at 25m and the last 10 min 
at 21m.  He started his ascent at 41 min with 3 min of no stop 
time remaining.  His total dive duration was 50 min.  The 
following day he developed a dull ache in his right shoulder 
which he put down to a strain.  Three days after the dive he 
experienced a tingling in his right hand and arm.  His fingers 
were particularly sensitive to heat.  He attended a 
recompression facility and was treated for DCI.  This diver had 
been recompressed 7 weeks earlier following two hard working 
dives.  2 years previously he had been diagnosed with and 
treated for a PFO, and had had a number of skin DCIs over a 
number of years.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2007 07/361 
A diver suffering from DCI was taken by ambulance to a 
recompression facility.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2007 07/170 
A diver conducted a 70 min trimix dive to a wreck at a depth of 
55m.  4 hours later the diver again dived to 55m with a bottom 
time of 20 min and 35 min decompression.  Two hours after the 
last dive the diver experienced a headache, abdominal pain, an 
abdominal rash, and numbness to their left index finger, thumb 
and top lip.  Oxygen and fluids were administered and the diver 
was taken by ambulance and helicopter to a recompression 
facility.  A spinal DCI was diagnosed.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2007 07/172 
A diver conducted a 45 min dive to a depth of 4m.  After a 30 
min surface interval he conducted a wreck dive to a depth of 
27m.  At 27m he lost control of his buoyancy and rose to 25m.  
He was able to re-gain some control and rose to 20m at which 
point he lost control again and made a rapid ascent to the 
surface.  His dive duration was 15 min.  The Coastguard was 
alerted and the diver was airlifted to a recompression facility.  
By the time he arrived he had a pain in his shoulder and 
delayed reflexes.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2007 07/177 
A diver conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 37m.  
After 30 min he made a slow ascent including the required 
stops.  He was recovered into the boat and, 10 min later, the 
finger tips of his right hand went cold and numb.  He coughed a 
lot and developed a pain across the palm of his hand.  He was 
placed on oxygen.  After about 10 min the feeling in his hand 
returned to normal but he developed a migraine.  He was taken 
off the oxygen for about 15 min and sat up.  He felt sick and the 
numbness returned.  He coughed a lot and his migraine got 
worse.  He rested for the remainder of the day.  That evening 
his migraine was better but his shoulder, back and joints were 
sore.  He had a poor night's sleep.  The following day he 
contacted a recompression facility and attended there for 
treatment for lymphatic DCI.  This diver had been 
recompressed previously following a deep dive.  (Coastguard 
report). 
August 2007 07/175 
Two divers conducted a 24m dive.  The dive duration was 24 
min and it ended with a rapid ascent.  One of the pair developed 
a pain between his shoulder blades.  The Coastguard was 
alerted and the two were airlifted to a recompression facility for 
treatment.

recompression facility for treatment.  (Media report). 
August 2007 07/219 
A diver completed a 42 min dive to a maximum depth of 30m.  
During this dive he felt negatively buoyant and so, for his 
second dive, 2 hours later, he removed 2 kg from his weights; 
he also used a smaller cylinder.  His second dive was to a 
depth of 25m.  During the ascent from this dive he became

buoyant at about 10m and was unable to prevent himself from 
rising rapidly to the surface.  His dive duration was 39 min.  
Back in the boat he was placed on oxygen.  1 hour 30 min later 
he developed a pain in his upper left arm.  The Coastguard was 
contacted and diving medical advice was sought.  The diver 
attended a recompression facility for treatment.  (Coastguard

Three divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 34m.  
After 25 min one of the three deployed a delayed SMB and they 
started their ascent.  After a few metres one of the three looked 
down to see the diver with the SMB still on the bottom; he was 
having difficulty reeling in the line.  As he was low on air the 
diver continued his ascent while the third diver descended to 
help the diver with the reel.  The diver who was low on air left 
the bottom with 70 bar but used some of this up waiting for the 
diver with the SMB.  With 50 bar remaining he started to have 
buoyancy problems at 17m and he ascended quickly to 5m.  He 
then found that he had not dumped all the air from his BCD.  He 
did this and then descended back down to 6m.  He completed 
10 min of a 15 min stop requirement.  His computer went into 
error mode and he didn't know what his stop requirements 
were.  The other two divers ascended to him and he continued 
to conduct stops with them.  He then gave the ascend signal.  
The other divers responded with OK signals and he took this to 
mean that it was OK to ascend.  He ascended to the surface 
then realised that the other two divers were still conducting 
decompression.  They surfaced 20 min later.  Back in the boat it 
was found that the diver had missed stops.  The Coastguard 
was alerted.  The diver developed a numbness in his hand and 
was airlifted to a recompression facility for treatment.

A diver conducted a 35 min dive to a maximum depth of 33m 
with a 3 min stop at 3m.  After the dive she developed a pain in 
her shoulder.  The Coastguard was alerted and the casualty 
was taken by lifeboat to a recompression facility for treatment 
for DCI.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2007 07/256 
A diver conducted a 28 min dive to a maximum depth of 40m.  2 
hours 36 min later she dived to 40m for 30 min.  Following the 
second dive she felt very cold and, 2 hours after the dive, she 
noticed that the skin on her chest and back felt hot and itchy 
and she had a rash on her chest.  She was placed on nitrox 60 
and diving medical advice was sought.  The Coastguard was 
alerted and the diver was taken by lifeboat to a recompression 
facility for treatment of skin DCI.  Her condition was fully 
resolved. 
September 2007 07/241 
Three divers started down a shotline, during the descent they 
lost the line and reached the bottom at a depth of 28m.  20 min 
into the dive they deployed a delayed SMB and made their 
ascent including a 1 min safety stop at 6m.  When they surfaced 
they could not see their boat.  They inflated another SMB and 
dropped their weightbelts.  The boat had another two pairs of 
divers in the water and recovering them took some time.  It was 
then that they discovered that three divers were missing.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and a helicopter was tasked to search.  
The helicopter located the divers and guided their boat to them.  
Later, once ashore, one of these divers reported pains in his 
legs.  He was airlifted to a recompression facility for treatment 
for DCI. (Coastguard report). 
September 2007 07/372 
A diver reported to a recompression facility and was treated.  
(Coastguard report). 
September 2007 07/264 
A diver conducted a dive to a wreck in a maximum depth of 
34m.  Towards the end of his dive he deployed a delayed SMB 
to make his ascent.  As the buoy ascended he let its buoyancy 
pull him upwards, briefly, to get him off the bottom.  He then 
released the SMB reel again but realised that he was still 
ascending.  He dumped air from his drysuit to stop his ascent.  
At 18m he checked his computer and found that the ascent rate 
was too fast; he continued to dump air.  He reeled in the SMB 
line and then found that the buoy had deflated and sunk back 
down to him.  He re-deployed the SMB and continued his 
ascent to the first indicated stop.  He switched to nitrox 75, 
finished his decompression stops and surfaced.  His dive 
duration was 75 min including 25 min of decompression stops 
at depths between 9 and 4m.  Later that day he was helping to 
recover the boat onto its trailer when he started to feel dizzy.  
He had problems controlling his neck muscles and was sick.  
He was placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  He 
was airlifted to a recompression facility where he received three 
sessions of treatment for DCI. 
September 2007 07/263 
A diver conducted a series of two dives per day over a four day 
period.  Her last dive was to a maximum depth of 37m and, 
after about 25 min, her buddy deployed a delayed SMB to make 
their ascent.  There was a current running and the buoy line lay 
at an angle.  The diver kept a loose contact with the line, letting 
go occasionally to dump air from her drysuit via a cuff dump.  At 
6m she let go again and attempted to dump air in order to 
conduct a 3 min safety stop.  However, she was positively 
buoyant and made a slow ascent directly to the surface, missing 
the stop.  The diver was advised to take oxygen but was told 
that if she did so the emergency services would be alerted and 
that an ambulance would be sent to assist.  She was unwilling 
to take this course of action because she had not missed 
mandatory stops and had no symptoms.  Later that day she 
undertook a second, shallow dive.  That evening she developed 
symptoms of DCI and was taken to the local hospital and

placed on oxygen.  The following day she was airlifted to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  The diver suffers from 
rheumatoid arthritis and had experienced a previous DCI 
incident.  It is thought that these factors, coupled with the fact 
that she conducted a number of consecutive dives, contributed 
to the incident.

sought.  The diver was taken by lifeboat to a recompression 
facility.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2007 07/260 
A diver conducted a 31 min dive to a depth of 30m with a 3 min 
stop at 6m and a 2 min stop at 3m.  10 min after the dive she 
developed a headache and looked pale.  10 min later the 
situation was unchanged, the diver was placed on oxygen and 
the Coastguard was alerted.  40 min after surfacing the diver 
developed 'pins and needles' in her right foot.  The Coastguard 
was informed and the boat returned to harbour.  When they 
reached shore the diver's right leg was feeling numb and she 
was taken by ambulance to a recompression facility where she 
was treated for DCI. 
September 2007 07/376 
A diver conducted a dive to 37m and a second dive to 35m.  
After the second dive the diver developed a shoulder pain.  The 
Coastguard was alerted.  (Coastguard report).

Injury / Illness 
 
 
October 2006  07/199 
A dive boat dropped a number of divers into the water to dive a 
wreck.  The divers were requested to surface up a fixed shot and 
then to swim away from it so that they could be recovered.  
There was an RHIB tied to the shot buoy.  One pair surfaced and 
signalled that they wanted to be picked up.  Their boat came to 
pick them up but, due to the proximity of a harbour wall and the 
RHIB, it had to move away for another attempt.  The divers were 
carried back towards the shot buoy.  The dive boat returned and 
the divers held on to a line from the boat waiting to board.  Again 
the boat had to move away and the divers were told to let go of 
the rope.  They did so and the back of the boat swung over the 
divers.  The moving propeller struck the leg of one of the divers 
and both were both pushed underwater.  When they surfaced 
they were recovered into the RHIB and the skipper of this boat 
radioed their dive boat saying that he would take them quickly to 
the shore and asking that they recover his divers.  The injured 
diver had cuts to the left leg of her drysuit and a severe pain in 
her right foot; her fins had been torn off.  Once ashore she found 
extensive bruising to her left leg from foot to knee but no 
lacerations.  She was taken to hospital for examination.  At that 
time it was thought that there was no fracture.  The following day 
she visited her local hospital where x rays revealed that she had 
suffered a broken right toe.

A trainee diver conducted two dives to a maximum depth of 7m.  
She was not aware of any problems during the dives.  That 
evening blood was seen coming from one of her ears.  She 
sought medical advice and damage to the ear was diagnosed.  
Fourteen years earlier she had had a skin graft in this ear to 
replace her ear drum; this fact was not made known to the dive 
organisers before the dive. 
October 2006 07/277 
A diver complained of headaches and confusion following a dive 
to 30m, no medical treatment given.  (Coastguard report). 
November 2006 07/200 
A diver conducted two dives to a maximum depth of 18m to 
practice controlled buoyant lifts from 18 to 10m.  The following 
day she again engaged in controlled buoyant lift drills from 18 to 
9m and then an alternative air source drill to 5m where she made 
a 3 min safety stop.  Her dive duration was 16 min.  During the 
second lift she felt lightheaded for a few seconds.  After an 
interval of 1 hour 38 min she dived to a maximum depth of 17m 
for 26 min.  The following day she awoke with a numbness and 
sensitivity around her right eye, with the eye being very sore.  
She sought advice from a recompression facility and attended for 
examination.  No DCI was confirmed but the diver was given a 
precautionary recompression treatment.  After the treatment the 
symptoms had improved but a second treatment was felt 
unnecessary.  It was thought that the problem could be sinusitis 
or a nerve problem.  She was following up treatment with her 
doctor. 
November 2006 07/049 
A diver conducted a 38 min dive to a maximum depth of 46m 
with a 3 min safety stop at 6m.  2 hours 16 min later he dived to 
33m for 35 min with a 3 min safety stop at 6m.  21 hours 59 min 
later he dived to 26m for 64 min with a 22 min stop at 6m.  About 
90 min later he noticed a pain in his right forearm.  He put this 
pain down to muscular strain from lifting heavy diving equipment.  
The pain faded and then increased over time.  Early the following 
morning he awoke with 'pins and needles' in his right hand; he 
moved his hand, restored the circulation, and the sensation 
resolved.  During the evening of the day following the dive the 
pain in his arm increased and he sought diving medical advice.  
He attended a recompression facility.  Since the pain varied with 
wrist movement it was thought not to be DCI but he was given 
precautionary recompression treatment.  The pain did not 
change and a tendon strain was confirmed. 
December 2006 07/050 
An instructor and two trainees entered the water using a stride 
entry from a platform.  They exchanged OK signals and 
descended.  After 14 min they resurfaced with one of the 
trainees complaining of a loose fin.  The fin buckle was found to 
be broken and the fin was replaced.  The trainee had shown 
signs of buoyancy control problems and the instructor checked 
that he was happy to continue.  They descended once more.  1 
min later they resurfaced with the troubled trainee complaining of 
a pain in both ears.  This trainee left the water while the other 
two divers continued their dive.  The trainee with the ear problem 
reported that, during the second descent, he had experienced 
increasing pain in both ears with a sudden sharp pain in his right 
ear; he also felt slightly disorientated.  After the dive the pain 
continued and he sought medical advice.  A bruised ear drum 
was diagnosed.

Lifeboat launched to help diver with illness.  (RNLI report). 
December 2006 07/018 
A diver completed a 20 min dive to a depth of 22m.  Later he felt 
unwell and dizzy.  He was placed on oxygen, placed in a warm 
environment and given water.  He recovered and no further 
action was taken. 
December 2006 07/019 
A diver under training was standing on a landing stage preparing 
to enter the water.  He bent over to wash his mask out.  He 
slipped and fell, hurting his right ankle.  He was taken by 
ambulance to hospital, however, no fractures were found and he 
was discharged later that day. 
February 2007 07/034 
Two divers conducted a 27 min dive to a maximum depth of 20m 
including a 5 min stop at 5m.  Immediately after the dive one of 
the pair lost coordination and control of her arms and legs; she 
could not stand.  She was placed on oxygen and the emergency 
services were called.  She quickly recovered.  She was 
examined by paramedics and, in consultation with a 
recompression facility, it was decided that no further action was 
required.  It is thought that she had suffered from hypothermia; 
her undersuit was not very thick. 
March 2007 07/037 
Two divers conducted a 50 min dive to a depth of 24m.  90 min 
later they dived again.  One of the pair was using a rebreather.  
After 2 min, at a depth of 6m, the rebreather diver felt unwell and 
changed to his bale out cylinder which contained trimix 10/50.  
The problem persisted.  His buddy realised that there was a 
problem and brought him to the surface.  At the surface the 
troubled diver had stopped breathing.  The alarm was raised and 

  NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2007

the diver was removed from the water.  The emergency services 
were alerted and the casualty was placed on oxygen.  He quickly 
recovered and he was taken to hospital for examination.  He was 
discharged later the same day. 
March 2007 07/055 
A trainee and an instructor entered the water and commenced a 
dive.  They carried out buoyancy checks at 3 and 6m.  The 
trainee needed more weight and they surfaced after 9 min to 
resolve this problem.  When they dived again their computers 
indicated a second dive.  This dive was to 8m for 13 min.  2 
hours 7 min later they made a further dive.  During this dive they 
descended to 16m for 2 min then continued at a maximum depth 
of 12m.  15 min into the dive the trainee became buoyant and 
rose to a depth of 7m before he was able to regain control.  He 
re-descended to 12m and continued the dive.  At the end of the 
dive they made a slow ascent to  6m for a 1 min safety stop and 
then to 3m for a 3 min safety stop before surfacing.  Later that 
afternoon the trainee began to feel 'pins and needles' in his left 
hand and forearm.  This symptom progressed to include his right 
hand and forearm.  The diver thought that this was due to an old 
injury that had been aggravated by the dives.  During the 
evening of the following day he noticed some chest discomfort 
which he put down to eating spicy food.  The symptoms 
persisted and the following evening the diver sought medical 
advice.  Tests were conducted and it was concluded that the 
problems were unlikely to be diving related.  Three days later the 
diver still had the symptoms although they were less intense. 
March 2007 07/058 
Two divers were walking down some steps towards their dive 
entry point.  One of the pair slipped and sustained a suspected 
broken ankle.  He was taken to hospital for treatment. 
April 2007 07/061 
A diver conducted a series of dives over a three day period.  On 
day two he dived to 37m for 34 min with a 4 min stop at 6m.  4 
hours 50 min later he dived to 17m for 53 min with a 3 min stop 
at 6m.  17 hours later, on day three, he dived to 43m for 80 min 
including a 35 min stop at 3m.  After these dives the diver made 
a ferry journey and then started his drive home.  That evening, 
on the way home, he noticed a pain in his left shoulder and, 
shortly afterwards, in his right shoulder too.  He breathed oxygen 
and sought medical advice by phone.  He went with his buddy to 
hospital and was transported to a recompression facility.  He and 
his buddy were given recompression treatment.  During this 
treatment the pain fluctuated but did not ease.  Some time later 
he was given a second session of recompression treatment with 
the same result.  A neck injury was diagnosed and not DCI.  He 
was given painkillers and kept in hospital overnight.  The 
following morning the pain had gone. 
April 2007 07/091 
A diver conducted a dive to 16m for 45 min.  After a surface 
interval of 3 hours 30 min he dived, with a buddy, to 15m and 
undertook a drift dive which took them to a maximum depth of 
19m.  During this dive the buddy had problems with a surface 
current pulling on the marker buoy.  After a while they heard their 
RHIB and felt a tugging on the line.  The first diver took the reel 
and they started their ascent.  At 6m they stopped for a 3 min 
safety stop.  However the SMB line was not vertical as it was still 
being pulled by the surface current; this made it difficult for the 
diver to maintain his depth control.   His depth fluctuated 
between 3 and 8m.  The diver became increasingly concerned 
that there might be a problem in the boat and began to 
experience ear problems.  After 3 min the diver indicated to his 
buddy that all was not well and they surfaced.  At the surface the 
diver immediately experienced a bad headache; he informed his 
buddy and they were recovered into the boat.  The diver was 
placed on oxygen and they returned to the shore.  Once ashore 
he sought medical advice and was driven to a recompression 
facility for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
April 2007 07/068 
A diver was climbing down a ladder to get to the access point for 
a quarry dive.  She fell from the ladder and dropped head first 
onto rocks from a height of 4m.  A mountain rescue team 
recovered her to a point where she could be airlifted to hospital.  
She suffered a fractured skull and vertebrae. 
April 2007 07/072 
A diver was engaged in a drysuit training course.  The group 
started its descent and at about 3m the diver felt breathless and 
returned to the surface.  He settled down and re-descended.  At 
about 19m he felt breathless again and signalled that he wanted 
to ascend.  The instructor brought him to the surface, making an 
ineffective attempt to complete a safety stop on the way.  At the 
surface the instructor ditched the trainee's weightbelt.  It is 
thought that the weightbelt narrowly missed another diver who 
was below them.  This diver brought the belt back to the surface.  
The troubled diver was placed on oxygen but no subsequent ill 
effects were experienced. 
April 2007 07/075 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 20m.  One 
was using a rebreather and the other an open circuit air system.  
They spent 15 min at about 6m and then descended to 20m. 
After a dive time of 24 min they started to re-ascend.  As they did 
so the rebreather diver began to feel short of breath; he thought 
that this was due to the cold water.  At 6m he felt more out of 
breath.  He checked his oxygen partial pressure and it was 
correct.  The condition worsened and he attempted to use his 
buddy's octopus regulator and then rose quickly to the surface.  
His dive duration was 28 min.  At the surface he inflated his 
BCD, closed the rebreather loop and lay back gasping for air.  
Two other divers assisted him from the water.  His buddy 
surfaced safely a few min later.  The rebreather diver believes 
that he suffered from hypercapnia.  The rebreather scrubber had 
not been changed for 5 weeks although it had only been used for 
1 hour.  He suffered no subsequent ill effects.  (07/065 relates). 
April 2007 07/076 
A trainee made a stride entry into a swimming pool, holding his 
regulator and mask correctly, as instructed.  As he entered the 
water he felt a knock to his teeth, but there was no apparent 
injury and he continued training.  The following day he began to 
feel unwell, he slept during the afternoon and awoke feeling cold 
and shaking.  He ate a meal but immediately vomited it back 
again.  He continued to feel unwell and four days later he saw a 
doctor.  The top of his mouth and gums were covered in ulcers.  
Two days later he saw his own doctor; a viral infection was 
diagnosed and he was given antibiotics.  His top teeth are 
bridged and he visited his dentist for a check; no damage was 
found.  It is thought that the regulator may have cut his mouth 
allowing an infection to set in. 
April 2007 07/077 
A diver conducted a 31 min dive to a maximum depth of 11m.  6 
hours 15 min later he dived to 6m for 36 min.  After this dive he 
felt dizzy and nauseous.  He drank some water then vomited 
repeatedly; some of the vomit was bloody.  Diving medical 
advice was sought and he was taken to hospital.  He was placed 
on oxygen and a full medical examination was conducted.  No 
treatment was found to be necessary.  The diver suffers from 
migraine with aura.  He had previously tested negatively for a 
PFO but intended to have the test repeated.

May 2007 07/100 
Two divers had completed a dive to 17m for 20 min including a 3 
min stop at 6m.  The shotline on which they were ascending was 
30m long in a depth of 20m.  As the line was slack the divers 
were not underneath the shot buoy.  When the divers were at a 
depth of 1m the boat drifted back over them.  The cox did not 
realise that the divers were there and restarted the engine.  
Despite the buddy's attempts to assist, the propeller hit one of 
the divers' head.  Back on the boat the injury was examined and, 
once ashore, the diver was taken to hospital.  The wound was 
treated with stitches and glue. 
May 2007 07/102 
A diver entered the water and descended a shotline.  He 
equalised his ears at 2 to 3m.  He tried again at around 5m; his 
right ear cleared but his left ear was painful at first.  He tried 
again at about 8m and again his left ear was painful.  He 
ascended a little to try to resolve the problem and then 
descended to about 11m.  His left ear was still a problem so he 
aborted the dive and surfaced.  His left ear continued to give 
trouble; it felt as if it was pressurised from the inside.  He was 
seen by a medical specialist and diagnosed with a perforated 
eardrum. 
May 2007 07/084 
A trainee was practicing an emergency ascent from a depth of 
6m.  At the surface she attempted to orally inflate her BCD as 
part of the training drill.  She began to panic; the instructor 
attempted to assist but the trainee inhaled water and panicked 
more.  She was removed from the water and placed on oxygen.  
Initially she recovered well but 2 hours 30 min later she began to 
panic again.  She was taken by ambulance to hospital. 
June 2007 07/190 
Two divers were launching an RHIB from a trailer on a slipway.  
They untied the rope securing the boat to the trailer and tried to 
unhook the winch hook from the boat.  The winch line was too 
tight so they unwound the winch to provide some slack.  They 
were still unable to unhook the clip as it fouled the rollers on the 
winch support so they pushed the boat a short distance to clear 
the rollers.  This caused the handle of the winch to spin round 
and it struck one of the pair in the eye.  The casualty was taken 
to hospital and from there to a specialist eye unit.  After some 
checks he was returned to hospital from where he was finally 
released. 
June 2007 07/114 
A diver was engaged in a series of dives over a 5 day period.  
He conducted one dive on day one, then missed two days 
because of bad weather.  On day four he undertook two dives.  
On the last day he dived to 28m for 40 min with a 5 min stop plus 
an additional 3 min safety stop at 6m.  Then 1 hour 44 min later 
he dived to 20m for 53 min with a 4 min stop plus an additional 3 
min safety stop, at 6m.  Back on the boat the diver complained of 
'pins and needles' in his left foot.  He was placed on oxygen and 
the Coastguard was alerted.  The symptoms subsided but then 
returned to his hands and fingers, chest and stomach.  The diver 
became distressed.  The boat returned to harbour and was met 
by an ambulance which took him to a recompression facility.  On 
arrival his symptoms had resolved but he was given 
precautionary recompression treatment.  It was finally concluded 
that DCI was unlikely.  It is thought that tiredness and 
dehydration may have been contributing factors. 
June 2007 07/110 
A 66 year old diver completed a 40 min dive to a depth of 35m.  
After surfacing he complained of chest pains.  The Coastguard 
was alerted and medical advice was sought.  The diver was 
airlifted to shore where he was met by a diving doctor.  After a 
full examination the casualty was released with suspected 
indigestion. 
June 2007 07/119 
A diver lost consciousness on the seabed at a depth of 20m.  
Her buddy brought her to the surface.  She was taken back to 
the shore where she regained consciousness.  She was then 
taken by ambulance to hospital.  A lifeboat and a helicopter were 
also tasked to assist.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
June 2007 07/202 
A boat with twin propellers was manoeuvring towards a wreck 
marker buoy.  Two divers jumped into the water ahead of a 
signal from the skipper.  The engines were cut but not before 
one of the divers had been dragged onto one of the propellers by 
his BCD.  Other divers entered the water but the diver managed 
to cut himself free, cutting himself in the process.  He was 
recovered into the boat.  The Coastguard was alerted and the 
boat returned to shore.  The diver's injuries were not serious and 
he reported to hospital for treatment. 
June 2007 07/112 
A diver made his first dive of the year to a depth of 24m for 30 
min using nitrox 32.  The following day he dived to a wreck in a 
maximum depth of 34m.  He expected to find the shot on the 
wreck at about 24m and became unnerved when he found 
himself at 34m.  He began to panic and to hyperventilate.  His 
buddy assisted him to make a normal ascent to the surface.  The 
diver experienced difficulties getting back onto the boat.  Once 
aboard he seemed to be in distress, his nose was bleeding, and 
he stopped breathing for a while but remained conscious.  He 
was placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  He was 
airlifted to a recompression facility but recompression treatment 
was not deemed necessary. 
June 2007 07/347 
The Coastguard was alerted when a diver began to feel unwell 
after swallowing some water.  Once ashore the diver was taken 
to a doctor.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2007 07/348 
The Coastguard was alerted when a diver surfaced and was 
placed on oxygen.  A helicopter was tasked to assist but no 
further action was found necessary.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2007 07/135 
A diver surfaced beside an SMB and seemed to be in distress.  
A line was thrown to her from a boat but she made no attempt to 
take hold of it.  Another diver entered the water to assist but he 
did not make any attempt open her airway.  The casualty was 
frothing from the mouth and her lips were turning blue.  A 
member of the dive boat's crew jumped into the water to assist; 
this crew member was not wearing any protective clothing.  The 
crew member took hold of the diver and turned her face up; she 
then gave five rescue breaths.  She tried to inflate the casualty's 
BCD and suit but there was no air so she orally inflated the 
casualty's BCD.  Once buoyancy had been achieved she 
dropped the casualty's weightbelt.  The boat's skipper attempted 
to pick them up but sea and wind conditions plus other divers on 
the surface prevented this.  Another boat came to assist and a 
line was clipped to a D ring on the casualty's equipment.  She 
was lifted by this line but the clip broke and she fell back into the 
water.  A second attempt was successful.  The rescuer then 
boarded the boat and gave further rescue breaths.  CPR was 
started and after four cycles the casualty started to breathe 
without assistance.  She was placed on oxygen.  The boat

returned to shore and a lifeboat assisted.  The casualty was 
taken to hospital and made a full recovery. 
June 2007 07/191 
A dive boat, which had just finished its diving, was hailed by 
another dive boat in the area.  This other boat contained a diver 
who was unwell.  The first boat offered to take the unwell diver to 
shore.  The Coastguard was alerted and the unwell diver was 
taken ashore to be met by an ambulance.  She was given fluids 
en route.  It was a very warm day and the diver, who had not 
been in the water, was found to be suffering from dehydration 
and seasickness. 
June 2007 07/310 
Two divers completed a dive to a maximum depth of 42m.  After 
the dive they began to feel unwell.  The Coastguard was alerted 
and the divers were taken by lifeboat to a recompression facility 
for a check up and from there they were taken to hospital for 
observation.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
June 2007 07/408 
Lifeboat launched to help diver with illness.  (RNLI report). 
June 2007 07/192 
A trainee diver conducted a 33 min dive to 11m.  4 hours 13 min 
later she dived to 14m for 29 min.  After this dive she complained 
of a sore right elbow.  When the boat returned to shore the diver 
was feeling better although the soreness was still present.  
Medical advice was sought and a muscular strain was 
diagnosed.  She was advised to re-hydrate. 
June 2007 07/139 
A pair of divers conducted a 19 min dive to 21m with a 3 min 
safety stop at 6m.  5 min after this dive they dived to 6m for 26 
min to practice diving skills.  After this second dive one of the 
pair began to feel unwell and an ambulance was called.  The 
casualty vomited and became unresponsive at times.  She was 
taken by ambulance to hospital. 
July 2007 07/252 
A diver conducted a 60 min dive to a maximum depth of 36m 
including a 2 min stop at 9m and a 6 min stop at 6m.  About 1 
hour later the diver started to feel dizzy.  He lost all sense of 
balance and had to lie down.  Diving medical advice was sought.  
The diver was placed on oxygen and taken to hospital.  From 
hospital he was taken to a recompression facility where he 
received three sessions of treatment.  His symptoms did not 
change and it was suggested that he had suffered a middle ear 
barotrauma as a result of an existing ear infection, although the 
diver was unaware of this infection.  He made a full recovery. 
July 2007 07/312 
A diver conducted a 44 min dive to a depth of 27m.  2 hours 25 
min later he dived to 33m.  As he entered the water for the 
second dive he hurt his back.  When he left the water from the 
second dive he twisted himself and the pain in his neck 
increased.  The Coastguard was alerted and diving medical 
advice was sought.  The diver was taken to a recompression 
facility but no symptoms of DCI were found.  The diver was 
transferred to hospital for observation.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2007 07/152 
A pair of divers were diving in a quarry.  They became 
disorientated and moved into deeper, darker, colder water.  One 
of the pair became tangled in his SMB line and whilst trying to 
sort this out they sank into deeper water.  Their actions stirred up 
the silt and the visibility dropped to near zero.  One of the pair 
panicked and made an emergency ascent to the surface.  He 
arrived at the surface unconscious with his regulator out and his 
mask off.  His buddy had tried to hold him but he too began to 
panic and also made a rapid ascent to the surface.  At the 
surface the buddy shouted for help.  The unconscious diver did 
not seem to be breathing but the buddy was too distressed and 
had chest pains that prevented him from helping.  The pair were 
recovered to the side of the quarry.  The unconscious diver was 
resuscitated and the pair were taken to a recompression facility 
for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2007 07/234 
An instructor took three trainees to a depth of 15m to carry out 
mask clearing drills.  One of the students breathed water up her 
nose and started to cough; her mask was on but not fully 
cleared.  The trainee began to panic and the instructor took hold 
of her to calm her.  She again inhaled water and the instructor 
used a controlled buoyant lift to bring her to the surface; the 
other trainees followed.  The instructor towed the trainee to the 
side and she left the water.  She was placed on oxygen and the 
emergency services were alerted.  Initially a helicopter was 
tasked but then stood down.  The trainee was taken by 
ambulance to hospital.  She was discharged the same day and 
given antibiotics. 
July 2007 07/355 
A diver developed chest pain and a sore muscle at the back of 
his shoulder having completed two dives two days previously.  
The Coastguard was alerted and the diver was brought ashore.  
(Coastguard report). 
July 2007 07/356 
After a dive to 12m a diver developed chest pain and began 
coughing up blood. The Coastguard was alerted and he was 
brought ashore.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2007 07/162 
A diver using a modified rebreather surfaced rapidly from a depth 
of 16m, leaving his rebreather on the seabed.  He surfaced 
under an RHIB and struck his head on the hull, knocking himself 
out and severely injuring his head.  He was recovered into the 
boat and the Coastguard was alerted.  The casualty was airlifted 
to hospital.  He was given precautionary recompression 
treatment. 
July 2007 07/415 
Lifeboat launched to help diver with illness.  (RNLI report). 
July 2007 07/167 
A trainee conducted three ascents from 5m practicing alternative 
air source drills and then dived to a maximum depth of 13m for 
34 min.  2 hours 20 min later he dived to 20m.  He spent 2 min at 
this depth and then ascended slowly up a wall to a depth of 6m.  
He then made two ascents from 6m practicing further drills.  On 
surfacing from the last ascent the trainee complained of a pain in 
his left ear.  The pain worsened and the divers left the water.  
Once out of the water a small amount of blood was seen coming 
from the diver's ear.  He sought medical advice and a perforated 
eardrum was diagnosed. 
July 2007 07/235 
An instructor and two trainees were engaged in navigation and 
delayed SMB deployment training.  The three conducted their 
planned compass swims to a maximum depth of 21m.  One of 

NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2007                          
©BSAC - 2007   19 
the trainees used her air faster than expected.  All three 
deployed their delayed SMBs and they started their ascent.  The 
trainee who was lowest on air had problems winding her reel in 
as it was very small in size.  The instructor swapped reels with 
her.  This trainee then lost a fin; the other trainee saw it go and 
caught it.  The instructor refitted the fin.  Their ascent was slow 
and at 15m the trainee indicted that she had run out of air.  The 
instructor gave the trainee her octopus regulator and took hold of 
her.  The trainee took the regulator into her mouth but breathed 
an air-water mixture and so she spat it out.  The instructor gave 
her the regulator again but again she spat it out.  The trainee 
tried to struggle free but the instructor kept hold of her.  They 
sank back to the bottom and the trainee became unresponsive.  
The instructor and the other trainee took hold of her and swam to 
the surface.  At the surface the other trainee shouted for help 
and helped the instructor to drop the casualty's weightbelt.  The 
casualty was unconscious and not breathing.  The instructor 
gave her rescue breaths.  She was recovered into a boat and 
brought to the shore.  The casualty was placed on oxygen and 
she recovered consciousness.  A helicopter and an ambulance 
were called but the casualty elected not to go to hospital.

August 2007 07/236 
A diver conducted a 26 min dive to a depth of 21m.  90 min later 
he dived to 21m for 38 min.  He dived on air but used trimix 
18/37 between 20 and 10m on the second dive.  An hour after 
the second dive he began to feel unwell.  He was placed on 
oxygen and was sick twice.  Diving medical advice was sought 
and he was told to continue to monitor for other symptoms.  
These were the diver's first dives after being recompressed six 
months earlier. 
August 2007 07/319 
A diver conducted a 20 min dive to 17m and a 25 min dive to 
20m.  The following day he dived to 24m for 28 min and then 
28m for 28 min.  After this last dive he felt a pressure on his 
chest and had difficulty breathing.  The Coastguard was alerted 
and the diver and his buddy were airlifted to a recompression 
facility.  It is not thought that the diver had DCI.  (Coastguard 
report). 
August 2007 07/325 
A diver conducted a 50 min dive to a maximum depth of 10m.  At 
the end of his dive he made a rapid ascent.  The diver injured his 
hand and the Coastguard was alerted.  The boat returned to 
shore and the diver was treated at the scene by the ambulance 
crew.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2007 07/210 
A trainee diver undertook a short dive to a maximum depth of 
14m.  At about 4m he experienced some discomfort in his right 
ear which felt like a 'bubbling sensation'.  When the diver 
removed his hood a small amount of blood was seen coming 
from his right ear.  Medical advice was sought and a burst 
eardrum was diagnosed.  It is thought that a large amount of wax 
in the diver's ear had caused a reversed ear. 
August 2007 07/238 
A diver was participating in a deep diving course.  At 25m the 
diver started to ascend and at 22m signalled that he wanted to 
go up.  This diver then started to remove his equipment.  The 
instructor took control and brought the diver to the surface with a 
controlled buoyant lift.  The diver was placed on oxygen but 
experienced no subsequent ill effects.  He stated that he had not 
had much sleep the night before.  It is thought that narcosis 
played a part in this incident. 
August 2007 07/261 
Two divers completed a wreck dive and surfaced using the 
shotline.  At the surface they moved away from the shotline to 
allow the boat to recover them.  The boat approached them at 
speed and was rolling in the swell.  One of the pair was able to 
grab hold of the boat's ladder and she started to climb.  The 
other diver was hit on the shoulder by the ladder, as the boat 
rolled, and she was pushed underwater.  The injured diver was 
able to climb the ladder onto the boat.  She was assisted to 
remove her kit.  She was extremely distressed, hyperventilating, 
shaking and crying.  Her shoulder was found to have been 
bruised. 
August 2007 07/227 
A diver conducted a 38 min dive to a depth of 37m with a 12 min 
stop at 4m.  1 hour 20 min later he dived to 6m for 31 min.  
About 3 hours after this dive he experienced a slight pain in his 
left forearm muscle.  The following morning he had a dull ache in 
his left elbow and it was painful when bent.  He sought medical 
advice and was taken, on oxygen, to a recompression facility for 
treatment.  Recompression treatment did not change the 
symptoms and it was concluded that he had suffered a muscle 
injury not DCI.  Two days after the dive his elbow was almost 
back to normal. 
August 2007 07/213 
A diver conducted a 29 min dive to a depth of 35m.  1 hour 42 
min later she dived to 20m for 41 min.  1 hour 45 min later she 
made a third dive to 20m.  10 min into this dive she ran out of air.  
She made a fast free ascent to the surface.  It is thought that she 
took in some water during this ascent.  The diver was placed on 
oxygen and diving medical advice was sought.  The diver was 
taken to hospital for treatment for suspected lung damage.  The 
diver had run out of air because she had entered the water using 
her pony regulator by mistake. 
August 2007 07/366 
The Coastguard was alerted when a diver became ill.  He was 
taken to hospital and kept under observation.  (Coastguard 
report). 
September 2007 07/215 
A diver used a lift to get back into a dive boat at the end of her 
dive.  Sea conditions were rough and as she stepped off the lift 
she grabbed for a rope, missed it, her leg slipped and she fell 
twisting and injuring one of her knees severely.  The heavy 
diving equipment that she was using made the injury worse.  She 
was taken to hospital for treatment. 
September 2007 07/230 
A trainee diver conducted a stride entry from a harbour wall.  
During the jump he let go of his mask, spare regulator and 
gauges that he had been holding.  As he hit the water either the 
spare regulator or one of his gauges hit his chin causing a cut.  
The injury was not noticed at first but was subsequently identified 
during the dive.  After the dive the trainee sought medical 
attention for the cut.  The following day the trainee reported an 
ear pain.  An ear infection was diagnosed. 
September 2007 07/221 
A diver conducted a dive with two others.  He became separated 
from them and surfaced in an area busy with boat traffic.  He 
struck his head on the hull of an RHIB and became unconscious.

He was recovered into this boat and the Coastguard was alerted.  
The diver regained consciousness and was airlifted to hospital 
for treatment. 
September 2007 07/262 
An instructor prepared his rebreather for a planned dive to a 
depth of 30m.  The scrubber canister had been recently refilled 
and had been used on two previous dives of 30 min duration 
each to a maximum depth of 10m.  On entering the water he 
suffered a significant flooding of his drysuit.  He pulled on the 
front entry zip to check that it was closed.  His respiration rate 
became very fast and he thought that he might be suffering from 
hypercapnia.  He switched to his bale out cylinder.  This 
regulator appeared to free flow and he was unable to get enough 
air from it.  He gave the distress signal, his buddy inflated his 
BCD, and he was recovered into the boat.  His respiration rate 
was still very fast and he was placed on oxygen.  The 
Coastguard was alerted.  Once ashore he was taken to a 
recompression facility; he was not recompressed and was 
discharged 1 hour later.  Subsequent examination found no 
problem with the rebreather. 
September 2007 07/336 
A diver conducted a 25 min dive to a maximum depth of 18m 
with a 3 min stop at 5m.  After the dive he complained of a 
tightness in his chest, difficulty breathing and he coughed up 
blood.  The diver was brought back to the shore and the 
Coastguard was alerted.  The diver was taken by ambulance to 
hospital.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2007 07/245 
A trainee diver conducted a 40 min dive to a maximum depth of 
4m.  She did not wear a hood as she found it claustrophobic.  
After the dive she developed a headache.  She was given fluids 
and her headache started to ease. 
September 2007 07/265 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 35m.  He 
equalised his ears normally at about 6m and 10m.  He 
experienced some discomfort but felt that his ears had cleared.  
At 20m he felt that his hood was too tight and then had an 
intense pain in his left ear.  After about 10 seconds the pain went 
and he completed a dive of 33 min duration with a 1 min stop at 
9m and a 5 min stop at 6m.  After the dive blood was seen to be 
coming from his ear and there was blood in his mask.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and diving medical advice was sought.  
He made no further dives that day and visited his doctor for 
further attention. 
September 2007 07/247 
A dive boat was returning to harbour after a day's diving.  One of 
the divers caught her foot on a hose and felt heavily, landing on 
her right knee and hand, and hitting her face on the steel 
decking.  The Coastguard was alerted and, once ashore, the 
diver was taken by ambulance to hospital.  She was treated for a 
fractured right wrist, a broken nose and various cuts and bruises. 
September 2007 07/266 
Two pairs of divers conducted a drift dive in a maximum depth of 
28m.  One of the divers had forgotten his ankle weights and, 
whilst trying to deploy a delayed SMB, he became inverted.  Both 
his fins came off and he was not able to right himself.  His buddy 
attempted to assist him but he remained inverted.  The other pair 
of divers passed close and saw that there was a problem.  One 
of these divers came to assist and found that the inverted diver 
was unresponsive, apparently unconscious.  The inverted diver's 
mask was flooded but he retained his regulator, although, as he 
was inverted, he was struggling to get enough air and it is 
thought that he swallowed water.  The assisting diver from the 
other pair managed to right the troubled diver and he brought 
him to the surface using a controlled buoyant lift.  The troubled 
diver's buddy surfaced with them and the rescuing diver's buddy 
deployed a delayed SMB and made her own ascent.  At the 
surface the rescuing diver gave a distress signal and the 
troubled diver was recovered into the boat.  His total dive 
duration was 9 min.  He was placed on oxygen and the 
Coastguard was alerted.  The casualty, his buddy and the 
rescuer were airlifted to hospital.  The casualty was given a 
number of tests and released later that evening. 
September 2007 07/367 
Two divers dived to 40m.  One of the divers panicked and made 
for the surface; his buddy followed.  At the surface the panicked 
diver was found to have blueness of the lips, froth coming from 
his mouth, he had breathing difficulties and he was 
semiconscious.  Their dive duration was 7 min.  They were 
recovered from the water and the panicked diver was placed on 
oxygen.  The diver had swallowed a lot of water.  His buddy 
developed a headache.  The Coastguard was alerted and the 
divers were taken by helicopter and ambulance to hospital.  
(Coastguard report). 
September 2007 07/249 
Two divers conducted a 43 min dive to a maximum depth of 28m 
with a 3 min safety stop at 5m.  3 hours 30 min later they dived 
to 20m for 43 min with a 3 min safety stop.  An hour after this 
dive one of the pair started to feel unwell and was sick.  He was 
placed on oxygen and the emergency services were alerted.  
The diver was taken to hospital for tests.

Boating & Surface Incidents 
 
 
October 2006  07/233 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 31m.  
They deployed a delayed SMB, from a depth of 28m, to make 
their ascent.  They were conducting decompression stops at a 
depth of 6m when their boat ran over the SMB, pulling the line.  
The diver released line and then wound it in again as the boat 
moved away.  8 min later the boat again ran over the SMB; this 
time it caught on the boat's ladder and the diver was forced to 
let go of the reel.  The divers were safely recovered into the 
boat. 
October 2006 07/273

Three divers entered the water from an RHIB.  The single crew 
in the RHIB realised that the boat was drifting away from the 
divers' SMB and she attempted to start the engine.  She 
repeatedly pulled on the start cord but the engine would not 
start.  During these attempts she lost her glasses overboard.  
She became panicked and was unable to use the radio.  She 
attracted the attention of a passing yacht by waving a flag.  
They came to her aid.  They alerted the Coastguard and a 
helicopter and two lifeboats were tasked to assist.  The yacht 
took the RHIB in tow and then recovered the divers who had 
been located by the helicopter.  The yacht then brought boat 
and divers safely to the shore.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2007 07/095 
A dive boat placed five pairs of divers on a wreck in a maximum 
depth of 24m.  Their plan was to spend some time on the wreck 
and then to drift off the wreck for the rest of the dive.  The divers 
planned to deploy delayed SMBs when they started the drift.  A 
diver from one pair abandoned his dive during the descent as 
he was concerned about his weighting.  He left the water and 
reported that his buddy had continued his descent to join 
another pair that had descended before him.  Unknown to those 
at the surface this diver failed to find the other pair and 
continued his dive alone.  The surface party were now 
expecting to see four delayed SMBs.  They followed the four 
SMBs but as the divers surfaced they discovered that one SMB 
had a single diver under it, not the expected trio.  The missing 
pair could not be seen.  The Coastguard was alerted and a 
helicopter was tasked to search.  The boat recovered the divers 
and continued down stream.  The missing pair were then 
spotted and safely recovered.  They had been at the surface for 
about 30 min.  They had deployed a delayed SMB but it had not 
inflated correctly and was not spotted by the boat.  (Coastguard 
report). 
May 2007 07/187 
A dive boat dropped a pair of divers in the water.  The divers 
were carrying an SMB.  19 min later a second pair entered the 
water to carry out training drills.  First they practiced lifting the 
shot and then controlled buoyant lift drills.  While recovering the 
shot, the boat crew lost sight of the first pair's SMB.  They 
recovered the second pair of divers and a surface search was 
initiated involving other boats.  The dive boat's radio was faulty 
and they could not transmit.  Another craft alerted the 
Coastguard.  The lost divers managed to attract the attention of 
a passing yacht which in turn directed the rescue craft to them.  
No subsequent ill effects were reported.

Filling restrictions at a fuel station prevented the auxiliary tank 
of an RHIB from being fully filled.  The cox felt that there was 
enough fuel for the planned dive.  However, one diver later 
became seasick resulting in the divers diving in three waves 
rather than the planned two.  The divers also spent some time 
searching for a lost shotline.  When they started their final return 
journey the sea state worsened and they had to travel against 
wind and tide.  The slave tank ran out during the return journey 
and the main tank also ran dry when they were 0.5 miles from 
the harbour.  They anchored the boat and alerted the 
Coastguard.  A lifeboat was tasked to bring them to the shore.

August 2007 07/173 
Two rebreather divers conducted a dive on a wreck in a 
maximum depth of 30m.  They were the last pair from the boat 
so, at the beginning of the dive, they sent the shotweight to the 
surface.  There was a current running over the site.  To make 
their ascent they both deployed delayed SMBs.  Their ascent 
took 17 min and they arrived at the surface with a total duration 
of 52 min.  At the surface they could not see their boat.  After 
some delay the boat party alerted the Coastguard and a search 
was initiated involving a helicopter, three lifeboats and other 
craft.  The divers could see the searching helicopter but it was 
at least a mile from their position.  They also saw lifeboats and 
other craft but they could not attract their attention using SMBs, 
whistles and torches,  The divers roped themselves together, 
dropped their weights and attempted to swim to the shore which 
was 3 miles away.  They were finally located 5 hours and 20 
min after surfacing by a fishing vessel,  The fishermen had 
heard the reports on the radio, plotted where they thought the 
divers would be and found them within 500m of their estimated 
position.  The divers were recovered into the fishing vessel, 
transferred into a lifeboat and brought ashore.  Neither diver 
suffered any subsequent ill effects. 
August 2007 07/320 
A group of divers were diving in a channel leading to a port.  
They had deployed a delayed SMB and were surfacing when a 
ferry passed over the top of them.  Their dive boat was in 
attendance and was displaying flag Alpha.  The Coastguard and 
the harbour control were alerted.  The port control had no 
knowledge of the divers' activities and the divers did not have 
permission to dive there.  No injuries resulted.  (Coastguard 
report). 
August 2007 07/362 
The Coastguard was alerted when a dive boat lost battery 
power with six divers in the water.  All divers were safely 
recovered into the dive boat and a lifeboat towed the disabled 
craft back to harbour.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports).

A dive charter boat developed a fuel problem.  All the divers 
had been recovered.  Another charter boat towed the disabled 
boat back to harbour.  Five other vessels from the same 
harbour had fuel problems that day; investigations into the fuel 
supply were being conducted.  (Coastguard report).

breakwater.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
August 2007 07/176 
Three divers entered the water from an RHIB and commenced 
their dive.  The bilge pump in the boat was not working so the 
RHIB was driven round with the transom drainage trunk lowered 
to clear it of water.  Once this was done the boat returned to 
cover the divers.  At this point the engine cut out and would not 
restart.  The Coastguard was alerted and a helicopter, a lifeboat 
and other craft were tasked to assist.  The disabled boat was 
taken in tow by a harbour master's boat and another dive boat.  
The divers were recovered by the lifeboat when they surfaced.  
The helicopter spotted a rope trailing from the back of the RHIB.  
It was then found that a rope from the boat had been washed 
through the trunk when the water was being drained and that 
this had then become wrapped around the propeller preventing 
the engine from being started.  The rope was removed and the 
engine restarted allowing the RHIB to continue under its own 
power. 
August 2007 07/179 
Nine divers in two RHIBs planned a wreck dive.  One boat was 
anchored over the site and the other stood by to recover the 
divers.  All divers entered the water and the last pair to do so 
sent up the shotline.  While the divers were underwater the 
weather conditions worsened with wind strengthening and wave 
height increasing.  When the divers surfaced they had lost 
contact with the boats.  The Coastguard was alerted and a 
helicopter and two lifeboats were tasked to search.  Seven of 
the divers were found within about 15 min and the last two were 
located 20 min later.  All were safely recovered by the lifeboats.

August 2007 07/327 
The Coastguard was alerted when two divers were missing 
from a dive.  A lifeboat and a helicopter were tasked to assist.  
The divers were found by their own party before the emergency 
services arrived.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
August 2007 07/207 
The Coastguard was alerted when a dive boat suffered an 
engine failure.  A nearby sailing vessel assisted and the engine 
was restarted.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2007 07/330 
A dive RHIB suffered engine failure.  A yacht took them in tow 
then contacted the Coastguard for assistance.  The yacht's draft 
prevented them from bringing the RHIB to its launch point and a 
failure of the lifeboat's launch equipment delayed its departure.  
Another dive boat brought the disabled craft to shore.  
(Coastguard report). 
 
August 2007 07/422 
Lifeboat assisted in the search for missing diver(s).  (RNLI 
report). 
September 2007 07/214 
The Coastguard was alerted when a diver became overdue 
from a wreck dive.  A search was initiated involving two 
lifeboats, a helicopter, two military vessels and associated 
aircraft, and other craft that were in the area.  The diver was 
located safe and well 2 hours 30 min after he had entered the 
water, 2.5 nautical miles from his entry point.  (Coastguard 
report). 
September 2007 07/216 
An RHIB contacted the Coastguard when two divers were 
overdue from a drift dive.  Neither diver had deployed an SMB 
and their dive was 10 min longer than planned.  When they 
surfaced they could not see their boat.  A search was 
conducted involving two lifeboats, a helicopter and other 
vessels.  The divers were located by the helicopter and safely 
recovered into their boat.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2007 07/332 
The Coastguard was alerted when a diver was seen holding on 
to a pot marker.  A lifeboat was tasked to assist.  The diver was 
recovered and his two buddies were found safely ashore.  
(Coastguard report). 
September 2007 07/222 
Three divers entered the water, descended to about 20m and 
began to drift with a current.  One of the pair sent up a delayed 
SMB and heard the boat's engine start, indicating to him that 
the boat was following.  After 20 min the current had picked up 
significantly and they had reached their agreed maximum depth 
of 30m.  The dive leader signalled the ascent and they started 
upwards.  They were then caught in a series of down-currents 
and were pulled down to 39m.  They put air in their BCDs and 
finned upwards.  They were then caught in up-currents and 
started to ascend rapidly.  One of the three required stops at 
20m, the other two were caught in an up-current and were 
forced to leave him.  They reached the surface after 32 min, 2 
min longer than their planned dive duration.  At the surface the 
two divers saw the third diver surface about 0.5 miles away 
from them.  The divers inflated their BCDs and waited for pick 
up.  The current carried them away from the boat.  They 
attached their weightbelts to a large lifting bag to increase their 
visibility and clipped themselves together.  The boat located 
and recovered the third diver but could not locate the other two.  
Bright sunlight made it more difficult for those in the boat to see 
the two missing divers, although the divers could see the boat.  
The divers blew compressed air powered whistles but to no 
avail.  The boat crew alerted the Coastguard as soon as they 
realised that two were missing.  A search was conducted 
involving three lifeboats, three helicopters, two oil tankers, a 
ferry and many other vessels.  As darkness approached the lost 
divers dumped their weights and cylinders and switched on a 
torch and a strobe light.  After they had been in the water for 9 
hours 15 min a helicopter spotted the strobe and the divers 
were airlifted to hospital from where they were later released. 
September 2007 07/335 
A lifeboat was launched to assist three shore divers who were

being swept away by a current.  All three were safely recovered.  
(Coastguard report). 
 
 
September 2007 07/253 
The skipper of a dive boat alerted the Coastguard by mobile 
phone when four divers were not seen after a dive.  Whilst the 
divers had been underwater the sea conditions had deteriorated 
making it hard for them to be seen.  A helicopter and another 
dive boat assisted in the search.  The other dive boat recovered 
two of the divers and located the other two on the shore.  The 
divers on the shore were picked up by the helicopter and all 
divers were safely returned to their boat. 
September 2007 07/244 
The skipper of an RHIB lost sight of his divers' SMBs in 
deteriorating weather conditions.  He commenced a call to the 
Coastguard but a nearby lifeboat radioed him to tell him that his 
divers were in the entrance of a harbour from where a ferry was 
about to leave.  There was some confusion between the RHIB 
crew and the lifeboat.  The RHIB went to recover the divers but 
could not find them because they had been picked up by the 
lifeboat.  All were safely returned to the shore. 
September 2007 07/337 
A dive boat with two divers in the water suffered engine failure.  
The Coastguard was alerted and two lifeboats were tasked to 
assist.  The dive boat managed to restart its engines before the 
lifeboats arrived and they recovered their divers.  (Coastguard 
report). 
September 2007 07/242 
The Coastguard was alerted when a group of three divers 
became overdue after a drift dive.  The dive boat had lost sight 
of their SMB and had conducted a brief search.  The divers had 
been spotted on the surface by an observer on a nearby cliff top 
and the Coastguard was able to direct the boat to the missing 
divers who were safely recovered.  (Coastguard report).

Ascents 
 
 
October 2006  07/270 
Rescue Helicopter R-131 airlifted a diving casualty from a dive 
vessel following a dive to 30m.  The diver had made a rapid 
ascent from depth missing 7 min of stops, the casualty was 
medi linked to a diving doctor prior to evacuation.  Seahouses 
lifeboat also attended the scene.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
October 2006 07/276 
Two divers were airlifted from a diving vessel following a dive to 
21m, the dive went well until the ascent when buoyancy 
problems were experienced whilst deploying the delayed SMB, 
and the helicopter was met at the HLS by Poole Coastguard 
team.  (Coastguard report). 
November 2006 07/279 
Two divers made a rapid ascent after becoming entangled in 
fishing nets, the divers were medi linked with the DDRC, the 
duty doctor advised that no medical assistance was required.  
(Coastguard report). 
November 2006 07/012 
Two divers conducted a no stop dive to a depth of 24m in very 
poor underwater visibility.  They deployed a delayed SMB to 
make their ascent.  Due to the poor light condition they 
struggled to read their computers as they ascended.  At about 
13m both divers started to become concerned that the light 
level was not increasing.  They lost buoyancy control and made 
a rapid ascent to the surface.  Their dive duration was 35 min.  
They were recovered into the boat and placed on oxygen.  
Once ashore they went to hospital and spent another 4 hours 
on oxygen.  Neither developed any symptoms of DCI and no 
further action was taken. 
November 2006 07/013 
A diver was engaged in a deep diving training course at a depth 
of 34m.  He was close to an underwater structure and his 
delayed SMB became caught on part of it.  He panicked and 
rushed for the surface.  His dive duration was 12 min.  His 
instructor followed and raised the alarm at the surface.  The 
diver was recovered into a boat and brought ashore.  He was 
placed on oxygen and an ambulance was called.  However, no 
symptoms of DCI were experienced and no further action was 
taken. 
November 2006 07/014 
A diver had just finished a drysuit training course and undertook 
his first non-training dive.  At a depth of 18m he lost control of 
his buoyancy and made a rapid ascent to the surface.  His dive 
duration was 20 min.  He was placed on oxygen.  No adverse 
effects were experienced. 
December 2006 07/015 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 20m.  One 
of the divers was filling her delayed SMB when her regulator 
began to free flow and she was not able to stop it.  She tried to 
deploy her pony regulator but made an uncontrolled ascent to 
the surface before she could use it.  Her dive duration was 13 
min.  She was placed on oxygen.  No subsequent adverse 
effects were experienced. 
 
December 2006 07/052 
Two divers descended a shotline to a wreck.  One of the pair 
lost control of her buoyancy and ascended rapidly from 17m to 
the surface.  She arrived at the surface feet first and lay 
motionless, face up.  She was recovered into the boat.  She 
was unresponsive and was placed on oxygen.  The diver's 
buddy surfaced 2 min later.  The Coastguard was alerted and 
diving medical advice was sought.  After about 3 min the diver 
began to respond and soon recovered.  Once ashore the diver 
was taken to hospital where no problems were found.  The diver 
had been wearing an undersuit under a neoprene drysuit and 
had developed buoyancy problems. 
January 2007 07/282 
The Coastguard was alerted when a diver made a rapid ascent 
from 30m after a dive to a maximum depth of 56m.  The diver 
was airlifted to hospital.  (Coastguard report). 
February 2007 07/023 
A diver conducted a 25 min dive to a depth of 22m with a 4 min 
stop at 6m.  1 hour 15 min later he dived to 28m.  At this depth 
his regulator began to free flow and he made a rapid ascent to 
the surface.  His dive duration was 4 min. He was placed on 
oxygen.  No subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
February 2007 07/024 
Two divers were engaged in a deep diving course.  At a depth 
of 28m one of the divers lost a fin and began to panic.  She 
made a rapid ascent to the surface and her buddy followed.  
Their dive duration was 10 min.  Both divers were placed on 
oxygen.  No subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
February 2007 07/028 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 36m.  
They ascended to a depth of 7m.  At this point one of the pair 
was unable to vent air from his drysuit.  He made a fast ascent 
to the surface.  His dive duration was 34 min.  He was placed 
on oxygen but suffered no subsequent ill effects. 
February 2007 07/036 
The Coastguard was alerted when a diver lost consciousness in 
a boat.  The diver and her buddy were airlifted to a hospital and 
then transported to a recompression facility for treatment.  
(Coastguard report). 
February 2007 07/033 
Two divers descended to a depth of 20m at which point the 
regulator of one of the divers began to free flow.  The diver's 
buddy started to lift him using a controlled buoyant lift.  The 
diver with the free flow used his buddy's octopus regulator.  
Their vision was obscured by a lot of bubbles and they 
ascended quickly to 12m.  Both divers dumped buoyancy and 
they then descended back down to 25m.  At this point they 
regained buoyancy and they rose directly to the surface.  Their 
total dive duration was 7 min.  They swam to the shore and left 
the water.  No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
March 2007 07/283 
Two divers dived to a maximum depth of 30m.  One made a 
rapid ascent from 25m and the other from 15m.  The divers 
were placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  The

divers developed no symptoms but they were airlifted to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
March 2007 07/124 
Two divers descended a shotline to a wreck in a depth of 24m.  
They exchanged OK signals and moved off the shotline.  One of 
the divers then developed a buoyancy problem, became 
inverted and ascended rapidly to the surface.  His buddy 
surfaced shortly afterwards.  His dive duration was 3 min.  He 
was placed on oxygen and then nitrox.  He developed no 
symptoms and no further action was taken.  He was using a 
new undersuit and subsequently planned to use straps to 
prevent air migrating into the feet of his drysuit. 
April 2007 07/287 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 32m.  At the 
end of the dive he made a rapid ascent to the surface.  His dive 
duration was 20 min.  He complained of dizziness.  He was 
placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  He was 
taken by lifeboat to a recompression facility and from there to a 
hospital.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
April 2007 07/087 
A diver ran out of air during a dive to 32m.  He made a rapid 
ascent to the surface missing 12 min of decompression stops.  
He was using nitrox 32 and his dive duration was 60 min.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and he was placed on oxygen.  The 
boat returned to shore and the diver was taken by ambulance to 
a recompression facility for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
April 2007 07/289 
A diver using nitrox 27 conducted a 30 min dive to a maximum 
depth of 40m.  At the end of the dive he made a rapid ascent to 
the surface missing 6 min of stops.  On surfacing the diver felt 
very sick, vomited and coughed.  The Coastguard was alerted 
and diving medical advice sought.  The boat returned to shore 
and the diver was taken by ambulance to hospital.  (Coastguard 
report). 
April 2007 07/088 
A diver conducted a dive to 21m for 40 min using a twin cylinder 
set.  Approximately 1 hour later he dived to 16m for 40 min.  At 
the end of the dive he attempted to deploy a delayed SMB but 
the reel jammed so he let it go.  One of his two buddies then 
deployed their SMB and they started to ascend.  The cylinders 
of the diver with the twin-set were now nearly empty, after two 
dives, and he was unable to control his buoyancy.  He made a 
rapid ascent to the surface despite attempting to dump air.  This 
was the first time that he had used this system in salt water and 
he was not carrying enough weight.  The Coastguard was 
alerted and he was airlifted to a recompression facility for 
treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
April 2007 07/066 
Two divers were participating in a training course in a larger 
group of divers.  One was engaged in drysuit training and the 
other was undergoing nitrox training.  The drysuit trainee 
descended to a depth of 36m and the other diver to a slightly 
shallower depth.  During their ascent, at a depth of 10m, they 
lost control of their buoyancy and made rapid ascents to the 
surface.  Their dive duration was 21 min.  Both were placed on 
oxygen but no subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
April 2007 07/089 
A diver descended a shotline to a wreck at a depth of 13m.  He 
had been on the wreck for 2 min when his weightbelt fell off.  He 
tried to grab hold of the wreck but was unable to do so and he 
made a rapid ascent to the surface.  His dive duration was 35 
min.  At the surface he was recovered into a boat and the 
Coastguard was alerted.  The diver was airlifted to a 
recompression facility for treatment.  The weightbelt was found 
by another group and the buckle was fastened;  the belt must 
therefore have slid off.  (Coastguard report). 
April 2007 07/067 
Two divers planned a dive to allow one of them to gain 
experience with her new drysuit.  They planned to check at 6m 
and 25m if the diver was comfortable to continue and, if so, they 
would descend to a maximum depth of 35m.  The dive 
proceeded without problems and they descended to 35m.  At 
this point the diver with the new drysuit began to feel very 
anxious and a little panicked.  At this point the troubled diver 
had 90 bar and her buddy had 140 bar.  The buddy signalled a 
direct ascent to the surface but the troubled diver indicated that 
she wanted to follow the sloping bottom back up to the surface.  
They started to swim back.  At 20m the troubled diver had only 
30 bar remaining.  The buddy gave the troubled diver his pony 
regulator and used a controlled buoyant lift to bring them to the 
surface.  At 6m the ascent became too rapid and the buddy 
dumped some air.  They sank back down to 9m and then rose 
to 6m again.  They then made a rapid ascent to the surface 
missing an indicated 2 min of decompression stops.  Both 
divers were placed on oxygen but no subsequent ill effects were 
experienced.  Narcosis was thought to have contributed to their 
problems at depth. 
April 2007 07/069 
Two divers made a dive to a depth of 20m.  At this point one of 
the pair felt that her air tasted bad.  She told her buddy of the 
problem by writing on her slate.  Her buddy tasted her air and 
agreed that it was not right.  She switched to her buddy's 
alternative air supply and they started to ascend.  At 9m a 
lanyard started to pull the alternative air supply from the diver's 
mouth and she received a water-air mix.  They made a fast 
ascent to the surface and raised the alarm.  Their dive duration 
was 10 min.  The troubled diver complained of a tightness in 
her chest, she was placed on oxygen and an ambulance was 
called.  Medical checks indicated no significant problems and 
she was not taken to hospital.  The air cylinder was retained for 
air quality checks. 
April 2007 07/070 
Two divers dived to a maximum depth of 22m.  Towards the 
end of the dive they deployed a delayed SMB from a depth of 
20m.  They then realised that one of the pair was down to 50 
bar.  They started to ascend an underwater cliff face but, at 
10m, the diver who was low on air started to sink back down.  
The buddy managed to get them both to the surface but there 
was insufficient air to inflate the troubled diver's BCD.  The 
buddy just managed to keep the diver at the surface until a boat 
arrived to assist.  Once in the boat the troubled diver was in 
panic and took some time to calm down.  He was placed on 
oxygen.  No subsequent ill effects were experienced.  The 
troubled diver retained his weightbelt throughout. 
April 2007 07/092 
A pair of divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 30m.  
During the ascent one of the pair rose rapidly to the surface 
from 10m.  He was placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was 
alerted.  The party returned to the shore.  Medical advice was 
sought but no further action was deemed necessary.  
(Coastguard report). 
April 2007 07/184

Two divers conducted a dive to a wreck in a maximum depth of 
30m.  During the ascent one of the pair lost control of his 
buoyancy and made an uncontrolled ascent from 20m to the 
surface.  His buddy followed at a more normal rate.  When the 
buddy surfaced he gave a distress signal and supported the 
buoyant diver.  They were recovered into the boat and the diver 
who had made the buoyant ascent was placed on oxygen and 
given fluids.  The Coastguard was alerted and the boat returned 
to harbour, having arranged for another boat on the site to 
collect their remaining divers.  The diver developed a slight 'pins 
and needles' in his hand but this subsided once his drysuit wrist 
seal was released.  The diver and his buddy were transported 
by ambulance to a recompression facility.  Neither developed 
symptoms of DCI but the buoyant diver was given a 
precautionary recompression treatment. 
April 2007 07/097 
The Coastguard was alerted when a diver made a rapid ascent 
from 30m.  His dive duration was 23 min.  He was airlifted to a 
recompression facility.  (Coastguard report). 
April 2007 07/296 
The Coastguard was alerted when two divers made a rapid 
ascent from 41m.  Diving medical advice was sought and the 
divers were taken to hospital for observation.  (Coastguard 
report). 
April 2007 07/295 
A diver became tangled in his SMB line and made a rapid 
ascent to the surface.  He was placed on oxygen and the 
Coastguard was alerted.  Diving medical advice was sought 
and the diver was airlifted to a recompression facility.  
(Coastguard report). 
April 2007 07/079 
Two divers conducted a dive to a wreck in a maximum depth of 
28m.  The underwater visibility was low and it was dark.  With 6 
min of no stop time remaining one of the pair deployed a 
delayed SMB.  His buddy then signalled that the diver's octopus 
regulator was free flowing.  He tried to stop it but could not do 
so.  He became disorientated in a mass of bubbles.  He 
realised that he was ascending and tried to slow himself down.  
He rose to the surface and summoned help from the boat.  His 
dive duration was 23 min.  He was recovered into the boat, laid 
down and was placed on oxygen.  His buddy made a normal 
ascent, including a safety stop.  The Coastguard was alerted 
and the boat returned to shore.  Once ashore the group were 
met by the Coastguard and the diver was airlifted to a 
recompression facility.  No symptoms were found but he was 
given precautionary recompression treatment. 
May 2007 07/185 
An instructor and two trainees dived to a maximum depth of 
13m.  During the ascent, at a depth of 12m, the instructor 
noticed that the weightbelt of one of the trainees was slipping 
loose.  He held onto the weightbelt and signalled that the 
trainee should adopt a horizontal position so that he could 
refasten the belt.  Whilst attempting to do this all three rose to 
the surface at a faster than normal rate.  Their dive duration 
was 24 min.  No symptoms developed and no further action 
was taken. 
May 2007 07/101 
Two divers were diving at a depth of 21m when one of the pair 
experienced a free flow from his regulator.  During his ascent he 
lost control of his buoyancy and made a rapid ascent to the 
surface.  His dive duration was 8 min.  He was placed on 
oxygen.  No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
May 2007 07/298 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 11m.  After 
about 8 min she lost her weightbelt and made a rapid ascent to 
the surface.  She developed a slight 'pins and needles' in her 
toes.  The Coastguard was alerted and the diver was airlifted to 
a recompression facility and then taken from there to hospital.  
(Coastguard report). 
May 2007 07/103 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 21m.  
During their ascent they deployed a delayed SMB at a depth of 
14m and then rose to a depth of 6m to carry out a 3 min safety 
stop.  At 6m, one of the pair was unable to release air from his 
cuff dump and he ascended rapidly to the surface.  He could 
see his buddy below and signalled that he was OK.  His buddy 
completed the stop and ascended normally.  No subsequent ill 
effects were experienced. 
May 2007 07/299 
The Coastguard was alerted when a diver surfaced having 
missed 7 min of decompression stops.  An ambulance was 
tasked to assist but then stood down when it became clear that 
the diver was not developing symptoms.  Later the diver went to 
hospital for a check-up but no problems were found.  
(Coastguard report). 
May 2007 07/105 
Two divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 
27m.  They gradually ascended to 20m where they spent most 
of the dive.  After about 20 min one of the pair developed 
leakage problems with his mask and she tried a few times to 
clear it.  Then she signalled that all was not well and that she 
wanted to ascend.  Her buddy deployed a delayed SMB and 
they started to ascend.  At 7m the troubled diver could no 
longer dump air from her drysuit and she ascended directly to 
the surface missing a planned 3 min safety stop.  Her dive 
duration was 28 min.  No subsequent ill effects were 
experienced. 
May 2007 07/081 
A trainee diver conducted a 22 min dive to 19m.  Later that day 
she dived to 18m.  Early in the dive she panicked and made a 
rapid ascent to the surface.  Her dive duration was 6 min.  She 
was recovered from the water and placed on oxygen.  She 
slowly recovered and within 1 hour was back to normal. 
May 2007 07/093 
A diver conducted a dive to 22m for 30 min.  Later that day he 
dived to 17m for 26 min.  He made a rapid ascent from this 
second dive and showed signs of DCI.  He was airlifted to shore 
and examined by a diving doctor.  He was not found to require 
recompression treatment.  These dives were his first this year in 
salt water and he was underweighted.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2007 07/188 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 17m.  
About 28 min into the dive one of the pair developed buoyancy 
problems with air migrating into the feet of her drysuit.  She was 
about 3m above her buddy and attempted to dump air and swim 
back down.  The divers lost contact with each other and the 
buoyant diver ascended directly to the surface, arriving feet first.  
She was recovered into the boat and placed on oxygen.  Her 
dive duration was about 32 min.  Her buddy surfaced normally.  
The Coastguard was alerted and medical advice was sought.

The boat returned to shore.  No symptoms developed and no 
further action was required. 
May 2007 07/300 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 50m.  One 
of the pair missed stops at 15, 12, 9 and 6m.  The second diver 
missed stops at 3m.  The Coastguard was alerted and the 
divers were airlifted to a recompression facility.  (Coastguard 
report). 
May 2007 07/085 
Two divers conducted a dive to a depth of 30m.  At this depth 
the regulator of one of the pair began to free flow.  They made a 
faster than normal ascent to the surface.  Their dive duration 
was 5 min.  Both were placed on oxygen.  No subsequent ill 
effects were reported. 
May 2007 07/189 
An instructor and two trainees dived to a maximum depth of 
14m.  They left the bottom after 22 min to practice delayed SMB 
deployment.  One trainee lost control of his buoyancy while 
doing this and rose rapidly to the surface.  The other trainee 
also rose upwards while deploying the SMB but he managed to 
stop himself at about 5m.  He re-descended to 8m and then 
ascended normally with the instructor making a 3 min stop at 
6m as planned.

The Coastguard was alerted when a diver made a rapid ascent 
from 20m.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2007 07/115 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 28m.  At a 
depth of about 5m they are thought to have been practicing 
rescue skills. One diver inflated the other's drysuit instead of his 
BCD and this caused the diver to make an inverted ascent to 
the surface with his feet out of his drysuit boots.  The divers left 
the water and were given oxygen.  No subsequent ill effects 
were reported. 
June 2007 07/311 
The Coastguard was alerted after a diver surfaced having made 
a rapid ascent from 18m.  The diver was placed on oxygen and 
landed ashore.  Diving medical advice was sought.  
(Coastguard report). 
June 2007 07/302 
A diver conducted a dive to a depth of 43m.  During his ascent 
he lost control of his buoyancy and failed to conduct 
decompression stops.  The Coastguard was alerted and diving 
medical advice was sought.  The diver was placed on oxygen 
and taken to hospital for observation.  The diver discharged 
himself later that day.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2007 07/111 
A pair of divers completed a dive to a depth of 31m.  They 
planned to decompress using a shared cylinder.  One of the 
pair had a new mask which was very tight and it prevented her 
from inserting the mouthpiece of the decompression regulator 
into her mouth.  She started to swallow water.  She replaced 
her main regulator but, whilst doing so, she ascended to the 
surface with her buddy, missing a 4 min stop.  Their dive 
duration was 28 min.  The Coastguard was alerted and medical 
advice was sought.  The divers were monitored and no further 
action was reported. 
 
June 2007 07/205 
Three divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 
30m.  Prior to the dive they had not discussed their dive plan 
nor agreed a dive leader.  20 min into the dive one of the three 
noticed that his computer was approaching the end of the no 
stop time and he signalled this to the other two.  The signal was 
acknowledged but no action was taken.  The diver ascended to 
25m.  He continued to try to attract the attention of the other 
divers but received no response.  After a total of 40 min they 
deployed a delayed SMB and made an ascent.  All three 
stopped for 4 min at 6m.  At this point one diver had only 20 bar 
remaining and the other two 50 bar.  The group surfaced with a 
total dive duration of 52 min.  All of their computers indicated 
missed stops.  All three were placed on oxygen and the 
Coastguard was alerted.  A helicopter attended and the boat 
took the divers ashore.  The divers were taken by ambulance to 
a recompression facility where they were given precautionary 
treatment.  No adverse effects were experienced.  One of the 
divers was not aware of the meaning of the decompression 
warnings given by his computer. 
June 2007 07/120 
The Coastguard was alerted when a diver made a rapid ascent 
from 20m.  The dive boat was met by the Coastguard and a 
diving doctor when it reached shore.  No emergency actions 
were considered necessary; the diver was advised to go to a 
hospital A&E department for a check up.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2007 07/304 
A diver conducted a dive to a depth of 12m.  3 min into the dive 
she panicked and made a rapid ascent to the surface.  The 
diver complained of feeling weak, tingling in her fingers and 
pain in her legs.  The diver was placed on oxygen and the 
Coastguard was alerted.  The diver was airlifted to a 
recompression facility.  It is reported that the diver had been 
drinking heavily the previous night and had gone to bed late.  
(Coastguard report). 
June 2007 07/346 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 42m.  The 
diver ran out of air and ascended rapidly to the surface missing 
all decompression stops.  His total dive time was 33 min.  He 
had a slight headache.  He was placed on oxygen and the 
Coastguard was alerted.  Diving medical advice was sought.  
The diver was brought ashore and taken by ambulance to a 
recompression facility.  It is reported that he switched to nitrox 
70 on the bottom before surfacing.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2007 07/130 
Two divers were at a depth of 19m.  One of the pair put air into 
her BCD, however the valve appeared to stick in the 'on' 
position and air continued to flow.  Her buddy disconnected the 
hose which continued to free flow.  He gave the diver his 
alternative air source and turned her air off.  They started to 
ascend.  At about 11m the alternate air source, which was still 
clipped to the donor diver, was pulled to one side and out of the 
diver's mouth.  The buddy gave her his other alternative air 
source which was attached to his pony cylinder.   However the 
exhaust valve of this regulator had become unseated and it 
provided an air-water mixture.  During this time they sank back 
down to 19m.  The diver then switched back to the first 
alternative air source and they started to ascend again.  At 
about 11m the ascent became rapid.  At the surface the buddy 
raised the alarm.  He struggled to keep the diver at the surface 
and dropped her weightbelt.  Once out of the water the diver 
was given oxygen.  No subsequent ill effects were reported.

A diver was brought ashore by lifeboat after surfacing too 
quickly.  He was taken to a recompression facility for treatment.  
(Media report). 
June 2007 07/126 
A pair of divers conducted a dive to a depth of 36m.  They 
deployed a delayed SMB to make their ascent.  One of the pair 
developed cramp at this point and this delayed them.  They 
made a very slow ascent and this added to their decompression 
requirement.  When they reached the surface their computers 
were indicating that they had missed 2 min of decompression 
stops.  They were placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was 
alerted.  Medical advice was sought.  The divers were 
monitored and no further action was required.  (Coastguard 
report). 
June 2007 07/351 
A diver surfaced from a dive to 24m missing decompression 
stops.  His dive duration was 20 min.  The Coastguard was 
alerted and diving medical advice was sought.  The diver was 
airlifted to hospital.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2007 07/206 
A pair of divers descended a shotline to a wreck at a maximum 
depth of 34m.  One of the pair had a new delayed SMB and 
wanted to practice deploying it at the end of the dive.  The 
divers ascended to a higher part of the wreck to make their 
ascent and the diver with the new SMB started to deploy it.  At 
this point he developed buoyancy problems with air migrating 
into the feet of his drysuit.  He hung onto the wreck and 
struggled to right himself.  The other diver took the reel and 
deployed the SMB.  The buoyant diver managed to get the right 
way up and dumped all the air from his BCD.  He tried to dump 
air from his suit but he still remained very buoyant.  He realised 
that he would not be able to hold depth at a stop and he looked 
around for the shotline.  He could not see the shotline and, as 
his decompression requirements were mounting, he decided to 
ascend as slowly as he could.  He made a rapid, buoyant 
ascent to the surface missing 14 min of decompression stops.  
He was placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  His 
buddy made a normal ascent including 17 min of 
decompression; his dive duration was 56 min.  The buoyant 
diver was airlifted to a recompression facility.  He developed no 
symptoms of DCI but was given precautionary treatment.  It was 
subsequently concluded that his undersuit had blocked his 
drysuit dump valve thus preventing him from controlling his 
buoyancy. 
June 2007 07/309 
Two divers made a rapid ascent from 30m missing a total of 6 
min of stops.  The Coastguard was alerted and the divers were 
airlifted to a recompression facility.  They showed no signs of 
DCI.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2007 07/140 
Three divers were conducting a dive to a maximum depth of 
28m.  They became disorientated and started to ascend to an 
area with a depth of 22m.  One of the divers then lost his mask.  
The three divers then made a rapid ascent to the surface.  Once 
out of the water they were placed on oxygen and diving medical 
advice was sought.  They were monitored for signs of DCI.  No 
subsequent ill effects were reported. 
July 2007 07/149 
An instructor and two trainees conducted a dive to a depth of 
14m.  Towards the end of the dive one of the trainees lost 
control of his buoyancy and surfaced without any stops.  The 
instructor and other trainee could see that he was safely at the 
surface and they completed a 3 min safety stop.  The lone diver 
was seen at the surface by others and the alarm was raised.  
No subsequent related ill effects were experienced. 
July 2007 07/150 
The Coastguard was alerted when a diver made a rapid ascent 
from 22m.  Medical advice was sought and the diver was kept 
under observation.  No symptoms developed and no further 
action was reported.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2007 07/142 
Two nitrox divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth 
of 28m.  To make their ascent they deployed a delayed SMB 
from a depth of 20m.  At 17m the ascent became fast and, 
despite dumping air from their drysuits they made a rapid 
ascent to the surface without any stops.  Their dive duration 
was 22 min.  The divers were placed on oxygen.  They did not 
develop any symptoms of DCI but reported to a recompression 
facility for a check up.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2007 07/099 
A trainee diver was leading an instructor on a training dive with 
a second instructor observing.  They dived to a depth of 16m.  
As planned, after 6 min, the trainee indicated that they should 
ascend and that they should make a simulated 1 min stop at 
9m.  The trainee inflated a delayed SMB with planned 
assistance from the instructor.  As they started to ascend the 
trainee knocked her own mouthpiece out whilst trying to wind in 
the SMB line.  She immediately replaced it but she had 
swallowed some water.  She started to panic and indicated that 
she wanted to ascend.  The instructor tried to calm her but she 
was breathing heavily and her panic grew.  She then fully 
inflated her BCD.  The instructor and the observer attempted to 
slow the ascent but they rose rapidly to the surface.  At the 
surface the trainee continued to panic.  She was removed from 
the water, and together with the instructor, was placed on 
oxygen.   No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
July 2007 07/269 
Three divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 
35m.  One of the three had felt a little seasick prior to the dive, 
but a lot better just before they entered the water.  About 12 min 
into the dive this diver indicated that she did not feel right and 
that she wanted to ascend.  The divers had attached a line to 
the bottom of the shotline and as they turned to move back to 
the shot the current carried them quickly towards it.  The diver 
with the reel was unable to wind the line in fast enough and the 
troubled diver became entangled in it.  The dive leader got back 
to the shotline and unclipped the line and the tangled diver and 
the diver with the reel were carried past the shotline.  The dive 
leader let go of the shotline and went with them so that they did 
not become separated from each other.  The troubled diver was 
a little buoyant and, convinced that she was making a fast 
ascent, she dumped air by pulling at her neck and wrist seals.  
The dive leader indicated that they were still on the bottom but 
the troubled diver was still agitated and panicky.  The dive 
leader tried to find the shotline but was unable to, so he 
deployed a delayed SMB and handed the reel to the third diver.  
They were 22 min into the dive when they started their ascent.  
The dive leader ascended with the troubled diver;  the third 
diver was slightly below them reeling in the line.  At 23m the 
troubled diver began to descend again and, at 28m, the dive 
leader helped her to re-ascend.  At 16m the dive leader and the

©BSAC - 2007   31 
troubled diver became tangled in the line but managed to free 
themselves.  The dive leader indicated that the third diver 
should stop reeling in the line and leave the reel; she did this 
and joined the other two.  At 8m, 28 min into the dive, the 
troubled diver began to ascend very quickly; she took hold of 
the third diver and they rose to the surface.  The dive leader 
was also dragged upwards but he managed to control his 
ascent at about 2m.  Concerned about the other two, he too 
surfaced.  The dive leader had missed 8 min of stops, the 
troubled diver 7 min and the third diver 3 min.  At the surface 
they gave the emergency signal and were quickly recovered 
into the boat and placed on oxygen.  The Coastguard was 
alerted and diving medical advice was sought.  Once ashore 
the divers were taken to hospital where they were placed on 
oxygen and subjected to a number of tests.  None of the divers 
displayed any symptoms of DCI and they were later released. 
July 2007 07/354 
The Coastguard was alerted when two divers surfaced missing 
2 min and 3 min of stops respectively.  The divers were placed 
on oxygen and brought ashore.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2007 07/314 
The Coastguard was alerted after a diver made a rapid ascent 
from 34m.  The diver was airlifted to hospital.  (Coastguard 
report). 
July 2007 07/159 
A diver accompanied an instructor and a student on a drift dive 
to a maximum depth of 24m.  During the ascent the 
accompanying diver lost control of his buoyancy and made a 
rapid ascent to the surface from about 15m.  His dive duration 
was 23m.  At the surface he was disorientated.  All three were 
recovered into the boat.  The computer of the diver who had 
made the rapid ascent indicated missed stops.  He was placed 
on oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  The diver was 
airlifted to a recompression facility but did not require treatment. 
August 2007 07/168 
A diver was ascending from a dive to 40m.  Due to a tangle in 
the SMB line the diver surfaced missing 20 min of 
decompression stops.  The Coastguard was alerted and 
medical advice was sought.  The boat returned to shore and the 
diver was advised to see his doctor.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2007 07/323 
A diver conducted a 22 min dive to a maximum depth of 51m.  
During the ascent he became entangled and made a rapid 
ascent to the surface from 6m.  After the dive he experienced 
muscle spasms and the Coastguard was alerted.  Diving 
medical advice was sought.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
August 2007 07/208 
Two divers planned a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 48m.  
They arrived on the seabed at 53m and then ascended to 44m 
where they remained for about 20 min.  Both divers deployed 
delayed SMBs and they started their ascent after about 27 min 
into the dive.  At 15m one of the divers was horizontal and air 
migrated into his drysuit legs.  He was unable to right himself 
and he rose directly to the surface at a slightly faster than 
normal rate, missing all decompression stops.  His dive duration 
was 32 min.  He was recovered into the boat and breathed 
nitrox 80 and then oxygen.  The Coastguard was alerted and 
the diver was airlifted to hospital and from there he was taken 
by ambulance to a recompression facility.  No signs of DCI were 
found but he was given precautionary recompression treatment. 
 
August 2007 07/364 
The Coastguard was alerted when a diver surfaced missing 7 
min of decompression stops.  The diver was placed on oxygen.  
(Coastguard report). 
August 2007 07/324 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 42m.  Towards 
the end of the dive he experienced a regulator problem and 
switched to his pony cylinder.  He then ran out of air and 
surfaced missing 12 min of decompression stops.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and diving medical advice was sought.  
The boat returned to shore and the diver was taken to hospital.  
(Coastguard report). 
August 2007 07/226 
An instructor and two trainees conducted a dive to a maximum 
depth of 19m.  The two trainees were to be assessed on their 
ability to conduct controlled buoyant lifts from 19m to 6m.  Both 
trainees conducted lifts and the three then conducted a 10 min 
drift dive.  The instructor carried the SMB and became aware 
that she was underweighted.  She dumped all the air from her 
suit and BCD.  When the three reached 6m the instructor was 
unable to maintain depth, she gave the SMB to the other two 
and ascended feet first to the surface, but at a normal rate.   
The two trainees conducted a 3 min stop and then surfaced.  
The instructor had changed from a neoprene to a membrane 
drysuit prior to the dive due to a leak in the neoprene suit and 
had not made correct weight adjustments.  No subsequent ill 
effects were experienced. 
August 2007 07/365 
A dive boat contacted the Coastguard when a diver surfaced 
missing 5 min of decompression stops.  The diver was placed 
on oxygen, brought ashore and taken to hospital.  (Coastguard 
report). 
August 2007 07/239 
A diver was diving on a wreck at a maximum depth of 33m.  
About 10 min into the dive the diver made her way up the wreck 
to a depth of about 20m.  At this point she began to feel 
buoyant.  She hung onto the wreck and vented air from her suit 
by curling herself up into a ball.  She took an upright posture 
and dumped all the air; this appeared to be successful as she 
felt suit squeeze.  A little later she became positively buoyant 
again.  She tried to fin back to the wreck but the current was too 
strong and she lost one of her fins trying to swim against it.  She 
dumped as much air as she could but made a rapid ascent to 
the surface.  At the surface she inflated her BCD, dropped her 
weights and gave the distress signal.  She felt breathless.  Back 
in the boat she was placed on oxygen and given water to drink.  
The Coastguard was alerted and the boat returned to shore.  
The diver was taken by ambulance to hospital from where she 
was discharged later in the day with no further action required. 
August 2007 07/212 
Two divers dived to a wreck in a maximum depth of 52m.  They 
could not find the wreck so they aborted the dive.  They 
deployed a delayed SMB at about 30m and this caused a loss 
of buoyancy control.  One of the divers made a rapid ascent; at 
the surface he had a nose bleed but no other symptoms.  His 
buddy made a normal ascent with stops.  The diver who made 
the rapid ascent was airlifted to a recompression facility for 
treatment.  (Coastguard report).

Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 42m.  
They surfaced missing 20 min of stops at 3m.  They were 
placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  The divers 
were airlifted to a recompression facility.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2007 07/254 
Two divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 
26m.  After 24 min they ascended to the deck of the wreck in a 
depth of 20m and one of the divers deployed a delayed SMB.  
Underwater visibility was low and the divers became separated.  
The diver with the reel descended to the seabed to look for his 
buddy and then began his ascent alone.  He used the reel to 
wind himself up the SMB line.  At 16m he checked his 
instruments.  To do this he transferred the reel to his other hand 
and then back again.  He did not realise that in doing so he had 
accidentally changed the ratchet setting on the reel.  He was 
then unable to reel in further line.  He put some air into his 
BCD, but he was still not able to wind in line so he put more air 
into his BCD.  He began a rapid ascent.  He attempted to dump 
air from his BCD but was unable to prevent himself being 
carried directly to the surface.  His dive duration was 28 min.  
He was placed on oxygen for 20 min; no symptoms developed 
and no further action was taken.  He later discovered that the 
reel had four ratchet positions giving different functions; at the 
time he thought that there were only two. 
September 2007 07/331 
Two divers conducted a 15 min dive to a depth of 34m.  2 hours 
30 min later they dived to 25m but missed 10 min of 
decompression on their ascent.  The divers were placed on 
oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2007 07/220 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 35m.  One 
of the pair began to suffer from nitrogen narcosis, lost control of 
his buoyancy and made a rapid ascent to the surface.  He 
breathed out all the way.  His dive duration was 14 min.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and the diver and his buddy were 
airlifted to a recompression facility for treatment.  This was the 
diver's first dive to this depth for several months.  (Coastguard 
report). 
September 2007 07/229 
An instructor took two trainees on a training dive to a maximum 
depth of 6m.  One of the trainees experienced a pain in the right 
side of his mouth.  He ascended and re-descended, however 
the pain was still present and he aborted the dive, leaving the 
others to continue.  It was subsequently established that he had 
suffered a sinus problem.  The second trainee was conducting 
mask clearing drills when he panicked and made a rapid ascent 
to the surface without his mask.  The instructor calmed the diver 
and the dive continued. 
September 2007 07/369 
Two divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 
49m.  After about 45 min they began their ascent.  During the 
ascent one of the divers became agitated and his buddy found 
that this diver's diluent hose was disconnected; he re-connected 
it.  The ascent continued normally to about 15m where the 
agitated diver went directly to the surface.  The buddy 
completed the required stops.  The Coastguard was alerted.  
The diver developed a tingling in his left shoulder and he was 
taken to hospital.  He had been using a rebreather with a 14/35 
mix.  (Coastguard report). 
 
September 2007 07/370 
A diver ran out of air and surfaced missing stops.  He was 
placed on nitrox 30 and the Coastguard was alerted.  
(Coastguard report). 
September 2007 07/255 
A diver conducted a dive using a new twin cylinder and BCD 
system.  At the start of his dive he was unable to descend and 
he added 2 kg to his weights.  He descended to 29m and then 
moved down an underwater wall to a depth of 45m.  When he 
had 2 min of decompression indicated on his computer he 
started to ascend.  He had 110 bar remaining.  He deployed a 
delayed SMB.  He started to reel in the SMB line but the line 
remained slack and he could feel that he was buoyant.  He tried 
to dump air from his suit and BCD but could not see air coming 
out.  At 23m he swam back down to his buddy and gave him the 
reel so that he had more freedom to control his buoyancy.  At 
30m he was still unable to control his buoyancy, he released the 
direct feed hoses in case these were free-flowing air and he 
pulled his neck seal open.  He was unable to prevent himself 
being carried to the surface missing decompression stops.  His 
dive duration was 26 min.  He was recovered into his boat, 
placed on oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  Once 
ashore he was taken by ambulance to a recompression facility.  
He experienced no symptoms of DCI but was given 
precautionary recompression treatment.  He later discovered 
that the automatic dump valve on his drysuit was not fully open 
although this could have been moved after the dive.  The diver 
believes that he was at least 3 kg underweighted. 
September 2007 07/371 
Two divers dived to a maximum depth of 41m for 56 min and 
they surfaced missing 6 min of stops.  They were placed on 
oxygen and the Coastguard was alerted.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2007 07/246 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 34m.  One 
of the divers lost a fin and they decided to abort the dive.  They 
made their ascent during which one of their computers 
registered an emergency situation as they had missed 
decompression stops.  One of the divers was given oxygen but 
no subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
September 2007 07/257 
Two divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 
19m.  One of the pair had problems descending due to his 
buoyancy and he used the shotline to pull himself down.  During 
the rest of the dive his feet felt buoyant.  Towards the end of the 
dive he deployed a delayed SMB to make the ascent.  During 
deployment he drifted up to about 14m and then tried to swim 
back down.  He became inverted, lost control of his buoyancy 
and made a rapid feet first ascent to the surface.  His dive 
duration was 28 min.  He was recovered into the boat and 
placed on oxygen.  The Coastguard was alerted but no 
symptoms developed and no further action was taken.  It was 
subsequently determined that the diver was 3 kg 
underweighted. 
September 2007 07/375 
The Coastguard was alerted when a diver surfaced from a dive 
to 28m missing 8 min of decompression stops. (Coastguard

Two divers descended a shotline to a lake bed at a depth of 
33m.  They planned to make a circular search around the 
shotweight with the line fastened to the shotline 5m off the 
bottom.  They completed one circuit at a radius of 15m and 
started a second circuit at a radius of 20m with one of the pair 
holding the line loosely, 2m away, towards the shotline.  Part 
way through this second sweep the inner diver noticed that the 
line had become slack, he pulled on the line and found more 
slack.  He became entangled in this line and stirred up silt on 
the lake bottom.  He lay still on the lake bottom so that the other 
diver could try to release him.  He became inverted with his 
head sunk into the silt.  He was able to right himself but visibility 
reduced and the tangle became worse.  The divers decided to 
abort the dive and ascend a few metres to get better visibility 
and resolve the tangle.  The tangled diver noticed that he had 
12 min of decompression stops to complete.  The tangled diver 
cut the line and the other diver who was holding the reel started 
a buoyant ascent to the surface.  The diver who had been 
tangled managed to catch hold of him and he dumped air to try 
to slow the ascent.  They ascended buoyantly to the surface 
missing all stops.  Their dive duration was 30 min.  Both divers 
were recovered from the water and placed on oxygen.  The 
Coastguard was alerted and diving medical advice was sought.  
The divers were taken by ambulance to hospital.  They 
remained on oxygen for 6 hours; they developed no symptoms 
and were discharged from hospital. 
September 2007 07/341 
A diver conducted a 21 min dive to a maximum depth of 31m.  3 
hours later he dived to 29m.  When surfacing from this second 
dive he missed 2 min of stops at 3m.  He was placed on oxygen 
and the Coastguard was alerted.  Diving medical advice was 
sought and the diver was kept under observation.  (Coastguard 
report). 
September 2007 07/340 
A diver ascended from a dive to 37m missing 20 min of stops.  
His dive duration was 46 min.  The Coastguard was alerted and 
the diver was brought ashore by lifeboat and then taken by 
ambulance to a recompression facility.  (Coastguard report).

April 2007  07/062 
Two divers had just left the surface when one of them became 
inverted and lost her regulator.  Back on the surface she was 
face down and not breathing.  Her maximum depth was 3m and 
the dive duration 2 min.  Other divers helped to recover her from 
the water.  She quickly recovered and was placed on oxygen.  
No further ill effects were reported. 
May 2007 07/082 
A diver conducted a 32 min dive to a depth of 21m with a 3 min 
safety stop at 5m.  1 hour 56 min later she dived again, to a 
maximum depth of 15m.  During this dive the diver and her 
buddy met some other divers coming towards them.  The two 
pairs came very close together and the diver was concerned that 
her mask was going to be knocked off.  She then felt sick and 
took the regulator from her mouth.  Her buddy offered his 
alternative air source, he purged it and tried to place it in her 
mouth.  He then used a controlled buoyant lift to bring her to the 
surface.  Their dive duration was 16 min.  She was recovered 
from the water and placed on oxygen.  She slowly recovered.  It 
is thought that eating between the dives may have contributed to 
her feeling sick. 
May 2007 07/094 
Five pairs of divers entered the water for a dive on a wreck.  The 
maximum depth was 32m and the agreed dive duration was 40 
min.  One pair planned a 50 min dive but failed to let the skipper 
of the boat know this.  After 40 min four pairs had surfaced but 
there was no sign of the last pair.  After a further 10 min the 
skipper alerted the Coastguard.  Some minutes later the 
remaining pair deployed a delayed SMB and two sets of bubbles 
could be seen from the surface.  As the pair ascended, at a 
depth of about 17m, they realised that they had incurred a 27 
min decompression requirement.  They completed most of the 
stops at 6m and then ascended to 3m for the final 10 min in an 
attempt to make their air supplies last.  One of the pair was 
preparing to switch to his buddy's octopus regulator when they 
completed their stops.  They surfaced safely with a dive duration 
of 77 min.  Narcosis is thought to have played a central role in 
this incident; both divers had checked their air during the dive but 
not decompression requirements. 
June 2007 07/134 
A pair of divers conducted a buddy check and then entered the 
water to dive to a maximum depth of 24m.  One of the pair had 
unknowingly entered the water with his pony regulator in his 
mouth rather than his main regulator.  After 17 min he ran out of 
air.  He realised the problem and switched to his main regulator.  
They completed the dive with no further problems.  Both the 
regulators were black with black hoses.  The diver planned to 
provide some means of clear differentiation between the two. 
September 2007 07/259 
Two divers descended a shotline to a wreck.  At about 30m they 
let go of the shotline and dropped onto the wreck.  There  was  a 
 
 
 
current flowing.  They planned to stay on the wreck for about 6 
min in a depth of 35m.  They headed back towards the shotline, 
but this was difficult because they had to swim against the 
current.  They saw the shotline lying at an angle above them.  
They ascended to the line at a depth of 30m.  One of the pair 
then descended again while the other diver stayed on the line.  
The first diver then let go of the line and dropped back to 35m.  
She struggled against the current to get back to the line.  
Another diver in the party was on the line and she grabbed hold 
of this diver's fin to help her back to the line.  The shotline was 
sinking due to the pull of the divers and the diver found herself at 
a depth of about 40m.  She started to feel panicked, she was 
moving along the line but remained at 40m.  She could see her 
buddy but could not get to him.  She let go of the shotline and 
tried to ascend.  Her buddy was above her and seemed to be 
ascending, but the current was carrying her away.    She was still 
at 40m and concerned that she would run out of air.  She started 
to ascend and, at 30m, tried to deploy her delayed SMB.  She 
was unable to do so and ascended to 20m where she was able 
to launch the buoy.  She conducted an 11 min stop at 6m and 
arrived at the surface with 20 bar remaining in her main cylinder 
and her pony cylinder unused.  No subsequent ill effects were 
reported.  She believed that narcosis played a part in this 
incident.  (Relates to incident 07/250). 
September 2007 07/250 
A rebreather diver and an open circuit air diver commenced a 
wreck dive to a maximum depth of 40m.  They planned to 
ascend when the air diver had 5 min of no stop time remaining or 
she was down to 100 bar.  The divers completed their 
exploration of the wreck and returned to the shotline to make 
their ascent when the 5 min limit was reached.  They met two 
other divers on the shotline.  There was a current and one of 
these other divers was struggling to get back to the shotline; the 
diver on open circuit air stopped to help her.  The pull of the 
divers on the line caused the buoy to sink and the divers also 
started to descend; they sank back down to 40m.  The first two 
divers let go of the shotline and one of the pair deployed a 
delayed SMB.  By this time the air diver's computer indicated that 
she had a total time to surface of 20 min.  The rebreather diver 
completed a stop at 22m and had a further 1 min to complete at 
13m.  The rebreather diver signalled the air diver to ascend to 
6m to start her stops and he then joined her there later.  When 
the air diver's main cylinder was down to 25 bar she switched to 
her pony cylinder and when this got to 25 bar she used the 
rebreather diver's nitrox 50 cylinder.  The air diver was in a semi-
drysuit and she was getting very cold.  They completed 30 min of 
stops at 6m and, with 3 min remaining on the air diver's 
computer, they decided to surface. Their dive duration was 53 
min.  They were both safely recovered into the boat and no 
subsequent ill effects were experienced.  (Related to incident 
07/259)

Equipment 
 
 
May 2007  07/106 
An instructor and three trainees entered the water from a jetty to 
carry out alternative air source training.  They made a surface 
swim to a depth of 10m where the instructor deployed a 
weighted SMB as a reference point.  The divers descended and 
started the drills.  One trainee donated his alternative air source 
to another trainee and they ascended to 6m with the instructor 
and the third trainee ascending with them.  At 6m they stopped 
and the diver receiving air reverted to her own primary 
regulator.  The released octopus regulator then began to free 
flow and neither the diver nor the instructor could stop it.  The 
air in the donor's cylinder had dropped to less than 60 bar and 
he switched to his pony regulator.  All divers then returned to 
the surface.  The diver with the free flow was able to inflate his 
BCD.  A boat came to their assistance and the diver with the 
free flow was taken to the shore.  The boat then returned and 
followed as the other three swam back.  No subsequent ill 
effects were experienced. 
May 2007 07/136 
A cylinder had just been filled and the operator lifted it from the 
water bath.  As he turned away the valve exploded from the 
cylinder.  The valve, with filling hose still connected, struck and 
damaged the roof of the shed.  The cylinder inverted, shot 
through the roof of the shed and landed in a campsite some 
60m away, damaging a car.  The flailing filling hose badly 
bruised the operator's legs and damaged the mixing panel.  
Another cylinder which had lost its pressure hose broke the wall 
of the water bath.  Flying slates are thought to have damaged 
another car.  The operator reported subsequent visual and aural 
disturbances.  At a recent service a new valve had been fitted 
to this cylinder and it was subsequently determined that this 
new valve's thread was different to the thread in the cylinder. 
July 2007 07/203 
A group of divers entered the water and commenced their dive.  
One of these divers, who was in a group of three, experienced 
problems with his mask at a depth of 6m.  The dive leader 
helped by tightening the strap.  The diver then signalled that he 
was ready to continue.  By this time the three divers had lost 
contact with the others so they continued with the plan.  They 
descended to 14m and the dive leader spotted a rope that she 
thought led in their intended direction.  They followed the line 
down to 28m.  At this point there was no bottom in sight and 
they realised that they had gone in the wrong direction.  They 
ascended to 18m at which point the diver who had had earlier 
problems with his mask lost his mask completely.  He 
attempted to grab it but it sank away from him.  The dive leader 
placed the diver's hand on the rope and tried to indicate that 
they would follow it upwards and surface.  The diver began to 
panic and attempted to rush for the surface.  The other two 
attempted to stop him and calm him down.  In the struggle he 
knocked the mask off one of the other divers.  This diver refitted 
her mask and the dive leader took hold of the panicked diver 
and began a controlled buoyant lift.  All three ascended and at 
about 12m the ascent became fast.  The other diver dumped air 
from the panicked diver's drysuit by opening his neck seal.  
However the diver conducting the lift did not see this and she 
also dumped air from the diver's BCD.  This made them 
negatively buoyant and they sank back down to 19m before the 
diver conducting the lift was able to regain control.  At about 
16m the diver without his mask lost consciousness, his 
regulator fell from his mouth and his head rolled back.  The 
buddy replaced the regulator, held it in his mouth and pressed 
the purge.  The diver conducting the lift then made them 
positively buoyant and all three made a rapid ascent to the 
surface.  Their dive duration was 16 min.  At the surface they 
inflated the casualty's BCD and rolled him into a towing 
position.  The other two made themselves positively buoyant 
and signalled for assistance.  The rescuing diver prepared to 
give rescue breaths when the casualty was heard to groan.  He 
was recovered into a boat and regained consciousness.  All 
three were recovered from the water and placed on oxygen.   
No subsequent ill effects were reported. 
September 2007 07/334 
Two divers entered the water to conduct a shore dive.  After 60 
min one of the divers discovered that her BCD was dumping air 
and she could not maintain her buoyancy.  She tried to remove 
her weightbelt but it became entangled around her wrist.  The 
divers were at the surface in 6m of water.  The divers called for 
assistance, the Coastguard was alerted and a helicopter and a 
lifeboat were tasked to assist.  The divers managed to move to 
shallower water and release their weights.  A local fishing boat 
helped them to the shore.  Neither diver suffered subsequent ill 
effects.  It is thought that the BCD valve was faulty or jammed 
open.  (Coastguard report).

A guest attended a pool training session.  She asked to 
participate in a try-a-dive session but she had recently been in 
hospital with breathing difficulties and the request was declined.  
She was swimming in the pool when she was seen to get into 
difficulties and a diver entered the water to assist.  The casualty 
was helped from the water.  No subsequent ill effects were 
reported. 
April 2007 07/071 
Two divers made a shore dive.  They swam around a small 
island into a gulley where there was a heavy swell.  They 
became disorientated, backed out of the gulley and surfaced.  
They found themselves on the seaward side of the island, in 
rough water and out of sight of their shore party.  They dumped 
their weightbelts and climbed onto the island from where they 
were seen by their shore party.  They crossed the island and re-
entered the water on the sheltered side and swam ashore.  They 
suffered no ill effects.

RHIB also went to help.  But this RHIB suffered engine failure 
and the divers made the shore safely before the lifeboat arrived.  
(Coastguard report). 
September 2007 07/224 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 48m using 
trimix 21/35.  After a bottom time of 32 min they ascended to 
21m and switched to nitrox 50.  They tried to read dive planning 
notes from a waterproof notebook that they had but found that 
the pages were stuck together.  They spent 10 min at 21m and 
then ascended to 18m.  They were still unable to read their notes 
and they realised, from the three computers that they had with 
them, that they were running over the planned dive time.  They 
decided to write a note for the boat crew to let them know that 
there was no problem but the dive would be longer than planned.  
They sent this note to the surface using their emergency/distress 
delayed SMB.  The emergency SMB was seen by the surface 
team, but the attached note was not.  The Coastguard was 
alerted and a helicopter was sent to assist.  The divers surfaced 
after a dive duration of 92 min.  No subsequent ill effects were 
experienced.  (Coastguard report).

Overseas Incidents 
 
 
Fatalities 
February 2007  07/025 
A diver became separated from his buddy in the early stages of 
a dive.  The alarm was raised when the diver failed to surface.  
An extensive search was conducted over a number of days but 
the diver was not found. 
July 2007 07/155 
Two pairs and one trio of divers planned to explore a wreck at a 
maximum depth of 76m using trimix 10/52.  One pair 
descended the shotline to the wreck and checked each other as 
they descended.  Each diver left a tally on a ring on the shotline 
at 55m.  One of the pair descended to the seabed and the other 
diver stopped at about 55m.  The diver on the seabed assumed 
the diver at 55m was aborting the dive and returning to the 
surface.  On ascent the last diver removed the last tally and cut 
the decompression system free from the shotline.  The group of 
six divers completed their decompression and left the water with 
a total dive duration of 160 min.  When they were back in the 
boat it was discovered that the seventh diver, the one who had 
stopped at 55m, was missing.  The Coastguard was alerted and 
an extensive search was conducted involving 2 helicopters, 2 
lifeboats, 1 warship and 12 other vessels.  The search was 
continued the following day.  The diver's body was located 
underwater the following day and recovered.  The rebreather 
was switched on and appeared to be working; its gas cylinders 
were not empty but the counter lung was believed to have been 
flooded. 
September 2007 07/231 
At a depth of 24m three divers stirred up the silt on the bottom 
and one of the three became separated from the other two.  
The alarm was raised when this separated diver failed to 
surface.  A surface search was conducted involving a helicopter 
and two lifeboats over a period of two days.  The following day, 
the diver's body was located, at a depth of 31m, close to the 
point where he had gone missing.  It was reported that the 
diver's gas cylinder was empty. 
 
 
 
 
Decompression Illness 
November 2006 07/021 
A diver was engaged in the third day of a cave diving training 
course at an inland site.  He dived to 21m for 55 min with a 2 
min stop at 6m.  1 hour 34 min later he dived to 20m for 71 min 
with a 3 min stop at 6m.  He was diving with nitrox 32.  3 hours 
later he noticed a slight itching on the back of his left hand.  The 
following morning the symptoms were still present and he 
noticed a slight pain in his left shoulder when lifting things.  He 
sought diving medical advice and went to a recompression 
facility for treatment. 
February 2007 07/031 
A diver conducted a dive to a depth of 40m.  After surfacing she 
developed symptoms of DCI and was taken to a recompression 
facility.  Initially she was paralysed from the neck down but 
began to recover with medical treatment. 
April 2007 07/125 
A diver conducted a 13 min dive to a depth of 25m with a 3 min 
stop.  1 hour 45 min later she dived to 28m for 38 min with an 
average depth of 16m.  Later that day she developed a rash 
across her stomach and the skin down the side of her body was 
a deep purple.  She was placed on oxygen and taken by 
helicopter to a recompression facility where she received two 
sessions of treatment. 
April 2007 07/078 
A diver conducted a 33 min dive to a maximum depth of 31m 
using nitrox 32 as his dive gas. He conducted a 1 min stop at 
10m and a 3 min stop at 5m on nitrox 50.  The following day he 
discovered a rash on both arms and had aching elbows.  He 
sought medical advice and was recompressed; the following 
day he received a second session of recompression treatment.  
Three days later he flew home and developed further symptoms 
of DCI during the flight.  He received a third session of 
recompression treatment. 
July 2007 07/161 
A diver made a dive to a maximum depth of 58m using air.  He 
ascended slowly to about 5m where he spent 20 min.  His total 
dive duration was 50 min.  An unspecified time later he dived to 
39m and then ascended to about 5m where he spent the next 
75 min.  His total dive duration was 105 min.  For part of his 
decompression he held onto a line from the boat, mainly with 
his right hand.  The motion of the boat pulled on his arm.  Once 
back on the boat he began to notice a pain in his right shoulder.  
The pain slowly increased and later that day he attended 
hospital.  Diving medical advice was sought and the diver was 
placed on oxygen and a drip containing an anti-inflammatory 
drug.  8 hours later he was examined again and he was given 
recompression treatment which resolved his symptoms. 
August 2007 07/209 
A diver dived to a maximum depth of 42m.  After a surface 
interval of 2 hours 45 min she dived to 36m.  She experienced 
total left side paralysis whilst still in the water.  She was 
recovered into the boat.  She was confused and unresponsive 
with slurred speech.  She was placed on oxygen and, at first, 
her condition improved but then worsened again.  The 
emergency services were alerted and the boat returned to a 
harbour where the casualty was taken by ambulance to a 
recompression facility.  She began recompression therapy 10 
hours and 30 min after the incident and received a series of 6 
treatments.  At the time of reporting she had made a 95% 
recovery. 
 
 
 
 
Illness / Injury 
December 2006 07/051 
A diver conducted a 20m dive for 37 min including 3 min at 6m.  
16 hours 30 min later he dived to 26m for 33 min including a 2 
min safety stop at 6m.  He climbed a ladder to get back on the 
boat and whilst doing so felt a 'click' in his back.  He 
experienced intense pain in his middle thoracic vertebrae.   He 
had experienced a previous back injury and it was thought that 
this was related.  The pain eased, but 24 min after surfacing he 

  NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2007 
38  ©BSAC - 2007 
started to experience a burning sensation in both thighs 
followed by a tingling down to his big toes.  He also had a 
weakness in his legs.  He was placed on oxygen and medical 
advice was sought.  The symptoms quickly eased and were 
fully resolved 45 min later.  He was taken, with his buddy, to a 
recompression facility but no treatment was considered 
necessary.  He was given anti-inflammatory drugs and advised 
not to dive for 24 hours.  After this he continued diving with no 
further problems. 
January 2007 07/053 
A diver conducted a 24 min dive to 20m with a 3 min safety stop 
at 6m.  On surfacing he reported an intense toothache.  The 
party returned to the shore and medical advice was sought.  He 
was given pain killers.  It was found that the diver had been 
suffering from tooth pain before the dive due to a filling that had 
become displaced; he had not declared this.  The following day 
a temporary replacement filling was made and further pain 
killers were given. 
March 2007 07/181 
A diver conducted a 25 min dive to a depth of 15m.  The diver 
had experienced problems clearing his ears and on surfacing it 
was discovered that he had suffered a nose bleed. 
March 2007 07/182 
A diver conducted a 38 min dive to a depth of 9m.  At the end of 
the dive he had to fin hard against a current.  After the dive he 
complained of a tightness and pains in his chest.  There was 
some blotching and tenderness on his chest.  He was placed on 
oxygen and medical advice was sought.  He went to hospital 
and a number of tests were conducted.  It was concluded that 
he had suffered stress induced high blood pressure. 
May 2007 07/186 
An instructor and a trainee conducted a dive to a maximum 
depth of 10m.  During the descent, at about 6m, the trainee 
indicated that he was having problems clearing his ears.  They 
ascended to 5m and then descended slowly.  The majority of 
the dive was at a depth of 5m and no further problems were 
experienced.  Upon surfacing blood was discovered in the 
trainee's face mask.  It is thought that he had had a nose bleed 
and he sought medical advice. 
July 2007 07/193 
A trainee was engaged in a diving course in a swimming pool 
with a maximum depth of 3m.  During the course he mentioned 
that he had a 'ringing' in his left ear.  He spent 3 hours 
underwater in total during the course and continued to 
experience the sensation intermittently, although there was no 
pain.  The following day he said that there was some loss of 
hearing but he was happy to continue.  That day he completed 
two open water dives of 35 min and 45 min duration to a 
maximum depth of 5m.  At the end of this second day the 
symptoms were worse and medical advice was sought.  The 
following day he underwent a medical examination and a 
hearing impairment was the only problem found.  The trainee 
was given three sessions of recompression treatment over a 
three day period.  A previous medical examination had 
diagnosed a leaking heart valve and a slight heart murmur but 
he was cleared to dive. 
July 2007 07/194 
A diver completed a 45 min dive to 30m with a 3 min safety stop 
at 6m.  3 hours later he dived to 25m.  During the dive he 
developed a sinus pain and headache and indicated this to the 
dive leader.  After a further 5 min he signalled that all was not 
well and the pair ascended to 6m for a 3 min safety stop and 
then ascended very slowly to the surface.  At the surface the 
dive leader signalled for assistance and two snorkel divers from 
the boat came to assist.  Back on the boat the diver complained 
of a severe headache.  He was placed on oxygen and medical 
advice was sought.  The boat returned to the shore and the 
diver was taken by ambulance, with his buddy, to hospital.  
From here he was airlifted to a recompression facility.  The 
cause of his problem was found to be dehydration.  The dive 
took place in hot conditions. 
August 2007 07/225 
A diver was engaged in a training programme and had 
completed a number of dives during the week.  On his last dive 
he cleared his ears at 3m but at 7m he was unable to clear his 
right ear.  He ascended with his instructor to 5m where he was 
able to clear his ear.  At this point he developed a nose bleed 
into this mask.  He cleared his mask but the bleeding continued.  
The dive was aborted and he sought diving medical advice.  It 
is thought that the problem was related to a previous cold and 
infection that he had had. 
August 2007 07/240 
A diver reported to others that he was able to blow cigarette 
smoke out of his ear.  He sought medical advice and a ruptured 
eardrum was diagnosed.  The diver had been hit on the side of 
the head as a child and had subsequently been very close to an 
explosion.  It was thought that one of these events had caused 
the rupture. 
 
 
 
 
Boating and Surface 
February 2007 07/027 
A group of divers dived from a boat.  The plan was for the boat 
to follow the divers and pick them up when they surfaced under 
a delayed SMB.  At the end of the dive the divers surfaced and 
found that the boat was not there.  They spotted the boat some 
distance away from them but it did not move to them.  They 
swam 1.5 to 2 km to get back to the boat where they were 
safely recovered.  They discovered that the boat's engine had 
failed 10 min after the dive began.  After the engine failed the 
bilge pump also failed and the battery room was flooded.  They 
eventually managed to restart the engine.  Further diving was 
cancelled and the boat returned to the marina. 
April 2007 07/217 
A diver rolled into the water from an RHIB in rough sea 
conditions.  He then realised that he had forgotten his 
weightbelt, decided to abort the dive, and climbed back into the 
boat.  He then leaned over the side of the boat to help his 
buddy with her kit.  At that point a large wave broke over them, 
flooding the boat.  The boat was turned over and all the 
equipment and passengers were thrown into the water.  The 
diver who had been leaning over the side was pushed 
underwater with his lungs only partially filled.  He was 
disorientated and struggled to find the surface as other waves 
broke over them.  He came close to drowning but finally made 
the surface, regrouped with his buddy and the boat's skipper 
and climbed onto a coral reef.  The boat was upside down and it 
blew away from them.  They used a radio to call for help and 
were recovered into another dive boat. 
August 2007 07/228 
An RHIB left shore for a dive trip.  After 10 min the engine 
stopped and could not be restarted.  The divers reported their

situation by radio and then tried to find and rectify the fault.  
They concluded that the battery was fully discharged.  They 
radioed for assistance and were towed back to their launch 
point. 
 
 
 
 
Ascents 
November 2006 07/009 
Two divers swam on the surface from the shore and then made 
a slow descent to a wreck at a depth of 19m.  One of the pair 
had not dived for a year and, at 19m, began to panic.  There 
were a lot of bubbles in the water and the other diver could not 
see what the problem was.  He offered her his octopus 
regulator, which she took, and they started a rapid ascent.  The 
supporting diver was able to dump air from both their BCDs and 
brought the ascent under control at 8m.  They reached the 
surface safely and swam back to the shore.  Their dive duration 
was 11 min.  They had an uneventful dive 2 hours later. 
November 2006 07/010 
An instructor and three students were engaged in a training 
session in a swimming pool.  They were practicing the use of 
alternative air sources in a depth of 3m.  One of the students 
took the alternative air source of one of the other students but 
put it into her mouth upside down.  She inhaled water, panicked 
and rushed for the surface.  The instructor took hold of the 
student and slowed her ascent.  He offered his own alternative 
air source but this was refused.  At the surface the student 
quickly recovered.  The students had been briefed to check for 
the correct orientation of the regulator. 
February 2007 07/054 
Two instructors and two trainees were engaged in a training 
course.  Their task was to lift a shot and to deploy a delayed 
SMB mid-water.  During the mid-water deployment of the 
delayed SMBs both trainees lost control of their buoyancy and 
started to ascend.  The instructor signalled them to stop but 
they failed to do so.  The instructor followed them up.  He saw 
that they were safe at the surface, completed a safety stop at 
6m and then ascended to the surface.  Their maximum depth 
was 16m and their dive duration 27 min.  No subsequent ill 
effects were experienced and no further action was taken. 
March 2007 07/251 
Two divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 35m 
using nitrox 27.  Their plan was to ascend using a shotline that 
was off to one side of the wreck.  Towards the end of their dive 
they attempted to return to the shotline but swam away from the 
wrong side of the wreck.  They then spotted the shotline in the 
distance but one of the pair was low on air.  They 
 
 
 
decided to ascend using a delayed SMB.  At about 15m the 
diver who was low on air realised that she was down to 50 bar.  
She panicked and made a rapid ascent to the surface; her 
buddy ascended at a normal rate.  The panicked diver was 
placed on nitrox 50 and then oxygen.  No subsequent ill effects 
were experienced and no further action was taken. 
April 2007 07/063 
Two divers dived to a maximum depth of 27m.  At 20m one of 
the pair lost control of his buoyancy and made a fast ascent to 
the surface.  His buddy tried to slow him but lost him at 8m.  
The diver then re-descended to 20m followed by his buddy.  
They moved to the edge of a reef at 15m where they checked 
air.  The diver who had made the buoyant ascent was found to 
be out of air.  They surfaced using the buddy's octopus 
regulator and completed a 3 min stop at 6m.  The divers were 
recovered from the water and the diver who had been out of air 
was placed on oxygen.  No subsequent ill effects were 
experienced. 
 
 
 
 
Technique 
July 2007 07/166 
A relatively inexperienced diver led two trainees on a dive.  The 
dive plan was for them to follow the boat's anchor line down to 
18m, where it crossed a ridge, and then follow the seabed 
gradually upwards with a safety stop at 6m.  The divers 
descended, mistook their direction, and followed the line all the 
way down to the anchor at a depth of 30m.  They then swam in 
the wrong direction and ended up at a depth of 46m.  The dive 
leader then realised the mistake and led a controlled ascent 
including a 3 min safety stop.  Their dive duration was 15 min.  
The divers were monitored for DCI but no ill effects resulted. 
 
 
 
 
Equipment 
March 2007 07/056 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 29m. He was 
using a twin cylinder setup with independent regulators.  After 
23 min he was at 25m.  At this point, the pressure gauge of the 
regulator that he was not using exploded, shattering and 
expelling the face glass, and forcing the dial outwards.  He 
states that the gauge had not been damaged before the event.  
He completed his dive safely.
