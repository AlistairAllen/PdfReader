Introduction 
 
This booklet contains the 2011 Diving Incidents Report, produced by The British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC) in the 
interest of promoting diving safety.  It is important to note that it contains details of UK sports diving incidents 
occurring to divers of all affiliations, plus incidents occurring worldwide involving BSAC members.  
The 2011 ‘Incident Year’ ran from 1st October 2010 to 30th September 2011. 
 
Report Format 
The majority of statistical information contained within this report is also shown in graphical form.  Please note that all 
statistical information is produced from UK data only and does not include Overseas Incidents unless noted as ‘All 
Incidents’. 
The contents of this report are split into an overview of the year, and then the details of nine incident categories plus some 
historical analyses.  The various sections can be found as shown below:- 
 
 i) Overview Page  1 
 ii) Fatalities Page 6 
 iii) Decompression Incidents Page  8 
 iv) Injury / illness Page  19 
 v) Boating & Surface Incidents Page  27 
 vi) Ascent Incidents Page  35 
 vii) Technique Incidents Page  40 
 viii) Equipment Incidents Page  41 
 ix) Miscellaneous Incidents Page  43 
 x) Overseas Incidents Page  44 
 xi) Numerical & Statistical Analyses Page  47 
 xii) List of Abbreviations Page  49 
 
Within each category the incidents are listed in the order of their occurrence, not necessarily that of Incident Reference.  
They are laid out in the following form: 
 
  MONTH/YEAR OF INCIDENT  INCIDENT REF.    
  Brief Narrative of Incident.................................................................................... 
  ........................................................................................................ 
 
The nature of many diving incidents is such that there is usually more than one cause or effect.  Where this is the case the 
incident has been classified under the more appropriate cause or effect. For instance an incident involving a fast ascent, 
causing decompression illness, will be classified under 'Decompression Incidents'.

 NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2011   
Overview 
 
has seen 375 UK diving incidents reported.  This 
is entirely in line with recent years, as the graph 
below shows.  The number of incidents reported 
rose progressively during the 90s to peak at around 440 
incidents per year.  In recent years this number has dropped 
back a little and is now, typically, around 380.   
2011 Incidents by category The incident database assigns all incidents into one of nine 
major categories, and the following chart shows the distribution 
of the 2011 incidents into those categories.

The distribution of reported incidents by month is shown in the 
following chart and it follows the normal pattern, with 71% of the 
dives taking place in the summer months.  This pattern reflects 
the fact that much more diving is conducted in the summer than 
in the winter.  The spike in April and dip in May is a little 
unusual but Easter was in April and we had some very good 
weather at that time, which, no doubt, encouraged more people 
to go diving.

Number of incidents 
Incident year 108 'Boating and Surface' incidents were recorded in the 2011 
incident year making it the biggest single category; it is ten 
years since this group has topped the list.  This category mainly 
comprises of problems with boat engines (engine failure and 
out of fuel) and lost diver(s).  There had been a strong 
downward trend in the ten year period starting in the late 90s 
but in recent years the numbers have jumped back up and this 
year's record continues that trend. 
 
The next largest category is DCI with 103 incidents reported.  
Normally this is the largest group and the total this year is very 
much in line with the average of previous recent years. 
 
The third category is 'Illness and Injury' with 84 incidents 
reported.  The bulk of this is thought to be cases of DCI.  But 
these cases are reported through the RNLI and their reports do 
not specifically record DCI, they often just state ‘Diver illness’.  
For this reason it is not possible to distinguish cases of DCI 
from other diver ailments.  This category is about 20% higher 
that the average of recent years but this is not thought to be 
significant.   
 
‘Ascents’ is the fourth category and this involves incidents  
where divers have made an abnormal ascent but avoided DCI 
or other injury.  This category peaked in 2006 and has been 
steadily falling since that time.  It is good to see that this trend 
has continued in the 2011 incident year.  48 'Ascent' related 
incidents were reported and one has to go back to 1999 to find 
a lower number.  A lot of effort has been put into improving 
diver buoyancy control and these numbers reflect the beneficial 
changes that have been made.   
 
The last category to be mentioned specifically is ‘Fatalities’ and 
although the numbers are quite small it is, of course, the most 
serious.  This year saw 11 diver fatalities; this is substantially 
lower than the average of the preceding ten years which was 
15.8. 
 
More analysis on these key incident categories is given later in 
the report.

Incident depths 
The following chart shows the maximum depth of the dives 
during which incidents took place, categorised into depth range 
groupings.

The pattern of depths in the 0m to 50m range is very similar to 
that normally seen and reflects the amount of diving that takes 
place in these depth ranges.   
The number of incidents reported in the greater than 50m 
ranges is 6, a little lower than most previous years.  However it 
is worth noting that 2 of these 6 incidents involved fatalities. 
  
BSAC advises that no air dive should be deeper than 50m, and 
that dives to 50m should only be conducted by divers who are 
appropriately trained and qualified.   
The recommended limit for divers trained to Sports Diver 
standard is 35m and then only when they have received 
appropriate training for diving at this depth. 
BSAC recommends that helium mixtures are used for depths 
deeper than 40m and that mixed gas diving should be to a 
maximum depth of 80m.  Mixed gas dives should only be 
conducted when the diver holds a recognized qualification to 
conduct such dives.  
See the BSAC website for more details of these and other 
diving depth limit recommendations.  
 
The next chart shows the depths at which incidents started.

Inevitably the data are biased towards the shallower depths 
since many incidents happen during the ascent or at the 
surface.  Critical among these are the DCI cases where almost 
always the casualty is out of the water before any problems are 
noted.  This partially explains the large occurrence of ‘Surface’ 
cases as this includes divers with DCI who have left the water. 
Other surface incidents involve boats and boating incidents and 
divers who are lost but on the surface. 
 
The depth profiles are consistent with previous years. 
 
Diver qualifications 
The next two charts show the qualification of those BSAC 
members who were involved in reported incidents.    
The first looks at the diver qualification.

These data are in line with the normal pattern of previous years

Divers’ use of the Emergency Services 
Divers’ use of the emergency services shows a monthly 
distribution aligned to the distribution of all incidents, and is 
clearly correlated with the number of dives that are taking place. 
 
205 incidents were reported to us by the Coastguard; this is 
entirely consistent with recent years.

Incidents involving HM Coastguard: 205   
There were 118 incidents reported that involved the RNLI.  
Previous years had seen a steady decline in divers’ need for 
lifeboat assistance.  However the last three years have seen 
that trend reversed.  The RNLI’s main involvement with divers 
involves assistance with disabled boats, searching for missing 
divers and the recovery of divers with DCI.  As pointed out 
earlier the 'Boat and Surface' category has risen and this will 
inevitably increase divers' calls upon the RNLI.

In 2011 96 incidents involved the use of helicopters.  This is in 
line with the average of recent past years which is around 100 
helicopter calls per year. 
 
In diving related incidents helicopters are mainly tasked to 
support searches for missing divers and to transport divers with 
DCI to recompression facilities.

Fatalities 
11 fatal incidents occurred in the UK during the 2011 incident 
year.  This is well below the average of 15.8 fatalities per year 
over the previous ten years.   
4 of these people were BSAC members.  The previous ten year 
average for BSAC fatalities in the UK is 6.1 fatalities per year.  
However, one shouldn't read too much into these reductions.  A 
review of the past twenty years indicates that the number of 
annual fatalities can range from as few as 9 to as many as 25. 
This  year the number of fatalities has been relatively low, but 
this, sadly, can not be interpreted as a downward trend.  
 
Key factors associated with these fatalities can be summarised 
as follows:- 
? One case involved a diver who suffered from a serious 
medical condition that led to his death.  Additionally there 
are four other cases where it seems very likely that the 
diver suffered a 'medical event' whilst underwater, although 
evidence to substantiate this assumption is not currently 
available. 
? Six cases involved a separation of some kind.  Three of 
these cases involved divers who became separated during 
the dive, either deliberately or accidentally.  Two cases 
involved separation during the ascent from a dive. In one 
case there is insufficient information to comment.  
Separation in itself is not a cause of death but death might 
have been avoided if the casualties' buddies had been with 
them and thus potentially able to help resolve any 
subsequent problems. 
? Six cases involved divers diving in a group of three or more.  
Five of these six involved separation.  It is clear that there is 
more opportunity for a diver to become separated and end 
up effectively diving solo if they are part of a group.  In a 
buddy pair it is obvious when a separation has happened 
and the two divers usually react quickly.  In a group it is 
possible for a separation to go un-noticed. 
? Two cases involved dives to greater than 50m.  One was to 
55m and the other to 61m.  Only six incidents were reported 
involving dives to greater than 50m; two of these were 
fatalities. 
? Two incidents involved divers running out of gas.  In one 
case a diver ran out during an ascent and was lost as a 
result.  The second case involved a cave diver diving in a 
group of three; this diver somehow became separated from 
the others. 
? Two cases involved a rapid ascent.  In one case the diver 
had drysuit control problems and made a buoyant ascent 
that resulted in fatal DCI.  In the second case the diver 
made a rapid ascent as a result of other problems. 
? One case involved a cave diver (as described above).  
Cave diving is an activity in its own right but such incidents 
are included in our database for completeness.

Incidents involving Lifeboats: 118

   NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2011 
Often multiple causes were involved in an incident and with 
many of these fatal incidents there is currently insufficient 
information available to be clear about the exact chain of events 
and specific root causes.  Often new information comes to light 
(from coroners’ inquests for example) after the publication of the 
annual report.  Such information is added to the incident 
database for future research purposes.   
 
Diver age has been highlighted in recent years as a feature of 
note in the year’s fatal incidents, with a disproportionate rate of 
fatalities amongst older divers.  This year sees a continuation of 
this trend;  8 (73%) of the 2011 fatalities involved divers over 
the age of 50.  This is against a background of only 16% of the 
diving population being over 50 (from a BSAC UK site survey). 
The natural tendency is for health and fitness to decline with 
increasing age and the above numbers seem to indicate that 
divers need to pay more attention to these aspects as they grow 
older. 
However, it is worth noting two additional points here:- 
? Although 8 fatalities involved divers who were over 50, only 
4 of these were thought to have had medically related 
problems that led to their deaths. 
? One of the divers who did suffer a related medical problem 
was only 26 years old.   
 
 
Decompression incidents 
The BSAC database contains 103 reports of ‘DCI’ incidents in 
the 2011 incident year, some of which involved more than one 
casualty.  When these multiple cases are counted the result is 
107 cases of DCI. 
 
An analysis of the causal factors associated with the 103 
incidents reported in 2011 indicates the following major 
features:- 
31 involved repeat diving  
28 involved rapid ascents 
27 involved diving to deeper than 30m 
17 involved missed decompression stops  
Some cases involved more than one of these factors. 
 
The content and order of this list is virtually identical with 
previous years. 
As stated earlier, some of the ‘Injury and Illness’ incidents are 
also thought to be DCI related.   
 
 
Boating and Surface incidents 
This category of incident has seen a significant rise with a total 
of 108 incidents reported.  The factors associated with these 
incidents are as follows:- 
 46 involved engine problems 
 44 involved lost diver(s) 
 10 involved boat problems 
   7 involved bad seamanship 
Some cases involved more than one of these factors. 
 
Boat and engine problems have seen a rise in recent years but 
the total for 2011 is in line with those recent years. 
The big change has come in the number of cases of 'lost 
diver(s)' which, in 2011, is about double the number of cases 
seen annually in the last 10 years.   
There are a number of reasons for divers becoming lost:- 
? Engine or boat problems that prevent the divers from being 
followed. 
? Sea and/or surface conditions that carry divers away and 
make them difficult to see. 
? Failure of divers to surface at the planned time and in the 
planned location. 
? Failure of divers to deploy delayed SMBs when planned. 
? Failure of divers to surface when a separation has taken 
place.   
All of these issue occurred this year, but what is noticeable is 
the number of cases where the diver(s) were in fact not in 
trouble and were found before the emergency services were on 
scene.  It is possible that cases of lost diver are being reported 
earlier than in previous years.  If this is so it is a good thing, 
since the Coastguard would much rather know of an incident 
sooner rather than later; an early report greatly increases the 
likelihood of a successful search.   
 
 
Ascent related incidents 
The good news in 2011 is that 'ascent' related incidents are at 
their lowest number for over 10 years. 
48 cases of ‘Ascent’ problems were recorded in 2011 and the 
majority of these were ‘rapid ascents’.  An analysis of these 
‘rapid ascents’ (where the detail is known) is as follows:- 
 37% Simply poor buoyancy control  
 11% Panic / anxiety / rush for surface  
 11% Drysuit control malfunction/mis-use  
 8% Delayed SMB problems  
     8% Regulator free flows 
 8% Out of air / gas 
 3% Weighting or weight related problems 
 
These causal factors are very similar to those seen in abnormal 
ascents for many previous years, it is just that there have been 
fewer of them. 
 
It is certain that many other such cases have gone un-reported 
but it is anticipated that these root causes will apply to all 
uncontrolled ascents.   
 
Many DCI cases have their roots in these problems; they have 
been recorded under the ‘DCI’ heading but the causal factors 
are often the same, so the actual number of abnormal ascents 
will be significantly higher than 48 cases.  This year’s DCI 
cases included 28 incidents where rapid ascents had taken 
place. 
 
 
Conclusions 
Key conclusions are:- 
? The number of incidents reported each year in the UK 
seems to have levelled out at around 370 cases. 
? The number of fatalities of BSAC members is 2.1 lower than 
the average of the previous 10 years. 
? The number of fatalities of non-BSAC members is 2.7 lower 
than the average of the previous 10 years. 
? Diver age and related health and fitness issues are 
emerging as critical factors in this and recent years’ 
fatalities.  The average age of the subjects of this year’s 
diving fatalities was 54 years (a little higher than recent 
years); the average age of the background diving 
population is 38.  However, a number of the fatalities of 
'older divers' had no apparent age related cause. 
? Ascent related incidents continue to reduce. 
? Incidents relating to boat problems (engine and fuel) remain 
high and cases of 'lost diver' have increased.   
 
 
As has been stated many times before, most of the incidents 
reported within this document could have been avoided had 
those involved followed a few basic principles of safe diving 
practice.  The BSAC publishes a booklet called 'Safe Diving' 
(latest edition published in September 2010). which 
summarises all the key elements of safe diving and is available 
to all, free of charge, from the BSAC website or through BSAC 
HQ.

Fatalities 
 
November 2010 11/002 
An experienced diver was taking part in a rebreather try dive at 
an inland site; he had had no previous experience with this 
equipment.  Competence skills were conducted at 6m and the 
group moved down to 18m.  The diver was seen coughing into 
the loop and he then began to ascend.  His buddy went with 
him and attempted to control the ascent.  At the surface the 
diver complained that it was hard to breathe; he was told to 
switch to open circuit and they swam back to the shore.  He 
was helped from the water but then lost consciousness.  CPR 
was started. The diver was airlifted to hospital by an air 
ambulance helicopter but was declared deceased on arrival at 
hospital. 
November 2010 11/003 
A group of three divers were diving from the shore at an inland 
site with the intention of visiting one of the wreck features.  After 
30 min the divers had still not found the wreck and reached the 
far side of the lake. The group decided to ascend and one diver 
became separated from the other two. The remaining pair 
continued their ascent and one noticed that the other's suit 
seemed to be over-inflated.  Dumping air from her BCD did not 
slow the ascent, she lost control and made a rapid ascent to the 
surface. The remaining diver made a normal ascent and 
conducted a 3 min safety stop during which she was able to see 
the diver who had the fast ascent.  On surfacing she found that 
her buddy was inverted and unconscious on the surface and 
she raised the alarm. The site's rescue boat responded and the 
unconscious diver was recovered from the water.  Resuscitation 
attempts were made but the diver did not recover. Her buddy 
was assisted to the shore by other divers. The third diver 
surfaced some distance away and made his way back to shore.  
A media report of the coroner's inquest stated that the casualty 
had suffered a collapsed lung and tissue damage caused by the 
rapid ascent.

A group of divers completed a dive to 17m for a duration of 60 
min.  After a surface interval they commenced a second dive to 
collect scallops in approx 21m of water. The sea was calm with 
approximately 1 knot of current.  Some of the group were 
wearing twin-sets and at least one diver was using a 15 ltr 
cylinder. Once all of the divers had reboarded the boat they 
noticed that one of the group was missing and that there was no 
visible delayed SMB.  The Coastguard was alerted and a 
search was initiated involving a helicopter, two lifeboats and 
other craft.  The diver was not located and the search was 
called off at 20:00. 
March 2011 11/031 
Three divers entered the water just before slack for a dive on a 
wreck in 62m of water.  The three divers were all using trimix 
(30% helium) as a bottom gas and had planned 18 min bottom 
time and total dive time of 60 min.  During the descent one diver 
had problems with sinus pain but it cleared and he continued.  
On approaching the bottom of the shotline the diver who had 
experienced the sinus pain overtook the diver who was then in 
the lead and dropped off the shotline onto the wreck.  The third 
diver in the group also passed the diver in the lead and was 
waving his unlit torch. The lead diver passed him his spare 
torch and the third diver continued his descent to the wreck 
dropping off the shotline in the opposite direction to the other 
diver.  The diver who had been in the lead then joined the diver 
with the sinus problem and both made their way along the 
wreck towards the third diver.  As they moved along they could 
see a light but it was not moving and they found the torch 
previously passed to the third diver switched on but lodged in 
the top of the wreck. One of the other divers picked up the torch 
and clipped it onto his harness and, looking around, saw the 
third diver 4m away and 2m above him in an upright position 
and not making any rapid movements or appearing to panic. 
This was the last that the divers saw of the third diver.  The 
surface cover RHIB was approaching the shot buoy in 
preparation to deploy another pair of divers when they saw a 
delayed SMB arrive on the surface about 10 min after the three 
had started their dive. Shortly after this the third diver was seen 
to surface rapidly feet first with a fully inflated suit and fall back 
onto his back.  The divers who were about to dive were 
immediately advised of an emergency and stood down whilst 
the boat was motored towards the surfaced diver.  As they 
approached the diver was lying still, had a blue grey colour and 
was unresponsive.  A 'Mayday' call was made whilst the diver 
was de-kitted, recovered from the water and laid down inside 
the RHIB.  The oxygen kit was prepared and it was found that 
the diver was not breathing so CPR was commenced.  The 
Coastguard tasked a helicopter to respond and a Royal Navy 
warship responded and approached closely before launching an 
RHIB and lowering a stretcher.  The diver was winched onto the 
warship and subsequently airlifted from the deck of the warship 
by helicopter to hospital. The diver did not recover.  The diver 
had been using independent twin cylinders and these were 
found to still contain 130 bar and 160 of gas respectively.

Two divers aborted the first dive of the day when one of their 
torches failed during the descent to a wreck.  A second dive 
was conducted later in the day to a maximum depth of 22m to 
collect scallops.  After a period of time the buddy was down to 
40 bar in twin 12 ltr cylinders and asked the other diver how 
much gas he had, the other diver indicated 50 bar in a single 
15 ltr cylinder.  The buddy signalled to ascend and the second

diver unhooked his delayed SMB and reel and deployed it.  He 
then continued to collect scallops and passed the SMB reel to 
his buddy.  The diver bagged the remaining scallops he had 
collected and then both divers ascended to a depth of 5m.  At 
this point the diver started to fumble for his pony regulator but 
got this tangled with the necklace on his main regulator.  His 
buddy came close and passed over his own alternate source 
which the diver took but put it in upside down.  He grabbed hold 
of his buddy and both began to descend.  The buddy managed 
to turn the regulator round and purge it but the diver was now 
unresponsive.  Both divers arrived on the seabed and the buddy 
attempted to lift both of them on his wing but ran out of gas at 
this point.  The troubled diver was still gripping the buddy's 
equipment and would not release even though unconscious.  
The buddy noticed the diver's pony regulator and was able to 
release it and take a breath and release the diver's grip.  
Because his wing was inflated the buddy then made a rapid 
ascent to the surface.  On the surface he signalled the boat to 
mark the position.  The Coastguard was alerted and a surface 
search was conducted throughout the remainder of the day and 
for a number of days after the incident but no sign of the 
missing diver was found.  The buddy was airlifted to a 
recompression chamber where he received recompression 
treatment. 
April 2011 11/051 
A cave diver failed to surface following a cave dive with two 
other divers.  The diver was located approximately 40m from 
the entrance to the cave in 18m of water.  She was found 
slightly tangled in line and both her cylinders were empty. The 
diver was recovered and resuscitation efforts were made but 
the diver did not recover. (Media report). 
April 2011 11/054 
A group of four divers entered the water for a deep dive using 
trimix at an inland site.  One of the divers is reported to have 
suffered a fit at a depth of 50m.   At a depth of 25m the casualty 
did not have his regulator in place.   His buddy brought him to 
the surface and raised the alarm.  Resuscitation techniques 
were applied but the diver did not survive.  A media report of the 
coroner's inquest stated that one of his regulators was 'set to a 
lower level than normal' and that his dive computer had not 
been correctly set up, but it was not certain that these errors 
caused the incident.  The immediate cause of death was 
reported as gas and air in the circulation.  In addition there was 
lung damage due to an uncontrolled ascent. 
June 2011 11/088 
A diver and his buddy had conducted a wreck dive to a 
maximum depth of 22m and were ascending.  As they got close 
to the surface the diver encountered a problem and his mask 
flooded. He sank back down and his buddy lifted him to the 
surface and raised the alarm.  The charter boat skipper 
manoeuvred his vessel to the divers.  The skipper noticed that 
the buddy was having difficulty supporting the unconscious 
diver on the surface and he dived in and assisted him to remove 
the diver's equipment in the water and recover him onto the 
boat using the stern lift.  Once on the boat, CPR was 
commenced and the emergency services were called.  Two 
lifeboats attended and the diver was transferred to one of the 
lifeboats and from there the diver was airlifted by helicopter to 
hospital where he later died.  Other divers in the group were 
taken to hospital for checks.  The coroner's finding was 
accidental death due to a heart condition that affected the 
casualty's breathing. 
 
July 2011 11/093 
The casualty was diving with a group of four when the current 
picked up.  The group sat on the bottom and deployed their 
delayed SMBs then began their ascent.  The group separated, 
splitting into two buddy pairs.  The casualty was with her buddy 
on ascent until they reached 5m, where her buddy remained for 
a safety stop but the casualty continued up to the surface.   
When the buddy surfaced and boarded the boat he noticed the 
casualty was not onboard, so they searched and saw her on the 
surface roughly 60m away.  She was on her back with no 
regulator in her mouth and she was unconscious. The 
Coastguard was alerted.  The casualty had no pulse and CPR 
was carried out on the vessel as it steamed back to port, the 
vessel was only 5 to 10 min away from port and the rescue 
helicopter was returning from a previous incident but was 
further away.  A medi link call was established with INM, the 
vessel was met by a first responder, Seahouses CRT also 
responded, the casualty was taken to hospital by ambulance, 
but was declared deceased on arrival. 
July 2011 11/094 
Portland Coastguard was alerted by a dive support vessel, 
reporting they had a missing diver.  Portland Coastguard tasked 
Weymouth lifeboat, rescue helicopter R106, Coastguard 
watchdog fixed wing aircraft and several other vessels.  The 
search went on for 6 hours but the diver was not located.  The 
diver was observed to have had difficulties with his gas on the 
surface and again at 9m.  The planned depth was 54m and the 
diver was using a weak mix of trimix, the buddy diver did not 
see him again.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports).  Media reports 
state that the body was found two months later, 400 miles away 
after being caught in a fishing trawl. 
September 2011 11/157 
Clyde Coastguard was alerted to a pair of divers in difficulty 
whilst on a shore dive off Wemyss Bay pier, Firth of Clyde, they 
were approx 200m out and were seen waving for assistance.  
Clyde Coastguard informed the first informant that they were 
now tasking resources to the incident, a passing vessel 
recovered the divers, one was breathing one not, Largs lifeboat 
and rescue helicopter R-177 proceeded, Cumbrae 
recompression chamber was prepared to receive the divers. 
One diver was taken to Millport hospital one to the chamber for 
treatment, the diver was declared deceased on arrival at 
hospital.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports).

Decompression Incidents 
 
October 2010 11/017 
A trainee diver completed skills on the bottom and then began 
an alternate air source ascent practice. He lost a fin during this 
skill so they returned to the bottom and replaced the fin.  On the 
second attempt at the skill the casualty failed to secure the 
AAS. He spat out his own regulator and attempted to ascend. 
The instructor held the student and put in his AAS which the 
student accepted. They made a slow ascent to the surface but 
the casualty did not breathe in or out.  At the surface he 
experienced chest pain so oxygen was administered and the 
trainee was transported to hospital for examination. 
October 2010 11/011 
Two divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 
45m. After 30 min on the bottom both divers deployed delayed 
SMBs, one of them as training practice. After successful 
deployment, both divers started to ascend together. One diver 
had difficulty dumping air from his drysuit, whilst trying to adjust 
it, he became separated from his buddy and made an ascent to 
the surface missing decompression stops. His buddy 
meanwhile experienced his computer cutting out and the screen 
going blank. As this was his only depth gauge and timing device 
he made an ascent to an estimated 5m decompression stop 
and also had to estimate the time. The charter boat made a call 
to the Coastguard to report the diver who had made a fast 
ascent and had missed decompression stops and a helicopter 
was tasked. The helicopter airlifted both divers to a 
recompression chamber where they received treatment. 
(Coastguard report). 
October 2010 11/224 
Clyde Coastguard was alerted to a diver suffering from 
dizziness, visual disturbances and tingling, a medical link call 
was established with a diving doctor who recommended that the 
diver be transferred to a recompression chamber for treatment, 
rescue helicopter R-100 recovered the diver, Oban CRT 
prepared the HLS.  (Coastguard report). 
October 2010 11/225 
Stornoway Coastguard received a call from a dive boat, 
alongside Kallin Harbour North Uist, stating that they had a 21 
yr old male with DCI.  After consultation with ARI dive doctor, 
casualty evacuated to the re-compression chamber at 
Dunstaffnage by Coastguard helicopter R-100, Coastguard 
team from Benbecular assisted.  (Coastguard report). 
October 2010 11/015 
Liverpool Coastguard received a 999 call from a group diving at 
an inland site reporting that one of them was experiencing 
symptoms of DCI after exiting the water.  Wasdale MRT 
assisted the group at the dive site until the diver was airlifted by 
helimed 516B to Murryfield recompression chamber. Hoylake 
CRT assisted helimed at the landing site at Murryfield chamber.  
(Coastguard report). 
October 2010 11/014 
Three divers were conducting a shore dive from a harbour wall.  
After an uneventful dive to a maximum depth of 16m for 30 min, 
one of the divers signalled that he was feeling dizzy.  The group 
made a slow controlled ascent to the surface. On surfacing the 
diver complained of feeling dizzy again and his buddy noticed 
that his eyes could not maintain focus and were rolling. The 
leader of the dive made a distress signal to the shore cover and 
began towing the diver to shore.  The shore cover responded 
and took over the tow.  On recovering the divers ashore the 
injured diver was assisted from the water and was able to walk 
with support.  The diver was laid flat and oxygen was 
administered and the dive manager went to call a hyperbaric 
chamber for advice. The dive manager was advised to call the 
Coastguard and request a helicopter evacuation to the chamber 
which was done. The diver and his buddy were airlifted to a 
chamber where the diver received a 6 hour treatment initially 
followed by two further 2 hour treatments. 
October 2010 11/384 
A diver completed a dive to 21m, once back on land he 
collapsed.  Oxygen was administered and the emergency 
services were alerted.  He was advised that he was fit to go 
home.  On the way home he experienced tingling in his legs.  
Oxygen was administered again and he was transported to 
hospital where it was decided he needed recompression 
treatment for DCI. 
November 2010 11/229 
Clyde Coastguard was alerted to a diver suffering from 
suspected DCI following a dive to 27m, the diver had been shell 
fishing and had a collection bag attached to his person, the clip 
broke causing the diver to make an uncontrolled ascent to the 
surface. The symptoms of DCI manifested whilst the diver was 
making his way home. On reaching home the diver was 
arrested by the police for an unrelated matter, whilst in police 
custody the diver was seen by a police doctor, he contacted 
Aberdeen Hospital who requested the diver be transported to 
Millbrook chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard report).

January 2011 11/233 
Clyde Coastguard received a call from a dive boat reporting 
they had a diver onboard who had suffered a rapid ascent from 
a shallow dive.  The diver was suffering from what may or may 
not have been symptoms of DCI, so medical advice from a dive 
doctor was that they should be seen at hospital before being 
referred to a hyperbaric chamber.  The boat had already 
returned ashore and had an ambulance in attendance, but 
rescue helicopter R-177 from Kinloss had already been tasked, 

 NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2011   
so the helicopter airlifted the diver to hospital in Oban for 
assessment. Cumbrae and Oban CRTs were tasked to assist 
with the helicopter at the port and hospital.  The diver was 
subsequently transferred to the hyperbaric chamber at 
Dunstaffnage for precautionary treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
February 2011 11/235 
Clyde Coastguard was alerted by a dive support vessel 
reporting having a diver aboard who was suffering from 
suspected DCI following a dive to 33m, the dive computer 
showed he had missed 14 min of stops, it was subsequently 
discovered he had missed 60 min of stops. The diver was 
transferred to Largs lifeboat and transferred by ambulance to 
Millport chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
March 2011 11/221 
Clyde Coastguard received a call from a dive boat reporting 
they had a diver onboard who was suffering from symptoms of 
DCI; the diver was being administered oxygen.  Clyde 
Coastguard tasked Navy helicopter R-177  and Islay lifeboat to 
assist, the casualty was transferred to the lifeboat and winched 
into the helicopter for onward transportation to Aberdeen Royal 
Infirmary.  (Coastguard report).  According to a media report, 
rigging on the boat prevented the diver from being lifted directly 
from the dive vessel. 
March 2011 11/028 
A diver participated in a mixed gas training course over three 
days.  He conducted a single dive each day with depths and 
times of 6m for 68 min, 49m for 59 min and 57m for 61 min.  
The diver experienced a leaking drysuit on all dives and 
reported being wet and cold on each day.  During the night after 
the first day's diving he awoke and felt a tingling in the fingers of 
his right hand but attributed this to lying on the arm and turned 
over and went back to sleep.  There was no repeat of the 
tingling the next day or during the next two dives. Following the 
final dive of the course, during the written exam, the diver again 
experienced tingling in the fingers of his right hand, which 
progressed to the hand and became increasingly 
uncomfortable.  The diver did not mention this to anyone at the 
time.  After the course the diver left with his buddy to drive 
home but, after an hour, his hand became increasingly more 
painful and uncomfortable.  He advised his buddy, who was 
driving, and he breathed a nitrox 70 mix while they continued 
their journey.  A hyperbaric centre was contacted and they 
advised attending the nearest A&E.  On attending A&E the 
diver was laid down and given oxygen and a saline solution; his 
symptoms diminished to a tingling in the fingers after 15 min. 
After 90 min the diver left hospital to travel to a recompression 
chamber breathing nitrox 70. The nitrox ran out shortly after 
leaving and the pain returned.  On arrival at the recompression 
chamber the diver was assessed and received a 5.5 hour 
treatment in a chamber during which the pain came and went.  
The next day a further treatment of 1.5 hours was given after 
which the diver was discharged and advised to take ibuprofen. 
March 2011 11/388 
A diver was engaged in a training course and he conducted four 
dives per day over a weekend.  On Sunday evening he felt pain, 
swelling and weakness in his right hand, and felt generally 
unwell. The symptoms were still evident on the following 
Thursday at which time he went to a hyperbaric physician.  DCI 
was diagnosed and he was given recompression treatment.  
The casualty was advised not to dive for four weeks. 
March 2011 11/190 
Two divers had completed two dives the previous day.  The 
divers descended to a depth of 20m without any problems.  
After approximately 25 min, one of the divers started to ascend 
quickly.  His buddy grabbed hold of him and dumped all the air 
out of his own suit and BCD and then dumped all the diver's air; 
he assumed that the diver had lost a weight out his BCD.  The 
buddy got the diver to grab hold of a large rock whilst he did a 
search of the immediate area for the missing weight but could 
not find it in the reduced visibility of 1 to 2m.  The buddy then 
collected some rocks to try and compensate for the lost weight 
and then deployed his delayed SMB.  Both divers started an 
ascent but the diver must have lost his other weights and he 
started to ascend rapidly.  His buddy tried to grab him but could 
not hold on.  The diver ascended and became tangled in the 
delayed SMB line.  The buddy started to make a normal ascent 
but then also became trapped in the line and was unable to 
complete any safety stops.  Once recovered into the boat, the 
diver was placed on oxygen and then, back on shore where 
more oxygen became available, the buddy was also placed on 
oxygen until both oxygen supplies were depleted.  Neither diver 
displayed any symptoms of DCI at that time.  The following day 
both divers felt bad and contact was made with a 
recompression chamber for advice.  Initially no action was 
taken but, when the divers' condition did not improve, both 
divers were advised to attend the chamber for assessment and 
received recompression treatment. 
March 2011 11/044 
Two divers had completed a dive to 21m for a duration of 18 
min.  They then began an ascent without visual reference to a 
depth of 10m where they planned to deploy a delayed SMB. As 
one of the divers removed his delayed SMB and reel from its 
stowage both divers sank 1 to 2m.  Then both started to re-
ascend, initially under control until reaching 8m and then both 
made a fast ascent to the surface missing a safety stop at 6m.  
Neither diver experienced any symptoms throughout the day 
and one diver did not conduct a second dive due to an 
equipment fault.  On waking the next day the diver who had not 
dived again experienced a stiffness in his neck, which 
progressed to pains in both elbows.  He contacted a local 
chamber and was asked to attend for a consultation and was 
diagnosed with DCI. 
March 2011 11/032 
A diver conducted a dive to 44m for a bottom time of 9 min and 
completed stops of 2 min at 30m, 3 min at 20m, 7 min at 16m 
and 4 min at 6m. After leaving the water the diver left his kit 
near the water's edge ready for a second dive.  On returning to 
the car park the diver felt winded in the stomach and then 
experienced 'pins and needles' in his right foot which 
progressed to both legs.  The diver was placed on oxygen and 
then transferred by helicopter to a recompression chamber.  
The diver received a 5 hour 30 min recompression treatment 
with a resolution of all symptoms. 
April 2011 11/038 
Two divers were conducting a drift dive in a deep water channel 
to a maximum depth of 34m.  One of the pair had deployed a 
delayed SMB at the start of the dive and, towards the end of the 
dive at a depth of 11m, he noticed that he was working harder 
and he stopped to switch the hand holding the delayed SMB as 
his left arm was getting tired.  As he swapped hands his legs 
began to float up and, despite righting himself and dumping air 
from the suit, he began to ascend.   His computer displayed a 
decompression requirement of 3 min at 3m but he was unable 
to control the ascent and surfaced; his computer went into error 
mode.  The diver had drifted into approximately 4 to 5m of water 
and, although the RHIB came alongside, he decided to descend 
again in an attempt to recompress.  He conducted 
approximately 10 min at 4 to 5m and then surfaced and was 
recovered to the boat.  He felt no ill effects and did not take any 
of the onboard oxygen available.  The buddy made his own

normal ascent under a delayed SMB.  Later that night the diver 
noticed a slight numbness in the little finger of his left hand but 
did not take any action at the time.  The next day the numbness 
had spread more generally to the fingers of the left hand and 
the diver called the DCI helpline and was advised to attend a 
recompression chamber where he received a 5 hour 
recompression treatment.  All symptoms had resolved by the 
next day. 
April 2011 11/042 
Three divers entered the water and descended to a maximum 
depth of 33m.  One of the divers felt uncomfortable in the dark, 
found it hard to breathe and signalled to return to the surface.  
The return route was obscured by silt they had disturbed, the 
diver was now breathing heavily, his regulator began to free 
flow and he decided to ascend directly. During his ascent he 
switched to his pony cylinder which also started to free flow.  
The diver made a faster than normal ascent to the surface and 
was picked up by a rescue boat.  His left hand felt numb, he 
was placed on oxygen and subsequently transported to a 
recompression chamber.  Following a 6 hour recompression 
treatment all problems were resolved.  The other two divers 
surfaced safely and experienced no symptoms. 
April 2011 11/240 
Clyde Coastguard coordinated the recovery of a diver suffering 
from suspected DCI following a rapid ascent from 23m; the 
diver was recovered by Largs lifeboat and met by Cumbrae 
CRT and an ambulance for onward transportation to a 
recompression chamber for treatment.  (Coastguard & RNLI 
reports). 
April 2011 11/146 
A diver had been to a maximum depth of 21m when she 
experienced a free flow from her regulator.  She did not take her 
buddy's alternate source but began an ascent directly to the 
surface.  The diver was unable to see her computer due to the 
mass of bubbles and so used the speed of the bubbles to judge 
her rate of ascent.  She was fine on the surface and her buddy 
surfaced 3 min later, some distance away.  After a surface 
interval of 1 hour 30 min the diver conducted a dive to a 
maximum depth of 8m for 25 min without incident.  Two days 
later the diver awoke with a stiff neck, lower back pain and 
some 'pins and needles' in her left hand.  Whilst getting 
dressed, the diver noted a rash on her right shoulder.  She 
called a recompression chamber and was advised to attend for 
a check-up; she received a recompression treatment. 
April 2011 11/097 
Following a first uneventful dive for a duration of 39 min, depth 
unknown, a diver was conducting a second dive of the day 4 
hours later using nitrox 25.  After 25 min of a dive to a maximum 
depth of 28m the diver deployed a delayed SMB and 
commenced his ascent.  At around 17m the diver experienced 
severe cramp in his right calf, he felt light and struggled to 
dump air.  The diver's feet were very buoyant and he struggled 
to maintain control.  At 10m he lost control and made a fast 
ascent direct to the surface.  The diver was recovered to the 
charter vessel and began to experience symptoms of DCI.  A 
call to the Coastguard was made and the diver was airlifted by 
helicopter to a recompression chamber where he received 
treatment. (Coastguard report). 
April 2011 11/081 
Following a dive to a maximum depth of 21m a buddy pair had 
returned to a depth of 13m after a duration of 17 min.  At this 
point one of the divers was unable to dump sufficient air and 
made a fast ascent to the surface.  The diver was recovered 
from the water but initially showed no ill effects and was not 
provided with oxygen.  After an hour on the surface the diver 
developed a rash around her neck but otherwise felt fine.  A 
recompression chamber was contacted for advice and the diver 
was transferred to the chamber and received a two and a half 
hour treatment. 
April 2011 11/045 
Following a first dive of the day a diver conducted a second 
dive to 31m for a duration of 19 min.  Because he had got wet 
on the previous dive the diver wore more undergarments and 
changed to a 15 ltr from a 12 ltr cylinder.  He felt heavy before 
the dive and so removed 2 kg of weight.  During the ascent from 
the dive the diver was underweight and lost control of his 
ascent at 25m; he made a fast ascent to the surface. 
Approximately 1 hour after returning to shore the diver 
complained of pains in his jaw and the Coastguard was 
contacted by the charter vessel by VHF radio. The diver was 
evacuated by helicopter to a recompression chamber where he 
received a 7 hour treatment with resolution of symptoms. 
(Coastguard and media reports). 
April 2011 11/242 
Clyde Coastguard was contacted by the duty doctor at 
Aberdeen Royal Infirmary reporting he had been contacted by a 
diving vessel with a diver onboard suffering from suspected 
DCI, in consultation with the doctor Clyde Coastguard tasked 
RN helicopter R177, to airlift the diver from Cambletown 
harbour to the hyperbaric chamber at Millport, Cambletown and 
Cumbrae Coastguard teams assisted in the transfer and 
landing of the helicopter.  (Coastguard report). 
April 2011 11/149 
A diver attended a training weekend where he conducted five 
dives over two days to no greater than 20m and with a 
maximum duration of 40 min.  The day after the diver woke 
feeling 'strange'.  He did not experience any pain but felt 
restless and anxious.  The diver contacted a recompression 
chamber and was advised to attend for assessment.  At the 
chamber the diver was found to have mild symptoms of 
headache, stiff limbs, restlessness, minor balancing issues, 
generally being slow and joint pains.  The diver was given two 
sessions of recompression treatment after which all symptoms 
had resolved. 
April 2011 11/055 
A diver conducted three dives during the day and then travelled 
home.  2 or 3 hours after the last dive the diver felt unwell but 
believed this was due to sunstroke or heatstroke as it had been 
a very hot day.  The diver then assisted in moving a heavy 
washing machine.  The diver woke the next day with a tingling 
in his legs but attributed this to his undersuit.  The following day 
the tingling was much less and had disappeared a day later.  
The diver then conducted a 6m dive for 30 min.  The following 
day the tingling had returned but again this was attributed to the 
undersuit.  One day later the tingling was still present and so 
the diver contacted a recompression chamber and he was 
advised to attend for examination by a doctor.  The diver was 
given two recompression treatments. 
April 2011 11/244 
Brixham Coastguard tasked Berry Head Coastguard to meet 
dive vessel Falcon II who had a diver onboard with possible 
decompression symptoms. Medical advice was sought from the 
DDRC, Plymouth and the casualty driven to the centre to be 
checked over by medical staff.  (Coastguard report).

Brixham Coastguard tasked Berry Head Coastguard to meet 
dive vessel who had a diver onboard with possible 
decompression symptoms. Medical advice was sought from the 
DDRC, Plymouth and the casualty driven to the centre to be 
checked over by medical staff.  (Coastguard report). 
April 2011 11/056 
Having conducted a single dive the day before, a diver 
completed a dive to a maximum depth of 18m for 32 min.  He 
and his buddy conducted a 3 min safety stop but the diver made 
a faster than normal ascent in the last 2m.  After reboarding the 
boat the diver was quiet and on enquiry reported he was feeling 
dizzy and faint.  It was initially assumed that he was suffering 
seasickness or exhaustion, having missed dinner the previous 
night, and so was monitored and checked for further symptoms.  
The diver became increasingly pale and shocked and 
complained of cold and then tingling hands and numbness.  He 
was placed on oxygen and a radio call to the Coastguard was 
made but the signal was not reliable.  The boat still had divers 
in the water and so the Coastguard tasked another boat in the 
area to assist and an RHIB arrived on site and transported the 
casualty to shore to be met by an ambulance.  The diver was 
taken by ambulance to hospital where a doctor diagnosed a 
vestibular DCI.  The diver was transferred to a recompression 
chamber.  He received a 6 hour recompression treatment, then 
was kept in hospital for observation and released the following 
evening.

Portland Coastguard was alerted by a dive support vessel 
reporting a diver suffering from suspected DCI following a dive 
to 25m, the diver was airlifted by Coastguard rescue helicopter 
R106 to the Poole landing site prepared by Poole Coastguard 
team, the diver was taken to Poole chamber for treatment.

Two divers conducted a planned decompression dive to a 
maximum depth of 30m for 40 min bottom time.  At 40 min the 
divers were at a depth of 26m, the buddy deployed her delayed 
SMB but the reel jammed and she had to release it.   The other 
diver then deployed his delayed SMB in dark conditions and 
decreasing visibility on the wreck. The two divers lost sight of 
each other.  The second diver searched for his buddy for a 
minute sweeping his torch around and then began to surface 
repeating the sweep and search at 20m and 10m.  Concerned 
that his buddy might be surfacing without a delayed SMB of her 
own, the diver decided to surface missing 7 min of required 
stops and 3 min safety stops.  The diver was recovered into the 
boat and was immediately placed onto oxygen, whilst the 
coxswain maintained a lookout for the buddy surfacing.  The 
buddy surfaced after completing 5 min of her own deco.  A VHF 
radio call was made for advice and a duty doctor advised a 
check once the boat had returned to harbour.  Once back on 
shore the diver was not suffering any symptoms but the doctor 
advised attending A&E for a full neurological assessment.  The 
diver stopped taking oxygen and an hour later, on arrival at 
A&E, he felt lightheaded and nauseous.  The diver failed the 
neurological examination, he kept falling over, and he was 
transferred by ambulance to a recompression chamber where 
he received a 5 hour recompression treatment. 
April 2011 11/049 
Following a dive on a wreck to a maximum depth of 25m a diver 
was ascending when he was unable to dump air from his suit at 
a depth of 16m;  he made a rapid ascent to the surface.  On 
recovery to the charter boat the diver displayed symptoms of 
DCI.  The Coastguard was called and a helicopter airlifted him 
to a recompression chamber where he received recompression 
treatment. 
April 2011 11/083 
Following a dive to a maximum depth of 36m for a duration of 
39 min including a 3 min stop at 6m a diver started to feel 
lightheaded.  The diver was sat down and given water.  The 
diver reported a niggle in his right triceps and, when he went to 
stand up, he lost his balance.  The diver was given oxygen and 
the niggle reduced in pain level.  A recompression facility was 
contacted for advice and advised that the diver remain on 
oxygen and attend the facility for a full assessment.  The diver 
felt better after 22 min on oxygen.  It is not known if he later 
attended the chamber. 
April 2011 11/200 
Forth Coastguard was alerted by a dive boat advising they had 
a diver having difficulty breathing aboard.   A medi-link with 
Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, after discussion between dive doctor 
and the skipper of the dive boat, the decision was made to take 
the casualty to ARI.  RAF rescue helicopter R131, Eyemouth 
Coastguard rescue team and ambulance service were tasked. 
Casualty taken to ARI.  (Coastguard).

Following a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 26m for 27 min, 
a diver experienced the current picking up.  He returned up the 
shotline and conducted a 3 min safety stop at 6m.  The diver 
was picked up by the charter boat using the lift and de-kitted.  
Approximately 5 min after de-kitting the diver experienced 'pins 
and needles' in his right forearm and numbness in his right 
hand.  This subsequently developed into 'pins and needles' and 
numbness in the rest of his right arm and shoulder.  The diver 
brought this to the attention of his buddy.  He was placed on 
oxygen and transported to a recompression chamber where he 
received a 4 hour 45 min treatment.  Symptoms cleared within 
30 min of recompression. 
May 2011 11/257 
Solent Coastguard was alerted to a diver suffering from 
suspected DCI following a dive to 48m for 96 min, the diver was 
suffering from vertigo, sickness and was not coherent.

May 2011 11/074 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 31m for a 
duration of 26 min.  After reaching their planned maximum 
depth the divers began working their way back up the reef.  At a 
depth of around 22m one of the divers indicated that she had 
50 bar remaining in her cylinder.  The dive leader signalled that 
they should ascend and deployed his delayed SMB.  During the 
ascent the pair experienced a current pushing them up the reef 
and, despite dumping air from their suits, they ascended to the 
surface faster than they should have done.  The cover boat was 
in close proximity and the dive leader signalled that they should 
re-descend with a view to conducting a safety stop.  The divers 
descended to a depth of 12m but the dive leader had not reeled 
in the loose line from his delayed SMB and this tangled in the 
propeller of the RHIB.  The coxswain lifted the engine to 
untangle it and in doing so the divers were again pulled to the 
surface.  The divers were recovered to the boat and the dive 
leader's dive computer was signalling SOS, whilst his buddy's 
computer did not show any warning.  Both divers were placed 
on oxygen, the boat returned to the shore where a local 
chamber was contacted for advice and both divers were 
subsequently transported to the chamber for assessment.  The 
dive leader showed no signs of DCI.  His buddy showed signs 
of DCI and was treated with a 4 hour 40 min recompression 
treatment with a further 2 hour treatment the next day. 
May 2011 11/064 
A diver conducted two dives in the day; the first to 17m for 62 
min with a 3 min stop at 5m and the second to 36m for 32 min 
with 2 min at 16m and 3 min at 5m.  1 hour later the diver 
complained of shoulder pain and numbness in his right hand.  
The Coastguard was called via VHF radio and the diver was 
placed on oxygen.  The Coastguard tasked a helicopter and the 
diver was airlifted to a recompression chamber where he 
received recompression treatment. (Coastguard report).

MRCC Swansea received a 999 call from a member of the 
public who had been diving at the National Diving and Activity 
Centre, Chepstow but was travelling home reporting his buddy 
suffering with signs of DCI, they were advised to return to 
NDAC for medical aid. On their return the casualty received 
medical aid and was transferred to a recompression chamber 
by ambulance.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2011 11/072 
Following a dive to a maximum depth of 15m for 40 min with a 3 
min safety stop and around 150 min surface interval, a pair of 
divers entered the water for a drift dive with a planned 
maximum dive time of 45 min at a depth of 17m.  The divers 
planned to descend and deploy a delayed SMB from the 
bottom.  Whilst his buddy was deploying the delayed SMB, one 
diver started to have problems his mask; it flooded and he was 
unable to clear it.  The diver started to become more and more 
distressed, started to panic, signalled to end the dive and 
started to ascend.  His buddy tried to control the ascent and 
was initially able to slow him down.  As the diver became more 
distressed he spat out his regulator and his buddy forced it back 
into his mouth.  The diver then grabbed onto his buddy who was 
then no longer able to control the ascent.  They both made a 
faster than normal ascent to the surface.  The buddy signalled 
the boat for assistance and he and the skipper assisted the 
diver into the boat.  After boarding the boat and removing his kit 
the diver was sick.  Both divers were placed on oxygen and the 
Coastguard was informed by the skipper.  The Coastguard 
tasked a rescue helicopter and both divers were airlifted to a 
recompression chamber where both were diagnosed with 
symptoms of DCI.  Both divers were recompressed with 
complete resolution of symptoms. 
June 2011 11/275 
MRCC Clyde received a call from the duty dive doctor at 
Aberdeen to ask them to arrange the Dunstaffnage hyperbaric 
chamber for a female diver with skin DCI.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2011 11/071 
A group of three divers entered the water for a wreck dive to a 
maximum depth of 27m.  One of the divers had worn his drysuit 
and thermal undersuit on his way out to the dive site, he was 
sweating and a little breathless before the dive and, after 
reaching the shotline, he had difficulty maintaining a vertical 
position before descending.  The three divers descended the 
shotline and then explored the wreck until one of the divers 
reached the end of his 80m reel.  At this point he noticed the 
first diver in an inverted position and starting to panic.  He 
assisted him to right himself and then the group reeled in back 
towards the shotline.  By the time they had returned to the 
shotline the diver had exhausted the gas in his 15 ltr cylinder; 
he switched to his pony and the group began their ascent.  The 
diver used up his pony cylinder during the ascent somewhere 
between 20 and 6m and then he made a fast ascent direct to 
the surface.  The diver had difficulty breathing on the surface 
but was able to inflate his own BCD and was quickly picked up 
by the boat.  The diver was given oxygen and a VHF call was 
made to the Coastguard who tasked a rescue helicopter.  The 
diver was airlifted to a recompression chamber where he 
received treatment.  The other two divers made a normal 
ascent.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2011 11/092 
A diver conducting a rebreather dive to a maximum depth of 
46m began to feel less clear headed than usual after 60 min 
into the dive. The diver ascended to 30m and became 
breathless and, suspecting a CO2 problem, bailed out onto 
open circuit trimix 11/53 and regained control of his breathing.  
The diver assessed the situation and determined that the more 
likely cause had been a new, very tight, neck seal.  He then 
switched back onto the rebreather and completed 48 min of 
required stops and an additional 3 min safety stop at 3m.  After 
a total in-water time of 122 min, the diver surfaced and exited 
onto a charter boat.  On the surface the diver developed a 
cough when taking a moderate breath but had no other 
symptoms.  The diver was advised to have a check-up with a 
local GP and was placed on oxygen.  By the time of 
consultation the cough had mostly disappeared but during 
examination red marks believed to have been skin DCIs 
appeared.  The diver was transferred to a recompression 
chamber and received a 4.5 hour recompression treatment. 
June 2011 11/277 
Shetland Coastguard received a report of a diver who had 
missed 11 min stops following a dive to 34m, the diver came to 
surface after 43 min with a max depth 35m, the diver was 
complaining of tingling on lips and he had immediately been 
placed on oxygen, the dive support vessel was met by an 
ambulance and the casualty transferred to Balfour hospital for 
treatment.  (Coastguard report).

A diver had completed a dive to a maximum depth of 28m for 
37 min and began her ascent with 2 min required 
decompression stops.  There were a large number of people on 
the shotline and a prevailing swell which resulted in the diver 
varying depths between 8m and 4m.  The diver left the shotline 
at 6m intending to deploy a delayed SMB but the swell took her 
up.  She was unable to dump air fast enough and so made a 
faster than normal ascent and missed her required 
decompression stops.  There was no oxygen available on the 
charter boat.  The diver experienced no symptoms that day or 
the next but noticed intermittent symptoms the following day.  
The diver woke the subsequent morning with 'pins and needles'.  
She contacted a diving doctor and was advised to attend a 
recompression chamber where she received recompression 
treatment. 
June 2011 11/281 
Dover Coastguard received a call from ambulance control 
stating they were taking two persons from the marina at Dover 
to hospital with suspected DCIs. They were on 100% oxygen. 
At no time was the Coastguard informed and the same type of 
incident happened before with this vessel again not calling the 
Coastguard. This is a local dive operator who does not seem to 
want to take part in any safety advice given to him on prior 
occasions.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2011 11/283 
Shetland Coastguard was alerted by a dive support vessel of a 
diver suffering from suspected DCI, the vessel brought the diver 
ashore who was met by an ambulance which transported the 
casualty to Balfour hospital for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2011 11/105 
A diver, her two buddies and an instructor conducted a number 
of dives during a training course over two days.  Day 1 dives of 
13m for 11 min, 10m for 6 min, 7m for 18 min & 6m for 15 min, 
with surface intervals of 10 min, 9 min and 1hr 15 min 
respectively.  Day 2 dives of 7m for 28 min and 9m for 21 min 
with a surface interval of 2hr 21 min.  During the final dive, the 
diver and one of her buddies ascended but lost sight of the third 
diver and instructor due to the disturbed visibility.  The pair 
ascended slowly holding each other's arms but, when they 
reached 2m, the diver let go of her buddy.  She sank back down 
to 5m before regaining control and making an ascent to the 
surface.  Her diving computer indicated no alarms.  The diver 
did not notice anything unusual until midnight after the course 
when, following a hot bath, the diver noticed patches of skin 
rashes on her abdomen.  The next day the diver contacted a 
doctor at a recompression chamber for advice and she was 
advised to attend for a precautionary recompression treatment.  
The diver reports being tired before the start of the weekend 
course and did not eat or drink much during the weekend. 
June 2011 11/089 
A diver conducted a rebreather dive to a maximum depth of 
58m.  The previous night the rebreather had been checked and 
calibrated perfectly.  During the descent for the dive an alarm 
went off indicating that a cell had failed.  The diver continued 
the descent hoping the cell would stabilise and the dive could 
continue, but repeated checking indicated no change.  Further 
checks indicated that a second cell had then failed and the 
system's voting logic resulted in the two failed cells out voting 
the working cell resulting in the oxygen levels rising above 2 
bar.  The diver signalled his buddy that he was aborting the 
dive.  During the ascent the diver remained on the rebreather 
loop believing that the ascent would cause the pO2 to fall.  At a 
 
depth of 30m the diver prepared his nitrox 50 mix ready to make 
a switch but then blacked out around this time and continued to 
make a buoyant ascent.  On the surface the diver was spotted 
by the cover RHIB and he was noted to be cyanosed and had a 
very weak pulse. The diver's kit was removed and ditched and 
the diver was recovered into the RHIB and given oxygen.  After 
about 10 min on oxygen the diver recovered consciousness.  A 
helicopter was scrambled and airlifted the diver to a 
recompression chamber where he received a 7 hour treatment 
for a neurological DCI.  The diver also suffered injury from biting 
his tongue. 
June 2011 11/112 
A dive group drove through the night arriving at a ferry port 
around 4.30 am.  One diver estimated he had managed an hour 
and a half of sleep.  Later, during the afternoon of the same 
day, the group conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 33m 
after which the diver commented to a colleague that his upper 
arms felt hot.  He put this down to the strain of lifting dive gear 
onto the boat.  The following day a dive to 32m was conducted 
after which the diver experienced a return of the heat and 
noticed blotches on his upper arms.  He did not conduct a 
second dive and took oxygen until the heat and blotches 
disappeared.  The next day he conducted two dives to a 
maximum depth of 18m without any repeat symptoms.  The 
following day he conducted dives to 36m for a total time of 35 
min and 24m for 38 min with no symptoms.  The final day the 
diver conducted a dive to 36m for a total duration of 31 min and 
a 3 min safety stop at 6m.  Approximately one and half hours 
after surfacing the diver experienced hot skin and blotches to 
his upper arms.  The skipper of the charter boat called the 
Coastguard who arranged for the boat to be met in harbour by 
an ambulance which transferred the diver to a recompression 
chamber.  The diver received a 4 hr 45 min treatment with a 
resolution of his symptoms. The diver has undergone checks 
for a PFO and been found not to have a PFO. 
June 2011 11/129 
A pair of divers became separated on a dive at a depth of 40m.  
One diver surfaced and stated that he had not conducted any 
safety stops.  His buddy surfaced a little later having completed 
his stops.  The first diver was given oxygen and water in 
addition to using nitrox 40.  The diver appeared to have mild 
DCI symptoms and so the Coastguard was notified.  The 
Coastguard took medical advice and tasked a helicopter to 
airlift the diver to a recompression chamber where he received 
a 5 hour recompression treatment and was kept in hospital 
overnight.  The next morning the diver received a further 1 hour 
treatment and was then released. 
June 2011 11/196 
A diver conducted a series of nine dives over a period of six 
days with a complete day off from diving after three days.  On 
the way home by train she started to experience tingling of the 
hands and other mild symptoms.  On return home the diver 
contacted a recompression chamber and received a series of 
recompression treatments. 
June 2011 11/294 
Dover Coastguard was alerted by a dive support vessel 
reporting they had a diver aboard suffering from possible dive 
related symptoms, initial offer to medi-link was refused, 
however this was established and the doctor recommended 
evacuation by helicopter, the casualty was given oxygen and 
fluids, the casualty and buddy were initially taken to Eastbourne 
hospital and then transferred by helicopter to the chamber in 
Chichester for treatment.  (Coastguard report).

A diver and his buddy conducted a series of four dives over two 
days. Day 1; to 26m for total dive time of 60 min, surface 
interval 2 hours 11 min, then to 25m for a total dive time of 37 
min.  Day 2; to 24m for total dive time of 27 min, surface interval 
1 hr, then to 25m for a total dive time of 34 min.  On the first 
dive of the weekend the diver reported that he had ascended to 
6m, waited for his computer to clear all decompression 
requirements and then slowly ascended to the surface.  On the 
surface his computer showed an error and was locked into 
gauge mode for the rest of the weekend, so the diver relied on 
his buddy's computer.  After the weekend the computer was 
interrogated and it was found that 4 min of required 
decompression stops had been missed.  Two days after diving, 
the diver experienced pain in the inner right arm in the vicinity of 
the elbow.  The pain became slightly more severe and radiated 
along the arm with pain and numbness.  The diver consulted 
with a recompression chamber and was advised to attend for 
assessment and he received a 6 hour recompression treatment 
with a complete resolution of symptoms. The diver was 
released and advised not to dive again for a period of six 
weeks.

Following a dive to a maximum depth of 53m and a bottom time 
of 8 min, a diver made a rapid ascent from 20m surfacing after 
a total of 29 min in the water.  He was recovered by the charter 
boat and started to display symptoms of DCI.  A call was made 
to the Coastguard.  The Coastguard tasked a rescue helicopter 
which airlifted the diver to a recompression chamber.  On arrival 
at the chamber the diver was beginning to experience paralysis 
in his legs and subsequent reports from the chamber indicated 
that he was paralysed from the chest down.  (Coastguard 
report). 
July 2011 11/174 
A diver conducted two dives in a day, 20m for 30 min including 
a 3 min safety stop at 6m followed, an hour and a half later, by 
a dive to a maximum depth of 29m.  After approximately 20 min 
the diver started his ascent and reached 20m before he started 
to descend again.  He tried inflating his drysuit but he continued 
to descend.  After further increasing the air in his drysuit the 
diver started to ascend and the rate of ascent gradually 
increased until it became too fast.  The diver was unable to 
regain control and made a fast ascent direct to the surface.  
The diver was recovered by his cover boat and placed on 
oxygen whilst the boat returned to shore.  During the return trip 
no symptoms of DCI presented.  On the drive home the diver 
experienced a pain in his left elbow and so he attended a 
hospital which referred him to a recompression chamber where 
he received recompression treatment. 
July 2011 11/162 
Following a dive to a maximum depth of 21m for a total duration 
of 36 min, a diver felt a slight tingle in her fingers, which moved 
to her arms and became an ache.  The dive had been 
uneventful but was felt to have been a little cold.  The diver was 
given oxygen; her buddy declined oxygen.

Humber Coastguard tasked Hull CG to prepare a landing site 
for rescue helicopter-131 which was airlifting a diver with 
suspected DCI to Hull chamber.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2011 11/180 
On the first dive of the day to a maximum depth of 16m a diver 
was under-weighted and aborted the dive after 10 min.  
Because of being underweight, no safety stop was possible, but 
the ascent was controlled, and not a rapid ascent.  After a 5 
hour surface interval, a second dive was undertaken to 16m.  
The dive was conducted to plan, but, although extra weights 
had been added since the first dive, the diver was still too light 
to be able to undertake a safety stop.  On the surface, the 
diver's computer showed 20 min of no stop dive time remained 
and no rapid ascent warnings were showing.  The diver did not 
show or feel any indications of DCI at the time.  Four days later 
the diver experienced numbness and 'pins and needles' in the 
left arm and hand.  A recompression chamber was contacted 
for advice and the doctor diagnosed a possible mild DCI.  The 
diver attended the chamber and received recompression 
treatment.  The diver has since been checked and cleared by a 
diving medical referee. 
July 2011 11/115 
Three divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 31m for a 
total duration of 50 min. During the ascent, one of the divers 
had difficulty in dumping air from his suit and at 13m both his 
drysuit and BCD were empty but he continued to rise.  At 
around 9m he lost all control and made a fast ascent to the 
surface, missing all decompression stops.  A second diver also 
became separated from the final diver.  The final diver 
completed all safety stops and on surfacing noticed the other 
two divers back on the charter boat.  The first diver began 
experiencing a tingling in his toes and a call was made to the 
Coastguard who tasked a rescue helicopter.  The second diver 
did not display any symptoms.  The helicopter airlifted the first 
two divers to a recompression chamber where the first diver 
received recompression treatment but the second diver was 
released without any treatment. 
July 2011 11/117 
A diver conducted two dives in a day.  The first was to 45m max 
for a bottom time of 20 min followed by stops at 27m for 2 min, 
12m for 1 min, 9m for 3 min, 6m for 2 min and 4m for 12 min; 
the stops at 6m and 4m were conducted on nitrox 67.  An 

 NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2011   
additional 2 min of stops were added at 4m to clear a computer.  
Following a 2 hour surface interval, the diver conducted a drift 
dive to a maximum depth of 24m and a bottom time of 22 min 
on air.  On returning to 6m on the ascent his computer indicated 
no stops required but he conducted a 3 min safety stop at 5m.  
Back onboard the charter boat after stowing his kit the diver 
started to feel a tingling in both hands followed by pain in his left 
arm.  The diver breathed his remaining deco gas of nitrox 67 
but the pain continued and so he switched to nitrox 80.  When 
the charter boat was alongside the harbour the skipper placed 
the diver on oxygen and called a diving doctor for advice.  The 
decision was made to airlift the diver to a recompression 
chamber where he received recompression treatment. 
(Coastguard report). 
July 2011 11/120 
A diver conducted two dives in a day; 30m for 45 min with 7 min 
of stops at 6m and, after a 3 hour surface interval, 21m for 59 
min with a 5 min stop at 6m.  Sea conditions on the first dive 
were quite rough and getting back onboard the charter boat was 
difficult.  Conditions for the second dive were easier as the 
swell had reduced a little.  The following morning the diver woke 
with no problems and went for a walk.  Later in the evening of 
the same day the diver experienced a gradual onset of pain in 
her left leg but thought she had bumped or strained it getting 
back into the boat the previous day.  The following day the leg 
had become much more painful and the diver was limping and 
she phoned a recompression chamber who advised her to 
attend for a check-up.  She was diagnosed with DCI and 
received four recompression treatments with complete 
resolution of symptoms.

Two divers conducted an uneventful dive to a maximum depth 
of 45m for a total dive time of 32 min including a 4 min stop at 
6m.  Shortly after surfacing one of the divers experienced 
severe lower back pain radiating around to his abdomen with 
burning pains down his left leg.  His balance was affected and 
he was unable to stand without assistance.  The diver was 
taken to a first aid area and given oxygen.  His pain increased 
for a short while and the diver complained of 'pins and needles' 
in both feet and a loss of mobility down his left side.  The 
emergency services were called and the diver was laid down 
whilst taking oxygen until an ambulance arrived.  The diver was 
assessed and then transferred by air ambulance to a 
recompression facility where he received recompression 
treatment for a spinal DCI.  The diver received several 
recompression treatments over several days with a good 
resolution of symptoms achieved.

Shetland Coastguard received a report from Orkney hyperbaric 
that due to a diving incident the recompression chamber in 
Stromness would be in use for the next 2.5hr  (Coastguard 
report). 
July 2011 11/208 
Falmouth Coastguard was alerted by a dive store that had a 
diver with them complaining of symptoms of DCI.  The store 
had already contacted the DDRC and received advice to 
evacuated the casualty immediately, then and only then did the 
store contact the Coastguard.  Falmouth Coastguard tasked 
rescue helicopter R193 to airlift the casualty to DDRC in 
Plymouth.  The search mission controller expressed concern 
that the dive vessel did not call in the incident, the casualty had 
surfaced and missed 5 min of stops following a 20m+ dive, the 
diver had started to complain of breathing difficulties back pain 
and numbness from rib cage downwards. 
July 2011 11/124 
A pair of divers had conducted two dives the previous day of 
36m for 38 min with a 3 min safety stop at 6m followed, 2 hours 
later, by 12m for 36 min with a 3 min safety stop.  They entered 
the water for a wall dive to a planned maximum depth of 45m 
and no longer than 45 min dive time.  The pair reached a 
maximum depth of 45m and one of the divers later reported he 
had felt "narked".  Both had become distracted by an eel they 
found at depth and, as a result, they accumulated more 
decompression penalty than they had planned.  One diver was 
using a dive computer that required deep stops whilst the 
other's computer accumulated additional time (15 min at 6m) at 
shallower depths during the deep stops they conducted.  One 
diver conducted the dive on air including all stops whilst his 
buddy switched to nitrox 50 at around 20m.  The pair conducted 
stops of 2 min at 26m, 2 min at 16m, 2 min at 11m and 15 min 
at 6m and surfaced after a total dive time of 52 min.  An hour 
after surfacing, the first diver noticed a pain in his left shoulder 
that became worse on exertion.  Oxygen was administered for 
20 min at which point the pain had disappeared.  The remaining 
divers were recovered and the boat returned to harbour.  The 
diver was advised to phone a diving accident helpline; he was 
advised to contact the Coastguard but was reluctant to do so.  
A doctor in the dive group called the Coastguard and gave the 
diver's details.  The Coastguard on contacting the diver helpline 
were told that the diver had already been advised to attend a 
chamber.  The diver was transported to a nearby chamber and 
received recompression treatment.  His buddy was monitored 
and did not display any symptoms. 
July 2011 11/182 
A diver had conducted a dive the previous day to 58m for a dive 
duration of 72 min.  On the second day the diver conducted a 
dive using a weak trimix 26/11 as bottom gas to a maximum 
depth of 44m with a bottom time of around 34 min before 
returning to the shotline for ascent.  The diver followed his 
computer for monitoring his decompression stops which 
included two deep stops.  The diver switched to nitrox 80 for his 
decompression stops at 9m and shallower.  The diver and his 
buddy surfaced after a total dive time of 70 min and reboarded 
the boat which was tied onto the shotline.  After a few minutes 
on the surface, the diver noticed that vision in his left eye had 
gone blurry as if his contact lens was very dry.  His vision 
returned when saline drops were added.  The boat returned to 
shore some 20 to 30 min later at which point the diver felt 
bruising on his left buttock having sat mainly on that side on the 
boat.  The diver also noted tinnitus and slightly blocked ears 
and he felt a little unsteady for less than a minute.  The diver 
mentioned his symptoms to his buddy and boat skipper but it 
was considered not to be DCI.  Shortly after, the diver suddenly 
noticed that his hearing had altered.  Advice was sought from 
an ENT consultant who advised that it was not a DCI.  The diver 
had perfect hearing in his left ear but was now totally deaf in his 
right ear.  Contact was made with a DCI helpline and he was 
advised to contact an ENT specialist.  Apart from the hearing 
loss the diver felt otherwise OK but used oxygen in the car 
whilst being transported to A&E.  On walking into A&E the diver 
felt unsteady and requested oxygen;  he felt better once back 
on oxygen.  The diver was transferred to a recompression 
chamber where he received three recompression treatments 
with improvements in his symptoms.  The diver has since been 
tested for a PFO and found to have a significant right to left 
shunt. 
July 2011 11/311 
Solent Coastguard was alerted by the ambulance service to a 
diver who had not been able to complete the final stage of a 
deco stop due to lack of air, the diver complained of pain in the 
shoulder spreading to the elbow and accompanied by a rash,

the diver was conveyed to shore by the dive support vessel, the 
diver was given the number of the duty diving doctor at the INM, 
the diver went to the local RNLI station and whilst doing this 
flagged down a passing ambulance, at this point the ambulance 
service contacted Solent Coastguard, some confusion ensued, 
as the DDMO had alerted the ambulance service to this diver's 
need for assistance. Finally and after considerable delay due to 
the dive vessel's failure to alert the Coastguard, the diver was 
flown to St Richards’s hospital by Coastguard helicopter for 
treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2011 11/134 
A dive charter boat made a 'Pan Pan' call for a diver who was 
experiencing chest pains shortly after what was reported as a 
dive with no problems.  The Coastguard arranged for a rescue 
helicopter to transfer the casualty to a hospital A&E for checks.  
The hospital referred the diver to a local chamber once it 
became apparent that the diver had in fact lost his weightbelt at 
a depth of 5m and made a rapid ascent to the surface whilst 
holding his breath. (Coastguard report). 
August 2011 11/135 
A diver conducted two dives; 29m for 43 min and, after a 
surface interval of 2 hours 20 min, 23m for 42 min with a safety 
stop of 3 min at 6m.  Approximately 5 min after reboarding the 
charter boat and securing his equipment the diver experienced 
a severe pain in his left shoulder.  The diver was placed on 
oxygen and the pain subsided within 10 min.  A call was made 
to the Coastguard and the diver was evacuated by helicopter to 
a recompression chamber where he was found to have a skin 
DCI on his back and stomach; he received a 7 hour 
recompression treatment. (Coastguard report). 
August 2011 11/209 
A diver surfaced following a 21m wreck dive with a total dive 
duration of 42 min.  The diver complained of major head pains 
before becoming dizzy and losing consciousness.  The diver 
was given oxygen, taken back to harbour and airlifted to a 
recompression chamber where he received treatment. 
August 2011 11/183 
A diver conducted two dives; to 29m for 43 min with a 3 min 
safety stop at 5m and, after a surface interval of 2 hr 30 min, to 
24m for a total time of 42 min.  Shortly after surfacing the diver 
complained of pain in his right shoulder.  He sat for a while to 
see if it would ease but, when it didn't, he was laid down and 
given oxygen.  The pain began to subside, the Coastguard was 
contacted and, after consultation with a diving doctor, a 
helicopter was tasked to airlift the diver to a recompression 
chamber.  On arrival at the chamber the diver was found to 
have signs of skin rashes to his back and chest.  The diver 
received a 6 hr recompression treatment followed by three 90 
min treatments over the next three days. 
August 2011 11/398 
A trainee was engaged in a deep dive course.  He dived to a 
maximum depth of 22m and then reached 50 bar at 19m.  The 
instructor, the trainee and another diver started to ascend when 
the trainee made a buoyant ascent straight to the surface.  No 
symptoms were apparent during the day, however the trainee 
felt a weakness and tingling in his feet the next morning.  He 
rang the local recompression chamber and was admitted for 
two treatments. 
August 2011 11/138 
Following a dive to a maximum depth of 37m for a total duration 
of 26 min including 3 min at 5m safety stop, a diver complained 
that she did not feel right.  She was given oxygen and after 2 
min showed no improvement and so was escorted to the 
wheelhouse where the Coastguard was notified and the diver 
assessed.  The diver was given fluids and continued on oxygen.  
The Coastguard tasked a helicopter to airlift the diver to a 
recompression chamber where she received two recompression 
treatments.  The diver was subsequently transferred by air 
ambulance to a larger chamber for further treatment for a spinal 
DCI. 
August 2011 11/212 
On the fifth day of an expedition and after three consecutive 
days of diving, a diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 
25m for a total duration of 43 min.  A few minutes after getting 
back into the RHIB the diver started feeling unwell with 
symptoms of dizziness and blurred vision . The diver was given 
oxygen and shortly after further symptoms began - nausea, 
tingling in hands and feet and shivering.  The diver was laid 
down and continued on oxygen whilst the Coastguard was 
called.  A helicopter was launched and the diver was taken 
back to harbour from where he was airlifted to a recompression 
chamber and received a 6 hour recompression treatment.  The 
diver had been cold during the dive.  The diver had been on the 
same expedition that experienced contaminated air from a 
compressor in Incident No. 11/197. 
August 2011 11/318 
Stornoway Coastguard received a call from Ullapool health 
centre requesting the evacuation of a 31 yr old male exhibiting 
signs of DCI. Coastguard helo R-100, re-assigned from training, 
evacuated the casualty to Dunstaffnage re-compression 
chamber, Ullapool CRT in attendance.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2011 11/198 
A diver conducted two dives in a day as part of a warm-up for a 
planned dive trip.  The diver had suffered from a blood infection 
recently that had affected his left leg and prevented him from 
taking much exercise.  The diver and his two buddies 
conducted uneventful dives to 19m for 38 min with a 3 min 
safety stop at 5m and, after a surface interval of 1 hr 25 min, to 
18m for 42 min with a 4 min safety stop at 5m.  Both dives were 
described as quite energetic with the divers covering a lot of 
ground before surfacing.  Shortly after the second dive the diver 
felt lethargic and found it tiring removing equipment and stowing 
it away. The diver sat in his car to rest and had a sensation of 
'pins and needles' in his left leg.  He advised colleagues in the 
dive party, was taken to the on-site dive centre, put on oxygen 
and given water to drink.  A paramedic was called.  After tests 
the diver was advised to attend a recompression chamber for 
further tests and he was transferred by air ambulance.  At the 
recompression chamber further tests were carried out and it 
was noted that the strength in the diver's right leg was weaker 
than his left.  The diver received recompression treatment and 
was kept in hospital overnight for observation.  The assessment 
was that the diver had suffered a transient DCI as a result of a 
lack of fitness and exertion during the dive.  He was advised not 
to dive again until further medical assessment was made and 
the problem with his left leg had fully resolved. 
August 2011 11/319 
Yarmouth Coastguard received a call from a dive RHIB 
reporting a diver aboard who was suffering from signs and 
symptoms of DCI, following a medi-link call the vessel was met

Following a dive to a maximum depth of 22m for a total dive 
time of 45 min including 4 min of stops at 6m, a diver 
complained of 'pins and needles' in stomach, legs and back.  
The diver was laid down, given oxygen and the Coastguard was 
contacted.  The diver was airlifted to a recompression chamber 
where he received an 8 hr recompression treatment followed by 
a 2 hr treatment the following day with complete resolution of 
symptoms. 
August 2011 11/140 
A party of divers were conducting a wreck dive at a depth of 
28m.  One of the group experienced restricted air flow from his 
main regulator even though his computer indicated that he had 
plenty of gas.  He took the lead diver's alternate air source and 
aborted the dive.  The three divers ascended the shotline but, 
due to the current, they found the buoy at 13m.  The third diver 
tried to deploy her delayed SMB but could not clip it onto her 
reel.  The lead diver passed her his delayed SMB which she 
deployed successfully but, in the process, the three divers sank 
back to 19m.  In trying to regain buoyancy the three 
overcompensated and all made a fast ascent to the surface.  
On recovery to the charter boat the diver who had experienced 
restricted airflow experienced tightness in his chest and a loss 
of feeling in the big toe of his left foot.  He reported that his 
computer was giving an alarm and had locked out.  The other 
two divers did not display any symptoms.  A call was made to 
the Coastguard reporting three divers having made a rapid 
ascent.  The Coastguard scrambled a rescue helicopter which 
was quickly on scene and as it was recovering the divers a 
fourth diver from the same boat surfaced with DCI symptoms 
(Incident No. 11/211).  All four were airlifted to a recompression 
chamber where they received recompression treatment.  
(Coastguard and media reports). 
August 2011 11/211 
A diver surfaced from a wreck dive and was recovered by his 
charter boat suffering from symptoms of DCI.  A rescue 
helicopter was already on site recovering three divers from the 
same boat (Incident no. 11/140).  The diver was airlifted with 
the others to a recompression chamber where he received 
treatment.  (Coastguard and media reports). 
August 2011 11/141 
A diver conducted two dives; a wreck dive at 27m for 45 min 
with 3 min safety stop at 5m then, after a surface interval of 4 
hours, a drift dive to a maximum depth of 20m for 35 min.  
Approximately 15 min after surfacing, the diver experience pain 
in his left arm but attributed it to a muscular strain.  On return to 
port the pain had not eased and he informed the skipper.  He 
was placed on oxygen for 25 min before being airlifted by 
helicopter and transferred to a recompression chamber for 
treatment. (Coastguard report). 
August 2011 11/216 
Two divers were taken for recompression treatment.  (Media 
report). 
August 2011 11/143 
A diver conducted a series of six dives over three days.  On the 
final day he conducted dives of 21m for 43 min with a 3 min 
safety stop at 6m followed, 4 hours 35 min later, by 29m for 47 
min with a 3 min safety stop at 6m.  Around 45 to 60 min after 
the final dive the diver felt itching on his chest, shoulders and 
upper arms.  Upon examination he could see slight reddening 
of the skin on his stomach, chest, shoulders and arms.  Over 15 
to 30 min the reddening deepened and grew larger.  The diver 
reported to the charter boat skipper that he may have a skin 
DCI.  The skipper advised going onto oxygen and monitoring 
and that if the condition worsened he should contact the 
Coastguard.  The diver went on oxygen and took sips of water.  
The rash began to disappear after 30 min and the itching had 
stopped.  It was agreed to monitor for a further 2 hours and 
check for returning symptoms.  At the end of 2 hours all 
symptoms had disappeared other than a few purple blotches on 
the stomach.  The following morning all signs had disappeared. 
August 2011 11/148 
A diver and his buddy conducted four dives over two days.  On 
the second day, after a dive to 32m for 35 min including a 3 min 
safety stop at 6m and after a surface interval of 6 hours, the 
diver conducted a dive on a wreck to a maximum depth of 21m.  
At the end of the dive his buddy deployed a delayed SMB and 
the diver struggled to assist when the reel became stuck, but 
his buddy managed to free it.  The diver then began to struggle 
with his buoyancy at a depth of 16m as they were slowly 
ascending to their safety stop.  The diver lost control at 11m 
and made a faster than normal ascent.  The diver managed to 
briefly regain control at 6m but, after around 1 min, lost control 
again and ascended to the surface missing 2 min of safety stop.  
The diver did not experience any symptoms for the rest of that 
day.  The diver awoke the next day with a painful right side 
headache and felt nauseous.  As the morning progressed the 
diver felt increasing nausea and dizziness.  A recompression 
chamber was contacted and they advised the diver to attend for 
assessment.  The diver received a 4 hr 30 min recompression 
treatment with a resolution of symptoms after 60 min. 
August 2011 11/331

BCD; the instructor slowed her ascent to the surface.  At the 
surface, the trainee stated that she had had a problem 
equalizing during descent and had pain in her ear.  After 5 min 
she was able to continue.  The group descended and 
completed the dive.  That evening the trainee reported a 
potential ear perforation and said that she had skin rashes.  A 
call was made to a recompression chamber and she was 
admitted for treatment overnight. 
September 2011 11/215 
A diver had a problem with his suit and surfaced rapidly from a 
dive.  His dive boat placed him on oxygen and called the 
Coastguard for assistance.  A lifeboat was launched and 
recovered the diver to shore from where he was taken by 
ambulance to hospital for examination for DCI.  (Media report). 
September 2011 11/219 
Humber Coastguard was alerted by a dive support vessel on 
VHF radio of a diver suffering from suspected DCI following a 
rapid ascent from 12m.  Humber Coastguard placed the dive 
boat in a connect call with the INM and advice was to evacuate 
the diver.  Humber tasked RAF rescue helicopter to airlift the 
casualty to the recompression chamber in Hull, the operation 
was assisted by Seahouses and Hull CRTs.  (Coastguard 
report). 
September 2011 11/341 
Portland Coastguard received a call from the ambulance 
service requesting helicopter evacuation of a diver who was 
showing symptoms of DCI following a dive earlier in the day. 
The male was already on his way home (M4) when the 
symptoms appeared and the ambulance service had been 
alerted from a service station near Chippenham. It was decided 
that he needed specialist care in a recompression chamber. 
Coastguard rescue helicopter 106 proceeded and airlifted the 
casualty to the Poole landing site where he was met by Poole 
Coastguard rescue officers and the dive doctor. He was 
transferred to an ambulance for onward transportation to the 
recompression chamber.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2011 11/217 
A diver experienced DCI symptoms during the drive home from 
diving at an inland site.  The diver stopped at a motorway 
service station and called the emergency services.  He was 
attended by two rapid response vehicles and an ambulance 
and, after consultation with a recompression chamber, the diver 
was airlifted by a Coastguard rescue helicopter to a 
recompression chamber for treatment.  (Media report). 
September 2011 11/403 
Two students and two instructors descended by a line to 24m.  
After 5 min, one of the students felt an asthma attack coming 
on.  He signalled a problem and made to ascend.  The support 
instructor slowed his ascent.  As the support instructor and the 
troubled trainee were leaving the lead instructor and the other 
student, the lead instructor's regulator started to free flow and 
he switched to his own alternative air source.  The regulator 
stopped free flowing at 10m, so he switched back.  The student 
who had asthma was unconscious at the surface, and a rescue 
boat took him back to shore.  Resuscitation techniques were 
applied, the casualty regained consciousness and was put on 
oxygen.  The casualty was airlifted to a recompression chamber 
together with the support instructor who suffered a type 1 DCI. 
September 2011 11/346 
Solent Coastguard received a 'Pan Pan' alert from a dive vessel

Clyde Coastguard received a 999 telephone call from a dive boat 
reporting that they had an unconscious diver on the surface, 
after a dive to 16m, and other divers still in the water.  The diver 
subsequently came round when recovered to the boat.  Largs 
ILB proceeded to their assistance and medical advice was taken 
from a dive doctor at Inverclyde Royal Infirmary, who assessed it 
was not a decompression injury.  Largs ILB returned the diver to 
the marina where he was met by an ambulance and Greenock 
CRT. The diver was taken to Inverclyde Royal Infirmary for 
treatment.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
October 2010 11/007 
Two divers entered the water for a dive to a maximum depth of 
11m to check out equipment.  Approximately 10 min into the dive 
one of the divers became unresponsive and started to float 
slowly towards the surface feet first.  His buddy took control and 
righted the diver, but could not get any response although the 
diver's eyes were open and his breathing was normal. The buddy 
raised the diver from a depth of 10m using a controlled buoyant 
lift and then fully inflated the diver's jacket on the surface. The 
buddy asked the diver if he was alright and received a mumbled 
reply that he was not and he was not breathing easily. The buddy 
towed the diver to shore and shouted for help to which two divers 
on the jetty asked if this was a drill. After replying that there was 
a real problem the alarm was raised and other divers assisted 
with recovery from the water. The diver was examined by a 
nurse on site, oxygen was provided and an ambulance called. 
The diver's drysuit was removed to eliminate any restriction on 
his breathing.  At this point the diver said he was alright and 
insisted there was nothing wrong.  The diver was evacuated to 
hospital by ambulance where he was checked out and 
subsequently released. 
October 2010 11/223 
Clyde Coastguard received a call from a hospital in Stranraer 
reporting they had a diver who was complaining of symptoms 
which could be related to DCI following diving the previous day.  
Stranraer CRT assisted with transferring the diver to rescue 
helicopter R-177 who transferred him to the hyperbaric chamber 
at Millport for treatment.  Cumbrae CRT assisted at the landing 
site at Millport.   Following assessment, the diver was found to 
not to have DCI, so was released to hospital for observation.  
(Coastguard report). 
October 2010 11/018 
10 min after an uneventful dive to a maximum depth of 22m a 
diver complained of pains in her stomach and she felt that she 
needed to burp.  First aid oxygen was given for 10 min and the 
diver was advised to drink plenty of water and to watch for any 
other symptoms. 
October 2010 11/382 
The casualty was completing confined water training in a 
swimming pool when she complained of a severe headache.  
After 10 min her symptoms had not improved so oxygen was 
administered and an ambulance called.  The hospital diagnosed 
a stress related tension headache and the casualty was 
discharged.

Lifeboat launched to help diver with illness.  (RNLI report). 
October 2010 11/383 
After completing a safety stop, the instructor gave the signal to 
ascend.   One of the trainees dumped air from his BCD and 
made an uncontrolled descent to 9m.  The group made the 
ascent and, back onboard the boat, the trainee complained of 
pain in his ear.  He was advised not to dive again that day. 
Following this, the trainee contacted the centre to confirm that he 
had a perforated ear drum. 
November 2010 11/019 
During a training dive in a 4m deep swimming pool a trainee 
diver 'felt strange', 50 min into the session. After a further 5 min 
the dive was aborted as the student reported feeling jittery. The 
student reported loss of balance, problems equalising and didn't 
feel like his ears had popped.  He was dizzy, had decreased 
hearing in his right ear and weakness in limbs, the latter was 
attributed to shift work. The diver reported that he had felt 
bunged up in the morning but blew his nose and seemed alright.  
Medical advice from a chamber advised being checked out by 
GP or A&E. 
November 2010 11/020 
A diver fell over whilst fully kitted before a dive, twisting his 
ankle. He was given first aid including elevation, ice and 
bandaging but declined oxygen. The diver was diagnosed with a 
sprained ankle and swelling. 
November 2010 11/191 
Whilst preparing to enter the water for a second dive of the day a 
diver fell on a slipway whilst fully kitted.  The diver had pain in his 
left leg but, after a short rest, confirmed that he was OK and 
continued with the dive to a maximum depth of 21m for 38 min.  
The diver drove home with a moderate pain in his leg.  The leg 
subsequently bruised and became swollen and it felt as if he had 
sprained his ankle.  After two weeks the bruising and swelling 
had gone but there was still pain and so the diver went to 
hospital where an X-ray revealed a broken fibula.

A trainee diver conducted three training dives in a day without 
any problems.  The next day the trainee woke with the inside of 
his left forearm feeling numb and abnormal.  After 30 min the 
numb feeling was still present and so he sought the advice of 
another diver who recommended that he called a hyperbaric 
chamber.  The chamber advised that although they didn't think 
the description matched DCI symptoms he should attend the 
chamber for assessment.  Attendance at the chamber confirmed 
it was not DCI and the symptoms pointed to 'suit squeeze' and a 
trapped nerve in his shoulder.

A diver under training, standing fully kitted on a slipway during a 
briefing, slipped over and banged her head and face resulting in 
swollen cheek and black eye.  The diver was offered a trip to 
hospital for a check-up but she opted to continue and complete 
the course.

After returning from a dive a club RHIB was being recovered 
from the water.  Divers, still in drysuits, were taking turns to 
winch the boat onto the trailer.  One of the divers took his turn 
when the greatest load was on the winch.  After less than one

turn the diver's hands slipped off the winch handle and he fell 
forwards and was hit in the face by the winch handle as it 
recoiled. The diver suffered bruising to his face and swelling 
around his eye and he required an operation the next day.  The 
diver has since had a number of operations and it is not clear if 
he will suffer permanent damage to his sight.

Brixham Coastguard received a call from the ambulance service 
advising that they were attending a call to a female diver who 
had ingested water following her dive. Coastguard rescue team 
assistance was not required and the lady was taken to hospital 
to be treated for the effects of secondary drowning.  (Coastguard 
report). 
January 2011 11/024 
Two divers surfaced early from a dive after they failed to find the 
target wreck.   One of the divers swam away from the shotline to 
be picked up.  The coxswain stopped the boat and put the 
engines into neutral; the diver swam to the stern of the boat.  
She passed up her camera then the diver's leg slipped behind 
the ladder and into the area of the rudder, propeller and rope-
cutter under the boat.  Due to the delay, the boat had drifted 
back onto the shotline.  The diver experienced a twisting of the 
ankle and lost her fin.  At the same time the shotline buoy 
popped up beside the diver having been torn away from the line.   
A 'Mayday' call was made for medical help whilst the diver was 
recovered from the water.  An inshore lifeboat attended the 
scene and escorted the boat back to harbour.  The diver was 
taken to hospital and released later the same day with no broken 
bones but significant tissue damage to her left ankle which has 
since required surgery to repair. 
January 2011 11/386 
An instructor was demonstrating mouth to pocket mask breathing 
on a 'casualty' as part of a rescue course.  When finishing the 
demonstration, the casualty took a gulp of water, choked and 
coughed for a moment, then grabbed hold of a landing stage. 
Upon being asked, the casualty said he felt 'woozy'.  The 
instructor then saw his eyes starting to close and took him to the 
edge of the lake where he was assisted from the water. Oxygen 
was administered and the emergency services were contacted.  
He was transferred to hospital and released the same evening. 
March 2011 11/080 
A diver preparing to dive was kneeling down on a quayside to 
clear her mask when she fell over hurting her leg.  She was 
advised to get the injury checked out at A&E. 
March 2011 11/039 
A trainee was on a try dive in a swimming pool when he was 
seen to panic, spit his regulator out of his mouth and start to 
head to the surface.  His instructor and another instructor who 
witnessed the incident both surfaced and went to his assistance.  
The trainee was complaining of pain and loss of mobility in his 
left arm.  He was removed from the pool, a 999 call was made 
and the trainee was taken to hospital by ambulance.  The trainee 
was diagnosed as having a dislocated shoulder which was 
replaced in A&E and the trainee was subsequently released from 
hospital. 
March 2011 11/077 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 20m for 25 min 
total time.  Some time after surfacing the diver reported to the 
on-site dive shop with red bloodshot eyes and the shakes.  The 
diver had no known health problems but had experienced the 
 
same condition previously but not whilst diving.  The diver was 
offered oxygen but declined. Advice was given by a doctor to 
attend A&E and the diver was transported to hospital where an 
eye examination was clear; the diver was discharged. 
April 2011 11/036 
An instructor and a trainee were returning towards shore 
following a dive on a wreck when the trainee lost a weight pouch 
causing partial loss of buoyancy control.  The instructor provided 
assistance and the trainee expended a lot of effort trying to stay 
down whilst continuing towards the shore underwater.  Both 
managed to stay down until they reached a depth of 8m when 
they lost buoyancy control and both surfaced at moderate speed.  
The trainee was unable to swim the remaining 20m to shore and 
was towed ashore by the instructor.  The trainee was then 
assisted to de-kit by the instructor and another diver and placed 
in the recovery position.  The trainee was showing signs of 
severe shock and was barely responsive and, when no 
improvement was made over a few minutes, an ambulance was 
called.  The trainee was given oxygen by the ambulance crew 
and, after some improvement, was taken to hospital for 
observation. 
April 2011 11/154 
Early during a dive to a maximum depth of 16m a diver 
experienced a headache and assumed it was due to the effects 
of the cold water.  He expected it to go away within a couple of 
minutes but it did not.  After a total dive duration of 31 min the 
diver surfaced and still had the headache; he took a single 
paracetemol with lunch.  The headache went away and so he 
conducted a second dive without incident.  Following the second 
dive the headache returned and lasted for approximately seven 
days. 
April 2011 11/058 
Following a dive to a maximum depth of 21m for 37 min with a 3 
min stop conducted at 6m a diver was assisting unloading the 
boat at the storage garage.  Lifting a cylinder from inside the 
RHIB the diver sustained a wrist tendon injury to his right arm.  
Later in the day the wrist became swollen and inflamed.  When 
the wrist was still swollen and inflamed the next day the diver 
contacted a diver's helpline for advice.  The diver was advised 
that, given the dive profile and the fact he had been using nitrox 
32 and that the injury was sustained 6 hours after diving, it was 
unlikely to be DCI and was classified as a movement injury. 
April 2011 11/189 
Brixham Coastguard tasked Berry Head Coastguard to assisted 
two shore divers, after they suffered difficulties whilst diving at 
Breakwater Beach Brixham.  The divers were checked by an 
awaiting ambulance and one taken for check up.  Torbay Inshore 
lifeboat checked the safety of other divers in the vicinity.  
(Coastguard report).   According to a media report one of the 
divers had panicked after swallowing water. 
April 2011 11/184 
An instructor, who was recovering from a cold, conducted a dive 
with a trainee.  The dive was to a maximum depth of 12m and for 
a total duration of 33 min.  The divers were at a depth of 6m, 
towards the end of the dive, when the trainee started descending 
rapidly.  The instructor followed him down to bring the trainee 
back up; he was unable to equalise but descended regardless 
and suffered a burst eardrum.  The instructor was off diving for a 
number of weeks but made a full recovery and has returned to 
diving.

A student and her instructor completed a wreck dive to a 
maximum depth of 20m for a duration of 23 min.  Following an 
uneventful dive a delayed SMB was deployed and both divers 
started to ascend.  At 12m the student lost control of her 
buoyancy and made a faster than normal ascent direct to the 
surface.  The instructor made a normal ascent and, on surfacing, 
found the student was already back in the boat.  The student 
reported feeling 'a little funny' and was placed on oxygen at 
which point she reported it made her legs feel warm.  After 
returning to shore and walking up the beach, still breathing 
oxygen, the student reported being short of breath and cold; she 
was given water and thermal protection (jacket, hat and gloves).  
The student reported feeling dizzy and the Coastguard was 
contacted for advice.  Contact was made with the duty diving 
doctor who advised that the student should be checked out at a 
recompression chamber.  The student was driven initially 
towards a local chamber but, on the advice of the diving doctor, 
they diverted to a local A&E to have the shortness of breath 
checked out.  At A&E the student was taken off oxygen and 
underwent a neurological exam which she passed and so was 
discharged. 
April 2011 11/390 
A trainee was doing a no-mask swim in a pool.  He held out his 
hand to the side of the pool to break his momentum and push 
himself off again. In doing so he received cuts to his fingers.  He 
exited the pool and bandages and plasters were applied to the 
wounds. He later slipped on the tiles and cut the same hand as 
he fell over.  He had apparently been briefed prior to the session 
about the possible safety risk of the broken tiles. 
April 2011 11/082 
A diver experienced a headache at a depth of 8m but he 
continued the dive.  At 20m the headache remained and he felt 
sick so he ascended to the surface making a 3 min 
decompression stop at 5m on the way.  Once out of the water he 
was disorientated and 'felt strange'.  He was placed on oxygen 
for 20 min.  The diver complained of back ache but reported that 
this often happens when he dives with a twin-set.  He still had 
the headache when he left the dive site but was otherwise 
recovered. 
April 2011 11/050 
Two divers entered the water to attach a new permanent shotline 
to a wreck.  One diver was using his spare rebreather for the first 
time since the previous year.  During the descent the diver was 
under-weighted but continued with the dive.  After working hard 
to tie in the new shot the divers continued the dive but the under-
weight diver still struggled to stay down.  A delayed SMB was 
deployed and a normal ascent was made without incident.  The 
diver suffered red marking to his skin from suit squeeze.  
Subsequent inspection revealed that the trim weights had not 
been fitted to the rebreather. 
April 2011 11/158 
Following an uneventful dive, a diver returned to the boat lift at 
the stern of the charter vessel.  As the diver settled onto the lift 
he placed his hand in a small cut-out on the lift.  The skipper 
operated the lift before the diver had fully settled onto it.  The 
diver's hand became trapped in the cut-out and he suffered 
multiple breaks to his thumb and hand and deep cuts to the 
hand.  The diver was given first aid by qualified first aiders in the 
group.  Once back ashore the diver was taken by ambulance to 
hospital for treatment.

Humber Coastguard tasked Cullercoats lifeboat who rescued two 
shore divers; they got into difficulty after entering the water at 
Browns Bay Tynemouth.  One casualty suffered minor head 
injuries due to the rocky nature of the area and was treated by 
the ambulance service once back at the boathouse.  Tynemouth 
life brigade were first on scene and conned the lifeboat into 
position.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
April 2011 11/121 
A diver woke with a headache and took a couple of headache 
tablets with breakfast.  The diver then took part in a dive to a 
maximum of depth of 22m for a bottom time of 36 min and a slow 
ascent to a depth of 4m where she conducted a safety stop of 3 
min before making a final ascent to the surface.  The diver 
boarded the RHIB and removed her equipment.  After around 25 
min on the surface the diver started feeling lightheaded and 
dizzy.  As the boat returned to shore she began to hyperventilate 
and she then complained of a feeling of stiffness in her legs.  
The boat was stopped and the diver removed her drysuit down to 
her waist to relieve the pressure of the seal on her neck and 
calm her breathing.  The boat returned to shore and the diver 
disembarked at which point she began hyperventilating again.  
The diver was sat down, given oxygen at a rate of 6 lt per min 
and a recompression chamber consulted for advice.  A diving 
doctor spoke to the diver and determined that the incident was 
not likely to be diving related and that oxygen would be of no 
benefit. The diver was taken off oxygen after 30 min and she 
followed advice to rest for the remainder of the day.  The 
following day the diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 
9m for 44 min without further incident. 
April 2011 11/053 
A diver was at a depth of 6m conducting a safety stop after a 
dive to a maximum depth of 35m using a rebreather. The diver 
was carrying a stage cylinder with nitrox 51; this cylinder was 
primed but turned off.  During the stop the diver touched his 
stage cylinder HP hose which exploded injuring his gloved hand.  
As the cylinder was turned off no significant gas was lost and the 
diver continued with safety stops. The hose was a short, modern, 
flexible hose 12 months old. 
April 2011 11/199 
Brixham Coastguard tasked Hope Cove Coastguard and 
Bantham lifeguards assisted south western ambulance after a 
diver accidentally shot his friend whilst spear fishing off 
Thurlestone Sands causing minor injuries to his abdomen.  The 
two divers were helped ashore by a kayaker before being 
transferred to a land ambulance.  MCA Falcon and Devon air 
ambulance were tasked but stood down before arriving on 
scene.  (Coastguard report).  A media report suggested that his 
wetsuit had saved him from serious injury. 
April 2011 11/250 
Forth Coastguard received a call from ambulance control 
advising diver with suspected diving related illness. Eyemouth 
Coastguard rescue team and Navy rescue helicopter 177 tasked. 
Casualty airlifted to ARI.  (Coastguard report). 
April 2011 11/063 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 17m for 33 
min then deployed a delayed SMB and commenced their ascent.  
At approximately 8m one diver was unable to dump sufficient air 
and ascended quickly to 4m before regaining control and re-
descending to 6m to conduct a 3 min safety stop.  During the 
stop the diver had to work hard to maintain the stop depth as he 
was positively buoyant.  The diver then took 40 seconds to 
ascend from 5m to the surface.  His buddy ascended at a normal

rate.  On the surface the diver was lying on his back trying to 
inflate his drysuit but was otherwise unresponsive.  After being 
asked if he was OK by his buddy several times the diver 
removed his regulator and spat out what appeared to be blood.  
The buddy immediately signalled distress to the boat and both 
divers were recovered to the boat.  The diver was coughing up 
bloody sputum.  The Coastguard was contacted by VHF radio 
and a link call made with a doctor at a recompression chamber.  
The divers returned to shore to be met by an ambulance which 
transported the diver to a recompression chamber.  The diver 
was assessed by a doctor at the chamber and it was determined 
that he was not suffering from a diving related injury that would 
require recompression therapy.  The diver was transferred to 
hospital for further investigation.  After review of test results the 
diver was discharged later the same day. 
May 2011 11/192 
A diver preparing to dive, wearing full equipment, bent down to 
vent air from her drysuit.  The diver lost her balance and fell 
backwards landing on her right wrist which gave her a lot of pain.  
After 5 min she felt OK and continued with the dive without 
further incident. 
May 2011 11/177 
Prior to a day's diving, a diver was carrying equipment out of a 
club van.  The diver felt a 'sting' in his back.  After a short while 
everything returned to normal and so he continued his day's 
diving and completed three dives without any problems.  Two 
days later the diver woke and felt a pain in his back and had 
problems breathing.  He attended hospital to be checked out in 
case of DCI.  The diver was given the all clear for DCI with the 
diagnosis that his discomfort was probably due to a strain from 
carrying cylinders and other lifting. 
May 2011 11/188 
A diver and his buddy entered the water for a wreck dive. On 
descending the shotline one of the divers got the rope from the 
telltale buoy wrapped around his leg and was pulled back up in 
the surface swell.  After freeing the rope the diver descended 
quickly to catch up with his buddy and, at approximately 6m, felt 
slight discomfort in his ear with no pain but slight vertigo that 
resolved quickly and he continued his descent. There were no 
further problems during the dive to 26m for a total time of 20 min 
which included a safety stop of 3 min at 6m.  No further 
symptoms were noticed during a surface interval or on a 
subsequent drift dive to a maximum of 16m.  During the drive 
home the diver noticed a slight fluid discharge from his ear.  The 
following day the diver visited his GP, was diagnosed with a 
minor perforation to his ear membrane and was prescribed 
antibiotics and advised no diving for three to four weeks.

Brixham Coastguard tasked Torbay RNLI Inshore lifeboat to 
recover an exhausted diver and returned her to Breakwater 
Beach Brixham for ambulance crew to check over.  Berry Head 
Coastguard in attendance.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
May 2011 11/122 
A diver was preparing to carry out a second dive from a charter 
boat.  Surface conditions were a "little choppy".  As the diver 
negotiated stepping onto the boat's stern lift platform to enter the 
water she caught her right fin in the lift, lost her balance and 
entered the water in an "unorthodox manner" resulting in a 
twisting of her right foot and she experienced a searing pain in 
her right ankle.  The diver initially decided to continue with the 
dive believing the cold water would help.  During the course of 
the dive it became apparent that the injury was worse than at 
first thought and the diver signalled to her buddy to abort the dive 
and to surface.  On the surface the diver indicated that she 
would need assistance to get back onboard the boat.  The foot 
and ankle were swollen and deformed and so, on return to 
shore, the diver attended a local hospital where she was 
diagnosed with a sprained ankle.  On returning home, her GP 
also diagnosed a sprained ankle.  Later in the week however the 
swelling and deformity had not improved and so she attended a 
local A&E department where she was diagnosed with a ruptured 
Achilles tendon in addition to the sprain.  The diver has since 
undergone surgery and a period of physiotherapy. 
May 2011 11/391 
After a demonstration of a giant stride entry by an instructor, a 
trainee approached the side of the pool and was about to 
complete the stride when her supporting leg gave way, resulting 
in a semi-successful entry. Although the trainee entered the 
water without hitting the side of the pool, she fell forward at an 
angle and hit the back of her head against her first stage 
regulator which left her with a 2 cm long laceration.  The casualty 
was taken to hospital and had her wound sealed with glue.  She 
planned to resume her training after a week's convalescence. 
May 2011 11/263 
Liverpool Coastguard was alerted to a diver suffering from a 
diver panic attack on surface following a dive to 32m, he was 
taken to hospital for treatment, it is thought the diver may have 
ingested water during the dive. It was thought the diver had a 
previous medical problem.  (Coastguard report). 
May 2011 11/393 
While kneeling down in the shallow part of a pool, a diver 
sustained a cut to the little finger of his left hand from a broken 
tile. The cut bled profusely and required bandaging.  He was 
taken to hospital where stitches were not deemed necessary.  
Five minutes prior to this injury he had sustained another (minor) 
cut from another broken tile.  He had been briefed twice about 
the broken tile edges. 
May 2011 11/119 
A diver conducted two dives to less than 20m and less than 45 
min each with a 2 hour surface interval in between.  The 
following day she woke to find an angry red rash on her inner 
right arm.  The diver had suffered a skin DCI two years 
previously and so phoned a diver helpline for advice.  The diver 
was advised to attend a recompression chamber to be checked 
out.  By the time of the visit to the chamber the rash had 
extended to her left arm and behind her knees and the doctor at 
the chamber diagnosed a form of contact dermatitis.  The diver 
had washed her undersuit in biological washing powder and this 
had got wet during the dive.  It was postulated that this had 
transferred chemicals to the skin.  The diver subsequently 
developed an allergic rash over her entire body that disappeared 
within a week. 
May 2011 11/070 
Two students with an instructor were conducting the final dive of 
their initial qualification course, on a wreck, at a maximum depth 
of 20m.  Shortly after leaving the wreck to swim back towards 
the shore at a depth of 18m, one of the students started to 
hyperventilate.  The instructor swam over to him arriving just as 
the student tried to spit his regulator out and start to sink, further 
adding to his panicked state.  The instructor started to bring him 
up but in doing so made a rapid ascent to 3m before dumping air 
to try and control the ascent.  The instructor dumped too much 
air and both sank back down to 18m.  The instructor once again 
tried to inflate the student's BCD but the controls would not work 
and so he lifted the student and himself on his own BCD.  The 
pair surfaced and the instructor had to orally inflate the student's 

 NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2011   
BCD.  The second student made his own controlled ascent to the 
surface. The first student was conscious and alert on the surface 
and was able to swim back to the shore unaided.  On recovery 
from the water the student was placed on oxygen and the 
instructor was given nitrox 32 to breathe as a precaution.  All 
three divers were monitored and no signs or symptoms of DCI 
were experienced.  The student suffered from asthma. 
May 2011 11/150 
During the descent onto a wreck a diver experienced problems 
clearing her ears and was unable to descend.  The diver was 
about to abort the dive when, without forcing, her ears cleared. 
The diver continued the dive to a maximum depth of 20m and a 
total duration of 40 min.  Approximately 20 min after surfacing 
the diver experienced problems with her ears and lost hearing in 
her left ear.  The diver attended the A&E department of a local 
hospital and an ENT doctor diagnosed a minor barotrauma of the 
middle ear.  The eardrum was intact and her hearing returned 
after an hour or so.  The diver subsequently had sinus and 
hearing tests; her hearing was found to be within the normal 
range. 
June 2011 11/076 
A diver completed an uneventful dive to a maximum depth of 
33m and a total duration of 34 min including safety stops.  After 
de-kitting and taking her cylinder for refilling the diver sat down to 
eat a snack and developed a cramp like pain in her left buttock.  
The diver had twisted as she sat down and she thought that this 
was the cause, but the pain quickly developed into a stitch like 
cramp in her left side which radiated rapidly towards the centre 
of her stomach. The diver quickly became doubled up in agony 
and was given nitrox 70 to breathe.  The dive site staff arrived, 
gave her oxygen and stretchered her to the on site sick bay.   An 
ambulance was sent for and the diver was assessed by centre 
staff and then the ambulance crew.  Some numbness and 'pins 
and needles' sensation was identified down her left leg and foot 
but this subsided within half an hour.  ECG and blood pressure 
tests were normal and her computer showed no alarms and a 
normal profile with all safety stops conducted.  The diver was 
advised that in twisting to sit down she had caused a spasm in 
her sciatic nerve resulting in the symptoms experienced.  She 
was advised to attend a local A&E and a doctor confirmed this 
diagnosis.  The diver was given anti-inflammatories and 
released.  The diver's own GP has since confirmed the 
diagnosis. 
June 2011 11/272 
Humber Coastguard tasked Bridlington CRT, Flamborough RNLI 
lifeboat and rescue helicopter R-128 after numerous reports of 
two shore divers in difficulties at North Landing. Both divers were 
safely out of the water as units arrived on scene, one of the 
divers was taken to Scarborough hospital as a precaution after 
swallowing water and being sick.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2011 11/073 
An RHIB was being recovered using a rope as it was not 
possible to get the towing vehicle close enough to the water.  A 
diver was beside the tow hitch when his foot stuck in the mud, he 
fell over and the jockey wheel ran over his ankle.  The diver was 
carried to a safe area, an ambulance was called and the diver 
taken to hospital.  X-rays showed no broken bones, the diver 
was released, given pain killers and told to rest with the leg 
elevated.  Soft mud is believed to have prevented more serious 
injury. 
June 2011 11/394 
A trainee diver was engaged in a training course when she 
stated that she felt a little sick. They removed the trainee's diving 
equipment, she was given a blanket and made to lie down.  An 
ambulance was called and arrived within 10 min.  No immediate 
cause for the ailment could be found and the trainee was taken 
to hospital for further tests.  She was later released from hospital 
fully recovered. 
June 2011 11/087 
Whilst assisting the pair of divers from the water following 
Incident No. 11/101 another diver in the group was hit by a 
breaker and stumbled, hitting his head on the cylinder of one of 
the other divers. The diver received first aid care for a cut to his 
head.  He was taken by ambulance to hospital to have the cut 
glued.  The divers were commended on their organisation by the 
Coastguard. 
June 2011 11/100 
A diver was bending over trying to fit his fins prior to entering the 
water for a dive on an instructor training event.  While doing so 
he collapsed forward onto his hands and knees.  The weather 
was hot, the diver was wearing a thick undersuit and he had 
walked around 20m, in full kit, to the water's edge.  The diver 
was assisted to de-kit and reported a tight chest and some 
difficulty breathing.  He felt ill and had limited responses for a 
while.  The diver had not fainted nor lost consciousness, but had 
experienced a slight loss of balance.  He suffered slight 
confusion after the event but was of a normal colour.  Shortly 
afterwards he was seen to be perspiring heavily, felt lightheaded 
and appeared close to fainting for a few minutes.  The diver was 
advised to lie down with his feet raised but was resistant to doing 
so but he agreed to lie back.  The diver was given water and 
recovered over the next 20 minutes.  He was not allowed to 
continue with the course.  The diver seemed to make a full 
recovery. 
June 2011 11/288 
Brixham Coastguard was made aware by West Country 
ambulance service that Torbay RNLI coxswain reported a diver 
on Breakwater Beach Brixham, who was suffering from renal 
colic and had a doctor in attendance. South West ambulance 
transported the diver to hospital for further treatment.  
(Coastguard report).

Forth Coastguard received a request for assistance to recover 
casualty with dislocated knee from back of Dunbar harbour to 
ambulance. Casualty was preparing to go diving, the location 
required Forth Coastguard to task Dunbar RNLI inshore lifeboat 
and Dunbar Coastguard rescue team, and the casualty was 
ferried by the lifeboat to a more accessible location for the 
Coastguard rescue team to assist into the waiting ambulance.

A diver and her buddy aborted a dive before descending due to 
surface swell.  As the pair exited the water the diver removed her 
BCD and then slipped on a rocky shoreline approximately 10m 
from the water's edge.  She fell flat on her face and suffered a 
cut to her nose and bleeding from both nostrils.  A clean towel 
was used to stem the bleeding and the diver was given oxygen 
for shock.  She was able to walk 200m back to her car.  The 
diver was taken to hospital and released the same day with

June 2011 11/160 
A diver and her buddy conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 
30m.  On ascending back to 22m the diver felt nauseous and 
had a headache.  On exiting the water, after a total dive time of 
30 min, the diver vomited.  The diver had no known health 
problems other than feeling tired after every dive and needing to 
rest and have coffee.  The diver was placed on oxygen and the 
headache cleared within 2 min.  The diver was advised not to 
dive again that day and to see a doctor to be checked over. 
June 2011 11/205 
A diver fell on rocks whilst trying to enter the water injuring his 
right leg.  The diver was assisted by an RNLI lifeboat crew who 
transported him back to harbour.  An ambulance took the diver to 
hospital where his injuries were found not to be serious. (Media 
report). 
July 2011 11/161 
During a dive to a maximum depth of 22m a diver had a panic 
attack at a depth of 21m.  His buddy took control and the pair 
completed a controlled ascent to the surface.  The buddy 
coughed up a small amount of blood but was otherwise OK.  
Both divers were checked out and found be well.  Oxygen was 
not given. 
July 2011 11/116 
A diver and his buddy travelled by RHIB to a wreck site.  
Weather was bright and sunny with a flat calm sea.  The diver 
was wearing a very tight wetsuit and was seen to have difficulty 
in putting on the jacket with attached hood.  The diver was 
sweating and hyperventilating with the struggle to fit the suit.  
The dive manager assisted the diver to kit up and tried to 
persuade the diver to take time to catch his breath, but the diver 
continued to prepare to dive.  The diver and his buddy entered 
the water and the diver was found to be under-weighted.  His 
buddy was carrying additional weights and, once these were 
placed in the diver's BCD pockets, the pair began their descent 
down the chain leading to the bow of the wreck at 12m.  At a 
depth of around 6m the diver was seen to stop moving and he 
lost contact with the chain.  He continued to drift downwards but 
away from the wreck towards deeper water. His buddy caught up 
with him and managed, with difficulty, to drag him onto the bow 
of the wreck.  The diver's eyes were wide open and staring but 
the diver was unresponsive and limp although still breathing 
shallowly and his mouthpiece retained in place.  The buddy lifted 
the diver to the surface using a controlled buoyant lift and 
signalled for assistance on the surface.  A charter boat 
responded and the diver was lifted onto the boat using the stern 
lift and placed on oxygen for around an hour.  The casualty 
subsequently recovered, vomited, had a cup of tea and was then 
transferred by RHIB back to harbour where he was relaxed but 
tired.  The diver was taken to hospital A&E for examination and 
was subsequently released having made a full recovery apart 
from a sore ear. 
July 2011 11/131 
Two days prior to the incident dive the diver and her buddy had 
attempted a dive but had to abort because she had been unable 
to clear her ears.  The diver had been recovering from a cold.  
The next day the pair completed dives to 35m and 30m taking a 
long time to descend but otherwise without incident.  On the 
incident dive the pair descended to a maximum depth of 37m 
using air; their planned bottom time was 20 min.  The buddy 
deployed a delayed SMB after 25-30 min but he became 
entangled in it and had to cut himself free.  During this activity 
the pair became separated.  The diver deployed her own delayed 
SMB and started to breathe heavily.  She had difficulty in 
inflating her delayed SMB with her octopus and used a lot of gas 
in taking 5 min to deploy it.  The diver conducted a controlled 
ascent to 20m.  At this depth she looked at her pressure gauge, 
she noted that she only had 10 bar remaining in her single 12 ltr 
cylinder and she was not carrying a pony or other backup.  The 
diver then made a rapid ascent to the surface breathing 
continually.  On the surface the diver was unable to inflate her 
BCD as she was out of gas and her BCD emergency cylinder 
had been empty prior to the dive.  The diver struggled to 
manually inflate her BCD, she did not think to release her 
weightbelt and she started to sink.  The diver was aware of her 
legs becoming entangled in her delayed SMB line and then, as 
she lost consciousness, she felt the delayed SMB line being 
pulled upwards from the surface.  The diver had been spotted by 
the surface cover in the RHIB.  The boat came alongside the 
delayed SMB and recovered her from the water unconscious, 
bleeding from her nose and with blue lips.  The diver was placed 
on oxygen and a call made to the Coastguard who tasked a 
helicopter to airlift her to a recompression chamber.  Her buddy 
made a normal ascent. 
July 2011 11/300 
Shetland Coastguard received a report from a dive support 
vessel of a diver who had a small amount of blood coming out of 
his right ear, the vessel had divers still in the water, the diver had 
no other symptoms. The vessel was met on return to port by 
Stromness CRT and a waiting ambulance; the casualty had a 
ruptured eardrum.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2011 11/130 
A diver was preparing to dive, had completed her buddy check 
and was fully kitted including fins.  She moved backwards 
waiting for other divers to enter the water, her fins became 
entangled, she lost her balance and fell backwards onto a wall.  
The diver suffered a dislocation of her left knee during the fall.  A 
paramedic who attend the site reduced the dislocation. The diver 
declined oxygen. 
July 2011 11/302 
Clyde Coastguard received a 'Pan Pan' alert from a dive support 
vessel reporting one female diver onboard with breathing 
difficulties, symptoms included breathlessness, the diver was 
placed on 100% oxygen, a medical link call was established with 
a dive doctor at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, the dive vessel was 
met by an ambulance and the casualty transferred to Inverclyde 
hospital for treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2011 11/396 
Alarm was raised at an inland dive site by a diver at the surface 
who shouted for help.  A rescue team was assembled within 
seconds and a boat was sent out to assist.  Two divers were at 
the surface, one was panicking and being helped by his buddy. 
The troubled diver was taken by boat to the shore, placed onto a 
stretcher and given oxygen.   He explained that he panicked at 
14m, surfaced, vomited and swallowed some water.  As his 
breathing was abnormal he was taken to hospital.  No symptoms 
of DCI emerged. 
July 2011 11/207 
Brixham Coastguard tasked Berry Head CRT, rescue helicopter 
from RMB Chivenor R-169 and a land ambulance attended 
Brixham harbour to meet dive vessel with a female diver with a 
possible dive related injury.  The casualty was airlifted to

Roborough airport for onward transportation to DDRC Plymouth.  
The casualty suffered back pain on vessel.  Previous history of 
back problems and unlikely to be DCI. (Coastguard report). 
July 2011 11/133 
A student was taking part in a second try dive in a swimming 
pool, having completed a similar session the previous week.  
Approximately 25 min into the session, following a controlled 
ascent from 3m to a depth of 2m, the student became distressed 
and attempted to bolt for the surface.  Her ascent was controlled 
by her instructor who then provided positive buoyancy 
immediately on surfacing.  The student appeared to faint and 
become semiconscious; the alarm was raised.  Two lifeguards 
de-kitted the student and recovered her onto the poolside.  The 
student had regained consciousness and complained of nausea, 
dizziness, headache and ear pain and was given oxygen.  All 
other divers were asked to leave the water and the swimming 
pool staff were informed of the situation.  After approximately 30 
min the student reported some improvement of symptoms 
although some dizziness, the headache and ear pain remained.  
A neuro exam was conducted and no other abnormalities were 
found.  The student was then able to get changed with 
assistance and advised to seek medical advice.  The student 
visited her GP the following day and was diagnosed with middle 
ear problems and a slightly perforated eardrum. 
July 2011 11/397 
While practicing a controlled emergency swimming ascent drill in 
the pool, a trainee signalled a problem and wanted to ascend.  At 
the surface he informed the instructor that he was experiencing 
chest pains.  He exited the water and was made to sit down.  As 
the symptoms still persisted 40 min later, an ambulance was 
called.  Paramedics stated there was no sign of a heart attack 
but took him to hospital where he underwent tests before being 
discharged. 
July 2011 11/309 
Forth Coastguard was contacted by a dive support vessel 
reporting a diver onboard with difficulty breathing. The vessel 
was just outside St Abbs, they returned to harbour where they 
were met by ambulance and first aider from St Abbs lifeboat. The 
casualty was released having recovered sufficiently.  
(Coastguard report). 
July 2011 11/155 
A diver surfaced from a wreck dive with breathing difficulties and 
was recovered by his charter boat.  A call was made to the 
Coastguard and overheard by other boats at the same site.  An 
Ocean diver, who was not diving due to the depth of the wreck, 
on one of the RHIBs, and who was a nurse offered assistance 
and transferred to the charter boat.  She found a diver lying down 
looking extremely grey, in severe respiratory distress and unable 
to complete a sentence.  The diver was not on oxygen.  The 
nurse sat the diver up and administered oxygen and within 
minutes the diver's breathing and colour improved.  By the time a 
helicopter arrived to transfer the diver to hospital he was able to 
talk in full sentences.  The diver explained that he had completed 
his decompression stops but found he was unable to stop 
coughing.  He felt that he had to surface as the coughing was 
getting worse and he missed completing a safety stop.  The diver 
had had a heart operation to fit a stent two months prior to the 
incident.  The diver had also been diving the previous day and 
had felt a bit unwell and out of breath.  When asked, the skipper 
of the charter boat said that he had not administered oxygen 
because the diver was coughing up blood and the skipper had 
been told that oxygen makes internal bleeding worse.  The nurse 
advised the skipper that oxygen must be administered to any 
unwell diver and that it would not make internal bleeding worse. 
August 2011 11/164 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 35m and a total 
duration of 21 min.  At a depth of 20m on the ascent the diver 
started having coughing fits and these continued on surfacing.  
There were signs of blood when coughing.  The diver was given 
oxygen and advised to visit hospital to be checked over.  She 
was driven to hospital by her buddy. 
August 2011 11/399 
At the end of her second dive a trainee was feeling faint at 12m. 
The instructor ascended with her at a controlled rate.   Once out 
of the water oxygen was administered.  The trainee was 
evacuated by helicopter.  It was later discovered that trainee had 
been on anxiety medication for three days prior to the incident.  
The doctor's diagnosis was anxiety and dizziness. 
August 2011 11/197 
During a week long expedition to a remote island a group of 
divers had experienced a range of adverse symptoms during and 
after diving.  The group had been using a hired portable 
compressor and had taken care to site the air intake well clear of 
the engine's exhaust and to bleed the condensate at regular 
intervals.  After returning the compressor a cylinder of gas was 
retained and sent for analysis.  The analysis found very high 
readings of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide; well above 
safe limits. 
August 2011 11/187 
A diver and her buddy had conducted a number of dives.  On the 
day of the incident the diver conducted a dive to 27m for 41 min 
including a safety stop of 3 min at 6m.   After a surface interval of 
5 hr 5 min, the pair conducted a second dive to a maximum 
depth of 18m.  They had been in the water for approximately 18 
min when the diver felt out of breath and her legs went cold.  
Within a short time the diver felt she was out of air but, on 
checking her pressure gauge, it showed she had 150 bar 
remaining.  She signalled 'out of air' to her buddy and switched 
to her pony cylinder.  Both divers signalled to ascend and the 
diver deployed a delayed SMB but required help with it, which 
was not normal; she was breathing rapidly.  The pair 
commenced an ascent but the diver was still finding it hard to 
breathe and was starting to panic.  Her buddy had to maintain a 
close eye on the diver during the ascent.  The divers managed a 
1 minute safety stop at 6m before the diver ran out of air in her 
pony and signalled her buddy who provided his octopus.  On 
taking the octopus it felt the same as the diver's main regulator 
had.  The diver realised she was in trouble as she could not get 
sufficient air from it and so she swam for the surface.  On the 
surface the diver still could not breathe properly but managed to 
inflate her BCD before becoming unconscious.  Her buddy 
surfaced with her and assisted her onto the lift of the charter 
boat.  Once recovered onto the charter boat the diver stopped 
breathing and her buddy provided CPR whilst a 'Mayday' call to 
the Coastguard was made.  After several min of CPR the diver 
vomited, started breathing again and was placed on oxygen.  
The diver recovered consciousness briefly whilst being prepared 
to be lifted into a helicopter and slipped in and out of 
consciousness whilst being transferred to hospital. The diver was 
subsequently diagnosed with a pre-existing medical condition 
which caused an immersion pulmonary oedema. 
August 2011 11/324 
Falmouth Coastguard was contacted by ambulance control 
reporting a diver who was on the beach and feeling unwell, the 
diver was examined by the ambulance crew and released.

Solent Coastguard was alerted by a dive vessel to a diver who 
had been diving to 48m for 40 min on nitrox 26. The diver had 
been doing physical work.  1.5 hours after the dive the diver 
began complaining of chest pains, was placed on oxygen, looked 
pale but no other symptoms, appeared to improve after aspirins 
had been administered by a first responder. Casualty was 
transferred to Southampton general hospital for treatment.  
(Coastguard report).

A diver was preparing to enter the water for a night dive and 
indicated to the dive manager where they were planning to go.  
As he turned to indicate the general direction he felt a sharp pain 
in his left knee and his leg gave way.  He fell to the ground, on 
his back, in full diving kit.  The shore cover checked that he 
hadn't hit his head and helped to remove his diving equipment 
and hood.  The diver lay still for a moment or two to get his 
breath back and then stood gingerly and made his way back to 
his chalet around 50m away.  He was helped to remove his 
undersuit, elevate his leg and cold cans were applied to his knee 
and he was monitored.  The following day the diver attended 
hospital for assessment and was told he had probably torn a 
cartilage.

As a try dive session in the pool was coming to an end, a diver 
pushed his arm through the water and dislocated his shoulder.  
He was taken to hospital by ambulance.  He reported a history of 
dislocated shoulder. 
September 2011 11/194 
A diver had conducted two training dives the previous day and 
had some problems with pressure on his ears.  At the start of a 
further training dive the diver descended to a maximum depth of 
6m and aborted the dive because of the pain in his ears.  The 
diver subsequently visited his GP and was diagnosed with a 
damaged right eardrum.  The diver has been advised not to dive 
again until the damage heals. 
September 2011 11/151 
A diver felt unwell after a training dive to a maximum depth of 
15m for a total duration of 25 min.  The diver had successfully 
completed two alternate source ascents at the start of the dive 
and then gone on an exploratory dive.  After the dive the diver 
reported that he had a headache and nausea and that these had 
started during the dive at a depth of 15m.  The diver was offered 
oxygen but refused it, had some water but subsequently was 
unable to drink more.  He was continually monitored and vomited 
a number of times. The diver had previously had bad air and had 
emptied his cylinder and had it refilled.  Eventually contact was 
made with a recompression chamber which arranged a 
helicopter transfer to the chamber.  The diver was assessed but 
did not receive recompression treatment.  He was kept in 
hospital overnight for observation for what was believed to be the 
results of breathing contaminated air and was discharged the 
next day.  The diver still had a headache on discharge and had 
no appetite or energy although anti-sickness medication and 
paracetemol improved symptoms for a short while.  On returning 
home the diver did not improve and, two days later, he consulted 
with his GP who did not believe the symptoms were due to foul 
air; he referred the diver to hospital for a CT scan.  The CT scan 
confirmed that the diver had suffered a brain haemorrhage and 
he received treatment for this. 
September 2011 11/152 
30 min prior to diving a diver had taken a decongestant nasal 
spray to prevent regular sinus nosebleeds that he suffered from.  
The diver usually took a proprietary brand but on this occasion 
only had a supermarket brand available.  The diver was well 
hydrated and rested.  Due to difficulty securing the shot there 
was a significant delay between being fully kitted and entering 
the water that caused minor discomfort.  The diver conducted a 
dive to a maximum depth of 59m with a bottom time of 30 min 
and a total dive time of 83 min.  The diver was using trimix 18/45 
for a bottom gas and carried nitrox 50 and oxygen as 
decompression gases.  The diver conducted a normal ascent 
using an ascent rate of 9m per min to 48m and 6m per min to the 
planned gas switch at 21m.  At 21m the diver's buddy switched 
to nitrox 50 first followed by the diver.  Within about a minute of 
breathing nitrox 50 the diver experienced narrowing vision 
leading to tunnel vision.  He also experienced trembling of his 
fingers, hands and then his arms.  The diver felt lightheaded, felt 
he was about to pass out, felt nauseous and had a metallic taste 
and sensitive teeth, together with vertigo and dizziness.  The 
diver dropped his nitrox 50 regulator and switched back to his 
18/45 bottom mix and then informed his buddy of the problem.  
The symptoms continued for approximately a further 2 min 
before subsiding. The diver's buddy held onto him constantly 
checking for an OK signal.  After 5 min of stops at 21m the pair 
ascended to their next decompression stop at 18m.  The diver's 
symptoms had abated and he switched back to his nitrox 50 
decompression gas.  There was no recurrence of symptoms and 
the ascent continued to 6m.  At 6m the buddy switched to 
oxygen decompression gas but the diver opted to switch and 
conduct his stops at 5m to lower the pO2 breathed.  No 
symptoms were experienced.  On returning to the charter boat 
the nitrox 50 cylinder was analysed and found to contain 50.8% 
oxygen. 
September 2011 11/165 
A diver under training had had problems with his ears in a 
swimming pool where he reached a maximum depth of 4m.  
Despite this, the diver insisted on continuing with an open water 
dive and he had further problems with his ears at a maximum 
depth of 7m.  The dive was terminated after 10 min and the diver 
made a rapid ascent to the surface.  The diver complained of a 
headache and that his sinuses ached a little; he was given 
oxygen.  The diver had commented the night before that he had 
not quite got over his cold yet.

Craft towed in.  (RNLI report). 
October 2010 11/008 
A group of divers consisting of four buddy pairs were shore 
diving in tidal narrows, without boat cover, to a maximum depth 
of 10m. The drift was estimated to be 5 knots at the narrowest 
point slowing further away from the narrow channel. Two pairs 
completed their dive without any problems and left the water. 
The remaining four divers were spotted approximately half a 
mile away in mid channel and drifting in the direction of a larger 
sea loch. Sea conditions in the open loch were force five 
southerly wind, although the sheltered area of the planned dive 
had been calm. The Coastguard was contacted and a helicopter 
was tasked. The divers on shore travelled by car down either 
side of the bay and were met by Coastguard and police officers. 
The missing divers were spotted approximately two and half 
miles from their planned exit point; they had swum 
approximately half a mile to the shore from the centre of the bay 
using their delayed SMBs as flotation devices. The helicopter 
arrived and the divers were checked over by the medic onboard 
and, other than exhaustion, were found to be fine.

Solent Coastguard received a 'Mayday' call from a boat which 
had broken down, was taking on water, and drifting away from 
their divers, some of whom were on the surface, and some still 
under the water.  A 'Mayday' broadcast was made for 
assistance and the AWLB & ILB from Selsey, Littlehampton 
ILB, rescue helicopter CG 104 and the CRT from Selsey all 
proceeded immediately to their assistance.  Approximately 40 
min after the first report, the divers were picked up by a local 
boat and transferred to the AWLB, which also took the broken-
down boat in tow.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
October 2010 11/009 
Solent Coastguard received a 'Pan Pan' alert call from a dive 
boat reporting that they had recovered an SMB which had had 
its line cut, and the divers had not surfaced as expected.  Both 
lifeboats from Littlehampton, rescue helicopter CG-104 and a 
vessel which responded to the broadcast all proceeded to 
assist with a search.  However, while they were all en route, it 
was reported by the dive boat that the divers had surfaced safe 
and well and had been recovered. (Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
October 2010 11/012 
A dive RHIB with six divers onboard left harbour to dive a wreck 
16 miles along the coast. Two pairs of divers were deployed on 
the wreck and after the first pair were recovered the third buddy 
pair were dropped on the shotline to the wreck.  The middle pair 
of divers were then recovered having just surfaced.  As the 
coxswain prepared to move the boat back towards the shotline 
the engine cut out.  The engine would restart but would not 
maintain idling speed and could not be put into gear without 
stalling.  The anchor was deployed to prevent them drifting 
further from site and a DSC urgency call was made followed by 
a 'Pan Pan' call on channel 16.  A nearby fishing boat 
responded and stood by for surfacing divers.  An inshore 
lifeboat was launched and arrived on site as the last pair of 
divers surfaced.  The lifeboat recovered them and then took the 
disabled RHIB under tow.  A second inshore lifeboat was also 
launched and took over the tow, taking the disabled boat back 
to a harbour nearer to their original launch site. Subsequent 
examination of the RHIB's engine found that the spark plugs 
were defective with an increased spark gap resulting in the 
engine cutting out at low revs. 
October 2010 11/226 
Brixham Coastguard was contacted by a member of the public 
in a small RHIB at St Mary's Bay Brixham who reported by 
mobile phone a missing diver.  Diver turned up safe and well 
just prior to Torbay lifeboat proceeding. Berry Head CRT tasked 
to meet the vessel to provide advice on carrying appropriate 
communications.  (Coastguard report). 
October 2010 11/227 
MRCC Brixham made investigations regarding a dive vessel, 
with no one onboard in Plymouth Sound. The diver surfaced,

Aberdeen Coastguard received a broken call on VHF radio from 
a fishing boat reporting they had a diver who was overdue.  A 
'Mayday' broadcast was made immediately requesting 
assistance from vessels in the area.  A fishing vessel 
responded and Longhope AWLB and rescue helicopter R102 
were tasked to proceed and carry out a search.  However, 
before the helicopter and lifeboat arrived, the fishing boat 
reported that they had found the diver, about 30 min after he 
was reported missing, safe and well.  It seemed that the diver 
was not carrying a light and the boat was unable to see him 
when he surfaced as darkness was approaching.  (Coastguard 
& RNLI reports).

helicopter R-177 and St Girvan AWLB & CRT were tasked.  
However, before they were able to proceed to the scene, the 
boat reported that he had received a call from the missing 
divers who were ashore safe and well.  The divers had become 
separated and were able to make their own way ashore where 
they were seen by a member of the public who helped them to 
inform their dive boat.  (Coastguard & RNLI reports).

A pair of divers entered the water from an RHIB to conduct a 
drift dive for a maximum planned duration of 40 min.  The plan 
was to drift without markers unless the current became stronger 
than anticipated, at which point a delayed SMB was to be 
deployed.  After 29 min the divers deployed a delayed SMB and 
surfaced with a total dive time of 36 min having reached a 
maximum depth of 17m.  The RHIB was some distance away 
and did not spot the surfaced divers.  The divers initially tried 
swimming up tide and towards shore to stay within range of the 
boat but it soon became evident that this was a waste of energy 
and so they relaxed and awaited recovery.  After the planned 
maximum dive time had elapsed the RHIB began a search 
based on the GPS location of the start point of the dive and 
then notified the Coastguard who tasked two lifeboats and a 
helicopter.  The divers had been spotted from the shore by a 
team from the National Coastwatch Institute who notified one of 
the lifeboats, which in turn led the diver's RHIB to them and the 
divers were recovered safely with no ill effects.

A club RHIB was launched following a winter lay off.  The 
engine started first time and after allowing it to warm up for 5 
min, the RHIB was driven out into an estuary to check its 
operation before berthing in a marina for the season.  After a 
number of changes of direction the engine started to lose power 
and the boat was motored out of the main shipping channel.  
Once out of the main channel the engine stalled and would not 
restart.  The RHIB was anchored and checks on the engine 
made but it could not be restarted.  A call was made to the 
Coastguard and an inshore lifeboat was launched to assist.  
The lifeboat towed the stricken vessel back to the marina.  
Subsequent checks revealed water in the oil tank and 
emulsified oil in the pipe work, this was believed to have been 
caused by water entering the system when the boat filled with 
water when stored outside during the winter.

Two divers were conducting a dive at an offshore site using an 
SMB.  One diver had the SMB whilst the other was filming.  The 
boat skipper lost sight of the SMB and assumed the divers had 
drifted to the far side of a large rock so he start the boat engine 
and went to have a look.  The skipper had not realised that the 
SMB was directly alongside the side of the RHIB and, as he 
made way, the boat snagged the line and the diver was 
dragged at speed first in one direction and then another.  The 
diver released the full length of line on the reel and then

Two lifeboats launched to assist dive boat with engine 
problems.  (RNLI report). 
July 2011 11/126 
A pair of divers planned to dive together and agreed that if they 
became separated during the dive they would do a quick search 
for each other for a maximum of 10 min and then surface.  After 
deploying a shotline onto a wreck there was some evidence of a 
current on the surface but it was considered acceptable.  The 
pair entered the water some distance from the shot to allow for 
the current.  The lead diver signalled to descend and both 
commenced their descent.  The second diver was able to follow 
the lead diver's fins until he had to pause around 8m to clear his 
ears.  He then could still see bubbles and followed these until 
he lost sight of them around 18m but continued his descent to 
bottom at a depth of 32m.  The diver could see no sign of his 
buddy or the wreck and so deployed his delayed SMB and 
began searching for his buddy and noted "not much to see".  
After 13 min dive time he decided that another 5 min would "be 
a qualifying dive".  The diver surfaced after a total dive time of 
26 min.  The diver could see his cover boat but they did not 
notice him or respond to his signals of waving his delayed SMB, 
shouting and blowing his whistle.  The diver then saw the boat 
depart from the site and presumed they were searching for him 
but in the wrong direction.  The lead diver had reached the 
bottom and had to swim against the current to reach the 
shotline which was snagged in part of the wreck.  He could not 
see his buddy and so waited for 3 min and then decided to 
follow the plan and search for him for 5 to 10 min down-tide of 
the shot which took him past the bow of the wreck.  He could 
not see any bubbles and so deployed his delayed SMB and 
surfaced after conducting a safety stop and returned to the 
boat. On regaining the boat the lead diver became increasingly 
concerned for his buddy as delayed SMBs from others in the 
group appeared but the missing buddy did not surface under 
any of them.  Once all other divers in the group had been 
accounted for a search was initiated, first half a mile 
downstream of the shotline, then 1 mile upstream and finally 2 
miles downstream.  At this point it was decided to raise the 
alarm and the Coastguard was called.  The Coastguard tasked 
a lifeboat and helicopter, both of which arrived on site within 10 
min together with a number of fishing boats which had also 
responded to the distress call for a missing diver. The diver was 
located by his own boat and recovered.

Following an uneventful dive, a pair of divers deployed a 
delayed SMB which surfaced close to the original shot buoy.  
The divers had planned for around 20 min of decompression 
stops.  The divers' cover RHIB maintained the shotline and 
delayed SMB in view for a period of time.  The wind and swell 
began to pick up and the boat coxswain repositioned the RHIB 
to avoid the glare of the sun.  On completion of the manoeuvre 
the cox had lost sight of the delayed SMB.  The cox conducted 
an increasing circular search around the buoy for 20 min but 
could not relocate the divers.  The cox called the Coastguard 
and a lifeboat and helicopter were tasked to the scene.  The 
helicopter used the boat as a reference for a search and 
located the divers after around 20 min searching and directed 
the RHIB to their location.  The divers were recovered safe and 
well after being on the surface for approximately an hour.  The 
lifeboat attended and confirmed there was no medical 
assistance required.

Oscar 4 to search for a two overdue divers reported in the 
Shoalstone area of Brixham. The divers surfaced close to the 
shore as the Torbay inshore lifeboat arrived on scene.  
(Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
August 2011 11/210 
A dive boat suffered engine failure whilst it had divers down on 
a wreck.  The Coastguard was called, a lifeboat was launched 
and was on site before the divers surfaced.  The lifeboat 
located the divers' SMB and when the divers surfaced they 
were recovered onto the lifeboat.  The lifeboat then towed the 
boat back to harbour. (RNLI & media reports). 
August 2011 11/153 
An RHIB deployed a pair of divers down a shotline and then the 
cox turned the engine off to conserve fuel whilst the divers were 
down.  When the divers surfaced the engine would not restart.  
The auxiliary engine was started and used to pick up the divers.  
Due to the distance from port and an adverse tide, a call was 
made to the Coastguard who tasked an RNLI lifeboat to assist.  
The lifeboat took the RHIB under tow back to harbour.  
Subsequent investigation found the engine alternator was not 
working and the battery had discharged from previous usage.  
The engine has since been serviced and is working normally.

Ascent Incidents 
 
 
October 2010 11/010 
A diver and his buddy entered the water for a shore dive and 
descended to a maximum depth of 35m without problems. After 
3 to 4 min at this depth one of the divers became aware that he 
was rising, he dumped air from his suit but found he was 
continuing to rise; he checked to see if he had lost his weights 
but they were still in place. The diver signalled to his buddy who 
was now 4m below him and he started to dump air from his 
BCD. The diver realised that his BCD was continually filling 
faster than he could dump the air and he could not disconnect 
the hose because one hand was permanently pulling the dump 
valve. The diver ascended to the surface in approximately 20 
seconds and made his way back to shore. His buddy surfaced 
normally. The diver's computer recorded a fast ascent but the 
diver suffered no ill effects.  Inspection of the equipment 
showed a build up of material on the inflation valve that had 
held the valve open. 
October 2010 11/222 
Shetland Coastguard received a call from a dive group ashore 
reporting that one of their group had made a rapid ascent but 
was not displaying any signs or symptoms of DCI.  She was 
taken by ambulance to hospital in Houton for assessment.  
(Coastguard report). 
November 2010 11/033 
Three divers were on a training dive to a maximum depth of 
12m.  After completing training drills at the maximum depth, the 
divers ascended to 6m to complete a safety stop.  One of the 
divers was unable to stay at 6m and continued ascending 
slowly to the surface despite trying to squeeze all the remaining 
air from his suit.  The two other divers conducted a normal 
ascent and regrouped on the surface.  No ill effects were 
experienced. 
November 2010 11/228 
Shetland Coastguard received a call from a dive boat on their 
way back to harbour requesting assistance for a diver who was 
unwell following a rapid ascent.  The boat was met by an 
ambulance at the harbour, and the diver was taken to hospital 
for assessment.  (Coastguard report). 
November 2010 11/016 
A pair of divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 20m.  
During the ascent one of the divers did not dump sufficient air 
from her suit and made a fast ascent to the surface.  The other 
diver, on realising that her buddy had vanished, turned through 
360 degrees and, on looking, up saw her buddy on the surface. 
The other diver surfaced safely and the pair swam ashore.  On 
reaching the shore the dive manager was informed and the 
diver who had the fast ascent was placed on oxygen.  The 
Coastguard was contacted and, after consulting with a diving 
doctor, a helicopter was tasked and airlifted both divers to 
hospital for assessment. The diver was kept under observation 
and on oxygen for 6 hours before being discharged. 
January 2011 11/025 
Three divers made a dive to a maximum depth of 34m.  After 23 
min one diver experienced a free flow and made a fast ascent 
to the surface.  All three divers exited the water and reported 
that they were all alright.  The diver who had made the fast 
ascent was checked.  Oxygen was not given but the diver was 
advised to stay on site for 2 hours, to report back after that time 
and advised not to dive for 24 hours.  After 2 hours the diver 
was still symptom free. 
January 2011 11/387 
A diver was engaged in a deep dive training course.  At 22m, 
his regulator free flowed.  He took time to ascend, ran out of air 
at 10 to15m and had a rapid ascent to the surface.  After the 
dive, the casualty did not feel any ill effects but was given 
precautionary oxygen and was not allowed to dive again.  No 
subsequent ill effects were experienced. 
February 2011 11/023 
A pair of divers were on the second dive of the day to a 
maximum depth of 15m for a duration of 46 min when their SMB 
was pulled four times, which was the agreed signal to surface. 
The divers surfaced to be advised by the boat cover that a large 
fleet auxiliary vessel was operating in the area and permission 
to dive in the area had been rescinded. Whilst de-kitting one of 
the divers dropped his weightbelt. The diver's buddy had 
removed his own weightbelt and, as they were in only 14m, the 
diver took his buddy's belt in his hands and dropped down and 
located his own belt. Due to the silt on the bottom he was 
unable to land on the bottom and could not refit the belt due to 
thick gloves and cold fingers. The diver decided to ascend 
holding on to both weightbelts in his hands but, at around 10m, 
was unable to hold onto them. The diver dropped both belts and 
the excess buoyancy in his wing resulted in a fast ascent to the 
surface.  During the ascent the diver dumped air and flared his 
arms and legs whilst also breathing out. The diver was 
recovered into the boat but the area was not marked in their 
haste to move out of the way of the naval vessel.  The diver 
was laid down, oxygen was prepared but not used and the diver 
was monitored.  After the naval vessel had passed the area a 
search was conducted by other divers but the weightbelts were 
not located.  The extra time on the surface meant that all 
became colder than normal.  No signs or symptoms of DCI 
occurred. 
February 2011 11/234 
Clyde Coastguard was alerted by a dive support vessel of a 
diver aboard who had missed 14 min of stops, Largs lifeboat 
recovered the diver, which was met by Cumbrae CRT, the 
casualty was conveyed to Millport chamber for treatment.  
(Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
February 2011 11/078 
During a dive to a maximum depth of 20m two divers lost 
reference during the ascent and made a fast ascent from 15m.  
One of the divers reported to the on site shop feeling a little sick 
but otherwise no other symptoms were detected.  The diver was 
given oxygen and, apart from feeling cold after breathing 
oxygen, no other symptoms appeared.  The diver was advised 
to remain on site for 1 hour and then to self-monitor, to drink 
water, avoid heavy lifting and to visit A&E if any symptoms 
presented. 
March 2011 11/046 
Two divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 18m for 23 
min bottom time.  The senior diver deployed a delayed SMB 
from a depth of 15m and both divers started to ascend normally 
up to a depth of 8m where the less experienced diver began 
struggling to maintain a slow ascent rate.  The more 
experienced diver tried to assist by holding her down but 
?BSAC - 2012   35 

   NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2011 
because both divers had cold hands neither could maintain a 
positive grip.  Around 6m the inexperienced diver made an 
uncontrolled ascent to the surface without a safety stop.  Her 
buddy made a controlled ascent to the surface and both were 
recovered to their cover boat.  Both were monitored and neither 
experienced any signs or symptoms of DCI. 
March 2011 11/067 
A diver entered the water for a wreck dive with an instructor and 
another diver.  On the surface the diver felt his legs were 
buoyant but he managed to descend to the wreck at an average 
depth of 18-20m.  He reached a maximum depth of 22m when 
taking a photograph on the seabed.  The diver was very aware 
of his buoyancy but managed to maintain his depth by allowing 
some constriction through under-inflation of his suit.  As he rose 
to the top of one of the boilers he was unable to control his 
buoyancy and had to hold on to the wreck.  His buddies were 
below him and he was unable to attract their attention.  He let 
go of the boiler in an effort to regain control and made an 
ascent direct to the surface; he was unable to conduct a  safety 
stop.  His total dive duration was 11 min.  During the ascent the 
diver attempted to bleed air from his wrist cuff in addition to his 
shoulder dump valve.  On recovery into the boat the diver was 
offered oxygen but did not need it and no abnormal symptoms 
were experienced. This was the diver's fifth dive in a drysuit 
having completed a total of 45 dives. 
April 2011 11/239 
Portland Coastguard was informed of a diver who had made a 
rapid ascent at the National Diving Centre at Chepstow, 
Portland Coastguard initially tasked R-106 from Portland to 
airlift the diver to Poole hyperbaric chamber, the tasking was 
completed by helimed helicopter taking the casualty to a 
chamber near Liverpool.  (Coastguard report). 
April 2011 11/246 
Liverpool Coastguard was alerted to a diver who had started a 
normal ascent from 12m then inverted, and made a rapid 
ascent from 9m, the only symptoms were blood in mask. The 
casualty was picked up by Port Erin Isle of Man lifeboat, taken 
ashore, then taken by an ambulance to a hyperbaric chamber 
with partner.  The cylinder and computer were taken to aid the 
treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
April 2011 11/249 
Holyhead Coastguard was alerted to a diver who had made a 
rapid accent, 30 sec from 12m, the cause of the rapid ascent 
was a jammed dump valve. The diver was asymptomatic.  The 
diver was treated ashore by a paramedic who was 
administering oxygen to the casualty, The dive doctor at 
Murrayfield was linked with the paramedic to provided advice, 
the dive was 12m for 27 min.  (Coastguard report). 
April 2011 11/068 
A diver had lent his equipment to his club for a try dive event 
and, although it was not used, the BCD direct feed hose had 
been removed from the regulator for use on another regulator.  
The diver had a spare hose, which he fitted to his kit before 
carrying out a dive to a wreck to a maximum depth of 27m.  The 
dive was uneventful until the diver and his buddy started to 
ascend.  The diver put a little too much air in his BCD and 
because he had injured his thumb the previous day he was 
unable to operate the dump valve effectively using finger and 
thumb and so he relied on pulling the hose but this did not 
release sufficient gas.  The diver continued to ascend.  He 
became inverted while trying to pull the kidney dump on the 
BCD but was unable to locate it.  His buddy deployed a delayed 
SMB and the buoyant diver swam down and tried to hold on to 
the line.  He managed to hold himself at 16m for a short while.  
The diver then got tangled in the line whilst still trying to locate 
his dump valve and, with his foot tangled in the delayed SMB 
line, he made an uncontrolled ascent to the surface where he 
gave the distress signal to the cover boat.  The diver was 
recovered to the boat.  He was monitored over the next 24 
hours but showed no symptoms of DCI . 
April 2011 11/156 
Following an uneventful dive to a maximum depth of 18m an 
ascent was started after 30 min.  One of the divers had agreed 
to deploy the delayed SMB as she required the practice.  She 
was generally unhappy doing the drill and always asked 
someone else to deploy the delayed SMB.  Whilst trying to 
inflate the delayed SMB the diver lost control of her buoyancy 
and began to rise as her regulator became caught.  Her buddy 
managed to pull her back down and cleared the line and the 
delayed SMB.  When the diver deployed the delayed SMB 
again she lost buoyancy again and became entangled with the 
line around her twin-set cylinders.  She was pulled to the 
surface, in a fast ascent, without completing any safety stops.  
Her buddy made a normal ascent including completing safety 
stops and surfaced to find the diver back onboard the charter 
boat.  The diver was placed on oxygen for 10 min but did not 
display any symptoms and did not dive the following day as a 
precaution.  Further dives were conducted later in the week 
without incident. 
April 2011 11/062 
Two divers conducted a dive at an inland site to a maximum 
depth of 48m. They followed a line down to their maximum 
depth and then began making their way back up the quarry wall. 
After approximately 10 min and at a depth of 42m one of the 
divers experienced a free flow from the regulator on the left 
hand cylinder of his independent twin-set. He switched to his 
right hand cylinder.  His buddy turned off his left-hand cylinder 
and after waiting a short while turned it back on again but the 
free flow persisted.  The buddy attempted this action twice more 
without success and so he left the cylinder switched off as the 
contents were now 50 bar and the divers continued their ascent.  
At approximately 25m the diver's right-hand regulator started to 
free flow and he signalled his buddy.  The buddy provided an 
alternate source and the divers continued their ascent.  The pair 
were in close proximity and holding onto each other, as a result 
the diver who was out of gas had difficulty dumping air from his 
wing and they made a faster than normal ascent from 17m.  
The pair surfaced and the out of gas diver made his way to the 
shore whilst his buddy descended and carried out a 
decompression stop at 9m using nitrox 80.  The out of gas 
diver's computer did not display any missed decompression 
stops.  He was monitored for the rest of the day and no signs of 
DCI were experienced.  The left hand regulator was found to 
have corrosion and wear causing a high inter-stage pressure; it 
had not been serviced for 3 years.  The right hand regulator had 
the hose swapped to the opposite side of the second stage and 
the free flow lever was operated in the opposite direction. 
April 2011 11/084 
Following a first dive to a maximum depth of 22m for a duration 
of 19 min and 2 hour surface interval a diver and his buddy had 
conducted a second dive to a maximum depth of 22m.  On 
returning to a depth of 13m the diver's feet came out of his 
boots, he lost his fins and made a fast ascent to the surface.  
The diver was placed on oxygen as a precaution for 10 min but 
no symptoms were reported. 
April 2011 11/118 
A diver conducted a dive on a wreck to a maximum depth of 
28m for a total dive duration of 24 min.  At the end of the dive, 
36  ©BSAC - 2012 

 NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2011   
whilst deploying a delayed SMB, the diver felt himself rising and 
attempted to dump air from his suit, then from his BCD and then 
both.  His buddy's bubbles were beneath him and appeared to 
be adding to his buoyancy problems and he continued to rise.  
The diver vented his suit through the neck seal and felt he had 
the situation under control; he looked up to see the surface 
approaching slowly and surfaced.  The diver was recovered into 
an RHIB and given oxygen.  The diver did not display any signs 
of DCI but, on returning to shore, a doctor at a local chamber 
was consulted and the diver advised to attend the chamber for 
a thorough assessment.  After being checked the diver was 
released and allowed to continue diving the following day. 
May 2011 11/079 
A group of three divers conducted a dive to a maximum depth 
of 19m for a dive duration of 37 min.  Towards the end of the 
dive one of the divers had a problem with air migrating to the 
feet of her drysuit.  She attempted to right herself but in doing 
so one of her fins became half detached and her foot slipped 
out of her drysuit boot and started slipping inside the leg.  She 
became inverted and had an uncontrolled ascent to the surface.  
One of the other divers saw her drifting off above her and 
assumed she was dumping air from her drysuit and would rejoin 
the pair once she had done so and drew the other diver's 
attention to this.  The third diver assumed there was a problem 
and deployed his delayed SMB.  The charter boat skipper saw 
the first diver surface feet first and saw the delayed SMB 
surface about the same time.  The skipper recovered the first 
diver and, once she was onboard and de-kitted, provided her 
with oxygen.  The diver's computer had locked out due to a fast 
ascent but the diver did not display any symptoms of DCI.  The 
other two divers conducted a normal ascent, surfaced safely 
and were recovered onto the boat.  The boat returned to 
harbour whilst the first diver remained on oxygen and took 
regular sips of water.  During the return trip apart from vomiting, 
attributed to seasickness, no other symptoms appeared.  On 
return to port, the diver was transferred by ambulance to 
hospital and was maintained on oxygen for 6 hours as a 
precaution after which she was discharged. 
May 2011 11/086 
A pair of divers conducted a dive on a wreck to a maximum 
depth of 30m and then slowly worked their way back up the 
wreck.  At a depth of 14m, whilst looking at marine life, the 
divers lost sight of each other.  Both divers made underwater 
searches for the other for 2 min.  One diver then decided to 
surface and did so without noticing that his computer displayed 
1 min of decompression stops required.  He was picked up by 
the RHIB and it was found that his computer had locked out. He 
was monitored but no symptoms of DCI presented and he did 
not dive for the rest of the weekend.  His buddy surfaced shortly 
afterwards, with other divers, having competed his required 
decompression. 
May 2011 11/268 
Falmouth Coastguard received a 'Pan Pan' call from a dive 
support vessel, reporting they had two divers aboard who had 
made a rapid ascent from 10m following a dive to 23m, 
Falmouth Coastguard tasked RN rescue helicopter R193 to 
recover both divers and take them to DDRC in Plymouth for 
treatment, there were no symptoms but the divers were given 
oxygen and laid down in the boat whilst it made its way to 
Penzance.  (Coastguard report). 
June 2011 11/108 
A pair of divers had enjoyed a first dive to 12m for 34 min and, 
after a surface interval of 5hr 19 min, had a second dive to a 
maximum depth of 24 with a total duration of 30 min.  Towards  
 
the end of the dive the pair deployed a delayed SMB from a 
depth of 16m.  During the deployment the reel appeared to jam 
and the diver holding it failed to let go.  His buddy noticed this 
and held onto the diver's legs to try and slow the ascent.  Both 
divers were dragged to the surface.  On surfacing both divers 
were conscious and displayed no symptoms, both were placed 
on oxygen, as a precaution, for 45 min and monitored.  A 
casualty assessment was carried out on both divers and no 
adverse symptoms were found.  The pair continued to be 
monitored for the rest of the day and did not dive the next day.  
Further examination of the reel found that it had not jammed but 
was so tight that it could not be operated on land let alone 
under water. 
June 2011 11/280 
Stornoway Coastguard was alerted to a diver who had made a 
rapid ascent from 11m whilst on a dive to 28m, the diver was 
administered oxygen and placed in a connect call with the duty 
diving doctor at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. The diver was 
transferred to Stornoway hospital and placed under observation 
and administered oxygen, no symptoms had developed.  
(Coastguard report). 
June 2011 11/159 
10 min into a dive to a maximum depth of 20m a diver had a 
fast ascent up to 5m.  The diver reported feeling dizzy initially 
but was subsequently fine.  Both the diver and his buddy 
declined oxygen. 
June 2011 11/395 
After completing training drills a dive group went for an 
exploratory swim at a depth of between 7 and 11m.  One of the 
trainees then tugged the instructor's fin for his attention. The 
trainee signalled that she was cold and didn't want to continue.  
As the group started their ascent, the trainee spat out her 
regulator and made to rush to the surface.  Her ascent was 
slowed by the instructor.  Once at the surface, she complained 
of difficulty breathing.  She was taken to a first aid room and 
treated for shock.  The emergency services were called and the 
paramedics took her to the hospital from where she was soon 
discharged. 
June 2011 11/285 
Portland Coastguard tasked Coastguard helicopter rescue 106 
to a diver at an inland diving quarry who had made a rapid 
ascent. The helicopter was stood down as they were no longer 
needed.  (Coastguard report).

A diver and her buddy conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 
30m.  The pair made a steady ascent back up a slope to 25m.  
Her buddy noticed that the diver was slightly above and away 
from the reef and called her down.  Although the diver tried to 
descend she started to float up and ended up in a fast ascent to 
the surface after a total dive time of 21 min.   On the surface the 
diver was recovered into the boat, placed on oxygen and 
neurological tests were performed which indicated she was OK.  
Once back on shore a diver helpline was contacted and the 
diver advised to attend A&E for examination.  At A&E the diver 
was seen initially by a nurse who was unsure about diving 
related injuries and a dive doctor was called for a consultation.  
The diving doctor concluded that recompression was 
unnecessary, the diver was discharged and allowed to continue 
diving the same weekend.

A group of three divers entered the water for a dive to a planned 
maximum depth of 25m.  After 23 min the signal was given to 
commence an ascent.  Shortly after starting the ascent one of 
the divers lost sight of the others; he turned through 360 
degrees but could not find them.  The diver was anxious at 
losing control and was finning quite strenuously to ascend.  He 
added more air to his BCD but added too much and started to 
ascend too quickly with the alarm on his computer sounding.  
He started to dump air but then realised that he had run out of 
air and was still at 14m.  He tried to  activate the emergency 
cylinder on his BCD but could not open the valve and so he 
jettisoned his weightbelt and made an uncontrolled ascent to 
the surface where he was picked up and returned to shore by a 
rescue boat.  The other divers made a normal ascent to the 
surface. 
July 2011 11/111 
During a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 34m for a total 
duration of 41 min a diver lost his weightbelt which resulted in a 
partially uncontrolled ascent.  The diver managed to regain 
control during the ascent at a depth of 11m and conducted a 
normal ascent from that depth to the surface.  He did not miss 
any required decompression stops.  Once back onboard the 
boat, due to a lack of symptoms and the fact he had regained 
control of the ascent, oxygen was not administered.  However, 
the diver was made to lie flat and given a nitrox 50 
decompression gas mix to breathe during the return to shore.  
The diver did not experience any adverse symptoms and was 
given advice on what action to take should any problems occur. 
July 2011 11/297 
Solent Coastguard was alerted by a dive support vessel of two 
divers having missed stops in the final part of the dive to 33m, 
missing the last decompression stop. Solent Coastguard linked 
the vessel with a doctor at the INM; the divers declined the 
advice to be monitored at the chamber as no symptoms had 
developed.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2011 11/127 
A diver conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 43m. The 
diver was using a twin-set, where his normal equipment was a 
single cylinder.  During the descent, the diver was aware that he 
was under-weighted and he had to pull himself down the 
shotline until he became neutrally buoyant.  After 22 min he 
deployed his delayed SMB as planned despite being next to the 
shotline.  He made a fast ascent from 20m.  Once back 
onboard the charter boat the diver displayed no symptoms but 
was airlifted to a recompression chamber because of the rapid 
ascent.  The diver received a precautionary recompression 
treatment.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2011 11/181 
A diver and his buddy conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 
23m.  After approximately 32 min, with his computer showing 6 
min of no stop dive time remaining, the diver deployed a 
delayed SMB.  During deployment the reel jammed and the 
diver attempted to clear the entanglement.  Shortly afterwards 
the diver found himself in an uncontrolled ascent.  Despite 
dumping air from his BCD he was carried to the surface.  His 
total dive time was 35 min. The diver was recovered into the 
RHIB and he advised the cox of what had happened.  The diver 
was laid down and placed on oxygen.  The diver's buddy 
deployed his own delayed SMB and completed a 3 min safety 
stop at 6m and surfaced after a total dive time of 46 min.  After 
recovering all the divers the RHIB made its way back to 
harbour.  The diver was advised to seek medical advice.  He 
contacted a recompression chamber and was advised that, 
after the elapsed time with no symptoms, it was unlikely that 
any symptoms would manifest themselves but he should 
continue to monitor himself at home. 
July 2011 11/172 
A pair of divers conducted a wreck dive to a maximum depth of 
27m.  The dive followed a normal profile until they arrived back 
at 22m where a delayed SMB was deployed without problem.  
During the ascent one of the divers appeared to grab the 
delayed SMB line to help control her ascent.  The lead diver 
indicated that she should let the line run freely through a circle 
made by her finger and thumb.  The diver then ascended 
quickly to the surface without any safety stops and alerted the 
cover boat that she felt breathless and she appeared to be 
panicked.  She was recovered into the boat, placed on oxygen 
and given fluids and the Coastguard alerted.  On return to shore 
she was transported by ambulance to hospital from where she 
was subsequently discharged and advised not to dive for 48 
hours.  The diver had been using borrowed equipment including 
BCD and drysuit. 
July 2011 11/308 
Portland Coastguard was alerted by a dive support vessel of 
two divers whose computers were showing incomplete 
decompression, one of the divers began vomiting, the medical 
advice obtained from Poole recompression chamber required 
the divers to be evacuated to the chamber for treatment, 
Portland Coastguard tasked Coastguard rescue helicopter 
R106 to airlift the casualty to the HLS where it was met by 
Poole CRT and an ambulance accompanied by a dive 
specialist.  (Coastguard report). 
July 2011 11/310 
Solent Coastguard was informed of two divers who had missed 
15 min of stops following a dive to 33m, the vessel was placed 
in a connect call for diving medical advice, the doctor 
recommended the divers be seen at a recompression facility, 
the divers declined to be transferred to a chamber. The vessel 
returned to shore.  (Coastguard report). 
August 2011 11/400 
Coming up a sloping ascent, after diving to a maximum depth of 
18m, a trainee struggled to control her buoyancy. As the 
instructor and a second student tried to correct her buoyancy, 
all three went into a rapid ascent.  Upon surfacing they were 
monitored for symptoms and advised to report to the 
recompression chamber. 
August 2011 11/142 
On the second day of a weekend's diving a diver conducted 
dives of 25m for 31 min followed, just over 2 hours later, by a 
dive to a maximum depth of 26m.  Towards the end of the dive,

 NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2011   
at a depth of 23m, the diver deployed her delayed SMB in mid-
water.  She was lifted upwards by the delayed SMB about 1 m 
during deployment.  She tried to counteract this by breathing 
out and dumping air from her BCD.  However, the line had 
become caught and she continued to ascend to 10m at which 
point she released the reel.  The diver was unable to dump 
sufficient air and continued to ascend directly to the surface.  
Her buddy followed her up and conducted a 4 minute safety 
stop at 6m and surfaced normally.  Once back on the boat, the 
diver felt light- 
headed. The skipper of the charter boat asked if she had any 
other symptoms and she reported there were none.  After a few 
min she began to feel nauseous but had been similarly 
nauseous with seasickness over the weekend.  The diver asked 
the skipper to prepare the oxygen set but wanted to wait and 
seek advice from other divers once they surfaced and regained 
the boat.  Once back onboard other divers recommended that 
the diver lay down and breathe oxygen as a precaution.  The 
skipper wanted to call the Coastguard but the diver asked for 
the DCI helpline to be called first and they advised to remain on 
oxygen and monitor.  The Coastguard was also contacted and 
arranged for the boat to be met by an ambulance back in 
harbour.  The diver was taken by ambulance to hospital for 
checks which proved to be normal and she was discharged. 
August 2011 11/327 
Milford Haven Coastguard tasked Fishguard CRT, Preselli 
sector manager and Welsh ambulance service to attend an 
inexperienced diver who ascended too quickly, the instructor 
was concerned about water inhalation and secondary drowning. 
The casualty returned to Fishguard on the dive vessel after 
assessment by the ambulance service paramedic.  (Coastguard 
report).

Hornsea rescue reported they were administering oxygen to a 
diver from a dive support vessel that had made an uncontrolled 
ascent from 20m and was now on the beach at Hornsea. The 
dive boat had independently made contact with the hyperbaric 
unit at Hull prior to the MRCC being aware there was a 
problem.  An ambulance was requested to transport the 
casualty to Hull and the Institute of Naval Medicine was 
consulted.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2011 11/336 
Yarmouth Coastguard tasked Happisburgh lifeboat to evacuate 
a sport diver from a dive boat, who had suffered a rapid ascent 
off Happisburgh. He was taken to the decompression chamber 
of the James Paget hospital by ambulance.  (Coastguard & 
RNLI reports). 
September 2011 11/169 
The previous day two divers had conducted dives to 35m for 33 
min with a 3 min safety stop at 6m and, 3 hours later, to 27m for 
48 min with a 3 min safety stop at 6m.  The next day the divers 
descended a shotline to a wreck at a maximum depth of 35m.  
At the bottom of the shot the pair were disturbed by divers from 
another group and they separated for approximately one 
minute.  The pair reunited and proceeded as planned towards 
the bow of the wreck.  The less experienced diver seemed 
apprehensive, was slow to respond to signals and may have 
been suffering from narcosis.  The dive plan had been to 
experience mandatory decompression and the pair were to 
commence their ascent once their computers recorded 
mandatory stops required.  The less experienced diver became 
increasingly anxious and signalled to ascend.  The lead diver 
then deployed his delayed SMB without problem and the pair 
made a normal ascent to 6m although the inexperienced diver 
appeared to be holding the line tighter than normal.  At 6m the 
lead diver completed his mandatory 3 min of stops.  The less 
experienced diver still appeared anxious, lost buoyancy control, 
attempted to dump air but surfaced nevertheless.  The lead 
diver made a normal ascent and, on surfacing, signalled the 
boat that they had some difficulties.  At this point he discovered 
that the other diver was entangled in the delayed SMB line.  
Once the boat was alongside and the diver was firmly in contact 
with it, the lead diver cut the line free.  Both divers were 
recovered and placed on oxygen. The Coastguard was alerted, 
the boat made for harbour and they were met by an ambulance 
that transferred both divers to a recompression chamber.  At the 
chamber both divers remained on oxygen for a total of 3 hours 
45 min but were not recompressed.  No symptoms of DCI 
appeared and both were advised not to dive again for 24 hours. 
September 2011 11/342 
Milford Haven Coastguard was informed of a diver upon 
resurfacing having missed a decompression stop near Pwll 
Deri. A radio medical advice call was set up. Following the 
medical advice the vessel returned to port where the casualty 
was met by Fishguard coast rescue team, the diver was 
asymptomatic.  (Coastguard report). 
September 2011 11/166 
During a training dive, to a maximum depth of 10m, a student 
had a problem with her mask clearing and she made a rapid 
ascent to the surface.  Her instructor made a normal ascent.  
The total dive time was approximately 10 min.  Neither diver 
showed any symptoms and the student was given a cup of tea 
and a blanket.  Both divers declined oxygen. 
September 2011 11/404 
Three instructors and four trainees dived to 16m.  After 
practicing some skill two instructors and three trainees moved 
down to 24m leaving one instructor and a trainee behind.  One 
of the three trainees then started to panic.  One of the 
instructors ascended with the panicked diver.  At 7m the 
troubled diver started a rapid ascent.  The instructor stopped at 
5m for a 3 min safety stop, and then ascended to find the 
trainee, at the surface, unconscious but breathing.  The 
instructor towed the casualty towards an oncoming rescue boat 
which took him to the shore.  An ambulance took him to 
hospital.

February 2011 11/185 
A diver and his buddy conducted a dive to a maximum depth of 
20m.  Towards the end of the dive the diver removed his main 
regulator to inflate his delayed SMB, a practice he had done in 
the past with no issues.  The diver inadvertently dropped his 
regulator and was unable to retrieve it quickly enough.  He tried 
to locate his octopus but was unable to find it and started to 
panic a little.  The diver then reached for his buddy's alternate 
source.  He thought that he had disabled the anti-free flow 
device but got a mouthful of water having forgotten to purge the 
regulator.  The diver was now panicking and grabbed his 
buddy's main regulator from his mouth dislodging the buddy's 
mask in the process.  His buddy managed to locate his own 
pony cylinder regulator and replace his mask whilst starting to 
ascend.  The distressed diver, having managed to get some air, 
found and replaced his own main regulator.  At this point the 
two divers had separated from each other.  The buddy 
continued his ascent to the surface.  The diver made his way 
back to the planned exit point and surfaced to see his buddy 
50m away.

Falmouth Coastguard received several 999 calls reporting two 
divers waving and shouting for assistance, the divers finned 
back on the surface to the shore, they were met by Falmouth 
CRT, the divers had inadvertently knocked the bezel on the 
compass, when they thought they were close to shore they 
were in fact going out to sea, safety advice was given.  
(Coastguard & RNLI reports). 
July 2011 11/405 
Two divers prepared to conduct a dive to a planned maximum 
depth of 23m.  The first diver had a 15 lt main cylinder and a 3 lt 
pony cylinder mounted on his right-hand side.  The second 
diver had a similar configuration, but had removed the 
alternative air source from his main regulator because it had 
leaked.  The second diver's pony cylinder was mounted upside 
down on his main cylinder and the valve was turned off.  They 
commenced their dive but after 10 min at a depth of 16m the 
first diver had difficulty getting air.  He tried purging his regulator 
and then spat it out.  He then found his pony regulator, which 
was floating free rather than being clipped on.  He tried this 
regulator but could not get any air from it.  Starting to panic he 
swam to his buddy and grabbed the buddy's pony regulator and 
the buddy turned it on.  The troubled diver had swallowed some 
seawater.  The buddy brought them both safely to the surface 
where they were recovered into a boat.  It was then discovered 
that the diver had entered the water with his pony regulator in 
his mouth instead of his main regulator.  His pony cylinder was 
empty and his main cylinder had not been used.  The diver was 
shaken by the event, but suffered no ill effects and he dived 
again the following day.  His main and pony regulators were 
nearly identical, with both hoses coming over his right shoulder.  
He hadn't checked his air during the dive.  His pony cylinder 
had a pressure gauge but it had been tucked away behind the 
diver. 
August 2011 11/139 
An instructor was conducting a rebreather instructor training 
course with two other divers when he noticed a lone diver with a 
single cylinder walking along the bottom of the quarry.  Visibility 
was at least 10m and there was no sign of the lone diver's 
buddy.  The diver was walking on his fin tips with his BCD 
controls held above his head.  The instructor decided to 
investigate whilst his students deployed delayed SMBs.  The 
instructor gave the lone diver an OK signal and received an 
enthusiastic nodding and returned OK signal.  The diver then 
tried to ascend but failed to get more than a metre from the 
bottom before sinking back down.  The instructor offered to lift 
him but he was waved away and the diver made another failed 
attempt at an ascent.  The instructor then gave an 'Up' signal, 
gripped the diver and injected some air into the diver's BCD, 
whilst the diver retained a hold on the controls.  The pair 
managed to rise around two thirds of the way to the surface 
before the diver suddenly dumped all his air and sank rapidly 
with the instructor in pursuit.  The instructor then raised the 
diver to the surface using a controlled buoyant lift.  On the 
surface the instructor fully inflated the diver's BCD, which barely 
kept the diver's head above water. When asked how much 
weight he was carrying he replied 12 to 14 kg.  The diver was 
asked how much experience he had and replied around 30 
dives.  The instructor indicated that they should swim on the 
surface to the exit point around 50m away at which point the 
instructor noticed another diver on the surface 20 to 30m away 
who turned out to be the diver's buddy.  The pair reunited and 
swam back to the exit point together.

Equipment Incidents 
 
 
March 2011 11/035 
Three divers were conducting a dive to a maximum planned 
depth of 40m. During the descent one diver experienced a 
slight free flow at 25m, which he corrected by adjusting the pre-
dive setting and purging the regulator slightly.  The group 
continued the descent to 40m.  During the ascent at around 
30m the regulator again went into free flow and could not be 
stopped.  The diver signalled to his buddies and received an 
alternate source.  His 15 ltr cylinder emptied from 150 bar to 
zero in approximately 2 min.  The group ascended, completing 
a 1 min deep stop required by one of their computers.  At 15m 
the diver switched to his own 3 ltr pony, they completed a 3 min 
safety stop at 5m and then surfaced without further incident. 
June 2011 11/085 
Following a dive to a maximum depth of 18m for a duration of 
30 min a diver and his buddy conducted 4 min of stops at 5m.  
The diver then experienced difficulty inflating his drysuit at a 
depth of 2m.  The diver surfaced with difficulty, attempted 
inflation but nothing happened and he started hyperventilating.  
A rescue boat attended the distressed diver, de-kitted him, 
calmed him down and gave a lift back to shore.  No further 
treatment was necessary. 
June 2011 11/090 
Three divers descended to a maximum depth of 15m for a 
training exercise for one of the group, the first exercise being 
mask clearing.  The diver was using a rebreather with a HUD 
device and wore his mask strap under his hood.  The exercise 
began with the diver sliding back his hood in order to remove 
his mask.  On removing his mask the HUD on the rebreather 
mouthpiece was moved up so that on refitting the mask it 
snagged the HUD device and would not reseat.  The diver 
made two further attempts to refit the mask.  He was coughing 
into the rebreather mouthpiece and he held his nose to try and 
regain his composure. The diver made one further attempt and 
the instructor attempted to move the HUD out of the way 
without dislodging the mouthpiece, but without success. The 
diver could now be heard breathing heavily and coughing 
through his mouthpiece; he gave a clear signal to surface. The 
instructor took a firm hold of the diver and conducted a 
controlled buoyant lift to the surface without further incident. On 
returning to shore the diver again practised the skill in 1.5 m of 
water and confirmed the HUD as the cause of the problem and 
the dive was terminated at that point. No ill effects were 
reported. 
June 2011 11/137 
A diver was conducting a dive through an underwater cave 
system at a depth of 38m when he encountered poor visibility 
and a strong current against him at the maximum depth.  Part 
way through the cave the diver became breathless and 
confused.  He swam towards the light following other divers' fins 
and bailed out onto his open circuit gas. The diver used an auto 
bailout mouthpiece on his rebreather but still found it mentally 
difficult to co- 
ordinate switching gas and felt an overriding sense of doom and 
despondency.  Once outside the cave system the diver 
ascended to 15m and deployed his delayed SMB.  He stopped 
and flushed his breathing loop but was unable to get his rapid 
breathing to reduce.  The diver surfaced and inflated his suit 
and BCD and rested on his delayed SMB but still could not get 
his breath back.  The charter boat recovered the diver and other 
divers and the crew assisted in de-kitting the diver and gave 
him oxygen.  It took a further 10 min to return his breathing back 
to normal.  Subsequent checks indicted that the scrubber unit 
may have been loosely packed and consensus was that the 
diver had suffered a CO2 hit. 
July 2011 11/113 
A pair of divers and their instructor had successfully completed 
a training dive 2 hours previously.  The pair entered the water 
for a second dive with their instructor and a fourth diver who 
was looking for additional experience.  After practicing mask 
clearing drills, the pair prepared to practise alternate source 
ascents.  On a prearranged signal one signalled 'Out of Gas' 
and took his buddy's octopus, removed his own regulator and 
switched to breathe from the octopus regulator.  On removing 
his own regulator it began to free flow.  Despite attempts to halt 
the free flow it could not be stopped.  The instructor offered his 
own octopus which was on a long hose and an ascent was 
made to the surface.  Shortly before reaching the surface, the 
free flow stopped and once on the surface it was noted that the 
contents gauge read empty.  There was sufficient gas 
remaining in the cylinder to allow the diver to inflate his BCD.  
The group swam to the exit point with the diver still breathing 
from the instructor's long hose octopus. 
July 2011 11/125 
On the last dive of a week long twelve dive charter boat trip a 
pair of divers entered the water and descended to a wreck at 
21m.  At the bottom of the shotline one of the divers could hear 
a lot of air escaping from behind his head.  He signalled his 
buddy to check his equipment and he immediately signalled to 
abort the dive.  The diver monitored his pressure gauge and 
noted that the pressure was falling at a steady but a slow rate.  
His buddy removed his alternate source and offered it to the 
diver but the diver signalled that it was OK and he continued to 
breathe from his own cylinder.  The pair swam the short 
distance back to the shotline and made a slow controlled 
ascent.  Other members in the group passed them on the 
shotline and signalled to check the diver was OK and received 
confirmation that the situation was under control.  The pair of 
divers conducted a safety stop of 3 min at 6m as a precaution 
due to the week long diving and surfaced after a total in water 
time of 10 min.  The diver inflated his BCD, switched to his 
buddy's alternate source, asked his buddy to turn off his 
cylinder and the pair were recovered by their charter boat.  
Once back onboard checks were made and the diver found that 
his 15 ltr cylinder had reduced from 210 bar to 130 bar in 10 
min.  Inspection of the cylinder found that the O ring on the 
on/off wheel had blown out. 
August 2011 11/144 
A diver was conducting a dive to a maximum depth of 44m 
using air and carrying two stage cylinders of nitrox 32 and nitrox 
50.  On returning to the shotline at 40m the diver appeared to 
run out of air in his twin-set although his pressure gauge read 
100 bar.  The diver decided to switch to his nitrox 32 but in 
doing so got a mouthful of water.  His buddy had already started 
up the shotline and was out of reach so the diver decided to 
switch to his nitrox 50 even though he was well below his MOD 
for this gas.  He decided to omit his planned deep 
decompression stops and conduct all his required stops at 6m.  
At 6m the diver was reunited with his buddy and another diver 
and indicated that he did not have sufficient gas to complete his 
decompression.  The other diver was on a rebreather and had 
cleared his requirements and so passed over his stage cylinder 
of nitrox 54.  The diver remained at 6m until his computer had 
?BSAC - 2012   41 

   NDC Diving Incidents Report - 2011 
cleared and then surfaced safely.  On inspection it was found 
that his main cylinder valve was turned off and had been the 
cause of the out of gas incident.  The diver suggests that this 
valve may have been turned off by contact with the shotline.  
The nitrox 32 cylinder regulator first stage had come loose and 
had been the cause of water in the second stage. 
August 2011 11/147 
A diver entered the water from a charter boat for a wreck dive 
and sank deeper in the water than expected; his mask was 
flooded and displaced.  The diver made for the surface and 
tried to inflate his wing.  The diver's buddy had already 
descended down the shotline and waited for the diver at the 
bottom. The diver found that his wing would not stay inflated 
and he held onto the shotline continuing to inflate his wing.  He 
was unable to realign and clear his mask with the one hand he 
had free and so removed the mask and held onto it.  The diver 
dropped weights from his front pouches which improved the 
situation but he still needed to hold onto the shot to keep his 
head above water.  The diver was unable to access the weights 
that were strapped onto his twin cylinders.  The diver began to 
panic and, having already removed his mask, threw his 
regulator from his mouth and was seen to be attempting to pull 
his hood off.  Another diver on the charter boat preparing to dive 
noticed the diver without a mask and asked if he was OK to 
which he indicated he was not.  The second diver entered the 
water.  She found the diver was very heavy in the water but she 
was able to support him by inflating her own BCD and suit 
which kept both high in the water.  The pair then drifted away 
from the shotline to allow the boat to pick them up.  The diver's 
buddy eventually surfaced having completed a dive with 
another pair of divers.  Inspection of the diver's wing found that 
the inflation valve was incorrectly seated and leaked and the 
wing bladder had two small punctures allowing a slow release 
of gas.  The diver used twin12 ltr cylinders and carried a total of 
15 kg of weight.

Miscellaneous Incidents 
 
 
November 2010 11/385 
A trainee was completing the mask clearing skill, at a depth of 
6m, when she froze and then started to swim to the surface.  The 
instructor took hold of her BCD and controlled the ascent.  At the 
surface they waited for the rescue boat which picked up the 
trainee while the instructor went back to bring the rest of the 
class up to the surface.  The casualty screamed all the way to 
shore, then had her vital signs checked and calmed down.  No 
subsequent ill effects were reported. 
April 2011 11/389 
A trainee was engaged in a diving course.  After descending to 
2m she returned to the surface.  Upon being asked, she said she 
was fine but nervous and wanted to descend again.  Shortly 
after, she indicated that she wanted to ascend.  After ascending 
with an instructor, she stated that she did not want to continue.  
She was escorted to shore and out of water.  The next day, she 
withdrew from the course.  Her husband stated she suffered from 
claustrophobia. 
April 2011 11/037 
A pair of divers were seen to enter the water for a shore dive but, 
after a few minutes, did not start the dive but turned round and 
started to exit the water.  Approximately 10m from shore, in 
waist-deep water, one of the divers fell over and his buddy 
appeared to be unable to help him to his feet.  This was 
witnessed by a group of divers who were carrying out surface 
instruction nearby and they went to assist.  The diver who had 
fallen over was found to be having difficulty because his cylinder 
had slipped out of its cam band.  The diver was helped to stand 
and both divers escorted from the water.  The pair of divers were 
on the first dive of the season and had been advised by a friend 
that the water was warm so both had opted to dive without hood 
or gloves and one had decided not to wear an undersuit.  On 
entering the water they discovered that the water was too cold 
and so decided to abort the dive.  On the way out of the water 
one of them spotted a frog in the other diver's cummerbund and 
when he pointed it out the other diver was startled and fell over 
and was unable to stand again because of his cylinder falling out 
of the cam band.  Neither diver suffered any ill effects.

Fatalities 
November 2010 11/001 
On the third day of a diving trip to the Red Sea a pair of divers 
entered the water with the rest of their group to dive on the SW 
end of an offshore island. There was a moderate swell on the 
surface and one of the divers drifted away from the group 
slightly before being called back. He pulled himself along the 
mooring line and was repeatedly lifted high in the water as he 
made his way back to the group but he settled down as he 
submerged. The group descended with the dive guide to a 
depth of 25m where the buddy pair exchanged OK signals. The 
pair then continued with a descent to 35m which they reached 
around 10 min into the dive. One of the divers noticed that apart 
from two divers who had stayed on the reef the group had 
swum into blue water around 30m and were difficult to see. The 
diver looked around for his buddy but could not see him and 
assumed he had gone with the larger group and so he joined 
the pair of divers on the reef and followed them slowly back up 
the reef towards the surface continuing to look for his buddy. 
Meanwhile his buddy had ascended rapidly from a depth of 29m 
and was spotted by the boat crew floating face down on the 
surface. He was recovered on board but was pronounced dead 
at the scene. A post mortem conducted in the UK found 
evidence of lung trauma and drowning but neither were 
conclusive. 
 
 
 
Decompression Illness 
August 2011 11/095 
Following a dive to 30m for 54 min including a 3 min safety stop 
at 6m using nitrox 33 and a surface interval of 1 hr 45 min a 
diver and her buddy conducted a second dive to 29m for 52 min 
including a 3 min safety stop at 6m using nitrox 34.  
Approximately 3 min after boarding the boat the diver reported 
feeling dizzy and was immediately sat down and given oxygen.  
Within 2 min the diver reported she could not breathe and was 
laid down, continued on oxygen but on free flow at 25 ltr per min 
and appeared to lose consciousness.  The diver was checked 
and then placed in the recovery position.  A call was made to 
shore to activate the emergency plan and the boat made its way 
back to harbour whilst the diver remained on oxygen.  The boat 
was stopped twice briefly whilst checks were made and, 
although there was some improvement in breathing, the diver 
remained unconscious.  The boat arrived back at shore after 
approximately 45 min and the diver was transferred to hospital 
by ambulance, still on oxygen.  The diver was transferred to a 
hyperbaric facility for recompression treatment and then was 
transferred to an intensive care unit.  The diver received 
extensive treatment in intensive care and subsequently in 
hospital and was released home some several weeks later.  
The diver  required significant follow-on physiotherapy. 
 
 
 
Illness / Injury 
October 2010 11/013 
A dive boat approached a shotline close to the shore, from 
upwind, and deployed three divers, from the port side, with the 
boat in neutral.  After deploying the divers the cox put the  
 
engines into reverse and gave two short bursts in order to move 
away from the divers whilst they made for the shotline. One of 
the divers surfaced behind the boat and one of the other divers 
shouted an alert that he was behind the boat. The engines were 
put into neutral and the diver behind the boat tried to swim out 
of the way but his foot was hit by the still turning propeller. The 
injured diver and his buddies were recovered and the boat 
returned to port where the injured diver was taken to a local 
clinic for treatment. The injured diver received eight stitches for 
a gash to his foot. 
January 2011 11/034 
Two divers rolled backwards into the water from a dive boat.  
Before he had surfaced again, one of the divers was hit on the 
head by the hull of the boat which had reared up in the swell.  
The blow to the head removed the diver's mask and demand 
valve and the mask was lost.  The diver asked to be checked by 
the supervisor on the boat, received a replacement mask and 
was cleared to dive.  No long term effects. 
March 2011 11/040 
A group of five divers entered the water from an RHIB all at the 
same time.  One of the divers struck his head on the cylinder of 
one of the other divers causing a cut approximately 2.5 cm long, 
which bled profusely.  The diver was recovered from the water 
and his dive aborted.  A surgeon onboard the boat cleaned the 
wound and closed it with four resorbable sutures.  The diver 
was advised not to dive for five days and was given anti-
inflammatory medication.  After five days the wound had healed 
and the diver completed two dives without further incident. 
April 2011 11/047 
Following a day's diving from a day boat, the boat returned to 
the jetty and divers were disembarked.  One diver stopped to 
talk to the dive guide and was hit on the head by an unsecured 
boat ladder.  The diver suffered injury to her head and shoulder 
but X-rays showed no broken bones.  On returning to the UK 
the diver visited her GP with symptoms of headache, lethargy 
and inability to think clearly which was diagnosed as a 
consequence of concussion. 
May 2011 11/065 
Three divers entered the water for a deep dive on an offshore 
site.  The divers descended to a maximum depth of 38m and 
then slowly made their way back up the reef, planning to 
conduct no more than 10 min decompression stops.  After 
approximately 10 min, one of the divers indicated there was a 
problem and pointed to her head.  It was assumed this was 
narcosis.  Their ascent up the reef had already commenced 
and, at 12 min at a depth of 24m, the diver signalled, with a 
double OK, that she was now alright.  The dive continued but 
the diver did not seem to be paying attention and started 
heading away in the opposite direction to the deco station.  One 
of the other divers decided to take control and deployed a 
delayed SMB and terminated the dive.  During the ascent the 
diver seemed, uncharacteristically, to be focussed solely on her 
instruments and so her buddy began assisting her ascent to 6m 
where they had at least 9 min of decompression stops to 
conduct.  The buddy donated his deco stage containing nitrox 
40 to the diver but her responses were slow and she dropped 
her regulator causing it to free flow.  The diver was calm but 
lethargic and her buddy could not keep her attention and he had

difficulty controlling buoyancy for both of them. Whilst struggling 
to control the stop depth the buddy noticed that the diver 
appeared to be blacking out and was unable to grip the 
regulator in her mouth properly.  The buddy took her to the 
surface missing 4 min of decompression stops, whilst the third 
diver in the group completed his stops and surfaced normally a 
few min later.  On the surface the buddy inflated the diver's 
BCD, removed her mask and opened her airway.  The diver 
was semiconscious and breathing.  The boat was anchored 
50m away so the buddy started towing the diver to the boat 
alerting the crew.  The diver was recovered and placed on 
oxygen.  A local police launch was alongside checking dive 
permits and assisted by calling the shore and arranging for an 
ambulance.  They then transferred the three divers to the 
launch and returned to port.  On shore the ambulance 
transported the diver to hospital but doctors appeared to have 
little knowledge of diving injuries and placed her on oxygen for 
an hour and then she was discharged.  Contact was eventually 
made with a doctor at the local recompression chamber who 
advised both the diver and her buddy attend for assessment.  
The diver was found to be complaining of a headache but no 
other pain, whilst the buddy had some blurred vision and pain in 
his shoulder, which he believed might be sympathetic 
symptoms.  The diver was kept in for several hours, treated with 
fluids and kept under observation, whilst the buddy was 
released. The diver had spent the previous day filling cylinders 
for several hours from an outside compressor and storage 
bank, had had very little to drink and had had an early start on 
the morning of the dive. 
June 2011 11/091 
Two divers were preparing to enter the water from an RHIB.  As 
the divers rolled backwards, on the dive manager's signal, the 
two came into contact and one diver hit his head on part of his 
buddy's kit. The diver suffered a 2 cm gash to his head that bled 
profusely.  The dive was aborted and both divers were 
recovered from the water.  The injured diver received first aid 
and was taken to a local hospital where he received two 
stitches and had the wound dressed. 
June 2011 11/107 
During the first open water dive for a Sports diver course, a 
diver complained of feeling sick and the dive was terminated 
after 10 min at 2m.  The diver had apparently felt unwell the day 
before.  The diver was referred to a medical facility and was 
cleared to continue the course the next day. 
July 2011 11/179 
A group of five divers entered the water from a hardboat and 
were towed by a small zodiac to a shotline buoy.  On arrival, 
one of the divers displayed symptoms of gasping and acute 
pain and so was recovered by the zodiac and returned to the 
boat.  The rest of the group descended to a maximum depth of 
15m.  Although one of the divers seemed over-weighted this did 
not appear to cause her any distress at the time.  Approximately 
8 min into the dive, the over-weighted diver signalled she was 
unhappy and wanted to ascend to the surface.  She was 
accompanied to the surface and a normal ascent was made.  
On the surface the diver seemed short of breath and began 
coughing and spluttering and was encouraged to relax.  The 
diver was recovered by zodiac and returned to the hardboat 
which then returned to harbour which took approximately 10 
min.  The diver continued coughing and on returning to her 
accommodation (approximately 10 min walk) she still felt 
unwell.  She was taken to the local hospital and then transferred 
to a recompression facility 30 km away as a precaution.  The 
diver was kept in hospital overnight and given oxygen and IV 
fluids.  The diver was discharged the following day and advised 
not to dive for a minimum of three weeks and to avoid 
immersing her head in water.  After visiting a doctor two days 
later she was advised that the cough could be expected to 
dissipate over a few days.  Subsequent medical examination 
showed her chest was improving but that she should expect 
some coughing and discomfort for a further two to three weeks. 
August 2011 11/175 
A diver woke in the morning after diving and reported feeling 
dizzy.  She was placed on oxygen and her dive profiles were 
checked but showed nothing unusual.  The diver was given 
rehydration fluids and continued on oxygen with a 5 minute 
break.  Her buddy was also checked and displayed no adverse 
symptoms.  The diver remain on oxygen for an hour and half 
and was then told to rest, to stay out of the sun and to report 
any adverse symptoms.  None occurred and the diver made a 
complete recovery. 
August 2011 11/176 
During a diving holiday after a number of days diving, a diver 
had completed two dives during a day; to 22m for 36 min with 3 
min safety stop at 6m and, 4 hours later, to 16m for 48 min with 
3 min safety stop at 6m. Following the last dive, the diver 
complained of numbness in her fingers and arm and dizziness.  
The diver was placed on oxygen and her computer checked 
and found to indicate an ascent rate warning over the last 4m of 
the ascent.  After 10 min on oxygen, the diver reported that the 
'pins and needles' were getting worse.  She remained on 
oxygen, lying down, and was given rehydration fluids to drink . 
Regular checks were made and a duty medical officer 
contacted for advice.  He diagnosed a muscle strain and 
advised to hydrate well and not to dive again until all symptoms 
had resolved. 
September 2011 11/173 
During the third open water dive of a training course a student 
was unable to clear his ears at a depth of 7m on a dive planned 
for a maximum depth of 15m.  The dive was aborted and 
medical advice sought.  The student was advised that he could 
continue diving. 
 
 
 
Boating and Surface 
August 2011 11/168 
A dive RHIB covering two divers in the water on a wreck site 
suffered an inoperable twist throttle control on the outboard 
engine which meant the engine could only be operated at tick-
over speed.  Attempts to repair the problem were not possible 
due to a limited set of tools onboard.  The decision was made to 
stand-down a pair of divers who were preparing to dive and to 
recall the divers already in the water.  Attempts were made to 
recall the divers but these attempts failed.  The divers 
eventually surfaced as planned and were recovered and the 
RHIB returned to harbour.  Subsequent checks revealed that a 
grub screw below the rubber twist grip had worked loose, this 
was tightened and the twist grip refitted.  Additional tools were 
added to the boat's tool kit. 
 
 
 
Technique 
July 2011 11/109 
A diver was preparing to dive to a maximum depth of 25m for 
depth progression experience.  The diver had checked his 
equipment before loading it onto the boat.  On site the diver 
attempted to turn his gas on and found that the hand wheel 
?BSAC - 2012   45

46  ©BSAC - 2012 
turned freely and would not turn the gas on.  A replacement 
wheel was fitted.  The diver was then observed trying to turn the 
valve in the wrong direction, tightening the handle.  He received 
advice on the correct method. 
 
 
 
Equipment 
July 2011 11/106 
A diver entered the water for a planned dive to a maximum 
depth of 17m.  On entering the water and preparing to descend 
the diver's pony cylinder second stage free flowed.  The diver 
stopped the free flow, regained control, signalled OK and 
commenced the descent.  During the dive, a short time later 
and at a depth of 14m, the diver experienced difficulty breathing 
from his regulator.  On checking his contents gauges, he 
realised that he had inadvertently been breathing from his pony 
cylinder instead of his main cylinder.  The diver switched to his 
primary gas source, made a normal ascent, completed the dive 
without further problems and surfaced after a total dive duration 
of 35 min. 
July 2011 11/110 
A diver turned his gas on prior to a dive.  As he turned the gas 
on the HP hose burst.  The regulator was exchanged for 
another from a diver from a previous wave and the diver 
proceeded to dive without further incident.
